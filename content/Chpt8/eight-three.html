            With the tornado warnings, you guys were requested to come in earlier than usual just to avoid them when travelling to work. You were in your lab when Dave entered telling you about Ryan and Walter being in the field heading towards a crime scene, so moving quickly, you took out your phone calling Ryan as you headed towards H's direction. While on your way there you heard the news and it was bad about the tornadoes, and the same time you managed to see Eric and H "Hey!" you called for them and they turned to look at you "Have you been able to get hold of Ryan?" Eric asked and you shook your head as you hung up from the voicemail for the fifth time "I'm getting nothing, I even tried Walter but no luck." you said walking with them now "Well, they're heading to an area that's in the evacuation zone." Eric commented looking between you two and your heart sank at that "We gotta get them out of there." H said starting to move off "Let me go with you guys." you said making them halt to look at you "That's too dangerous to ask of you Heather." H stated and you shook your head "I don't care, that's my husband out there and I know you're my boss but my mind isn't going to be settled staying here knowing he's out there." you said sternly so Eric and Horatio shared a quick look "Okay, let's go." H obliged because he knew that it would be futile arguing with you over the matter.

        <p class="story">
            While in the hummer on the way there, you remained in the back seat and listened as Eric tried to reach the guys over the radio but it was no luck, and it was not looking good at all outside. "Guys, take a look at this." H said making you both look out the window towards a tornado and you just hoped they were going to be okay. The closer you guys got to the scene the strong the wind picked up and harder the rain fell "This is getting worse." H stated trying to keep the car steady "Yeah." both you and Eric managed to say at the same time "Ryan and Walter! Come on guys, pick up your damn radios." Eric shouted into his radio trying once again to reach them but nothing and your heart just keep sinking more "H, we're not going to make it, we can't our run this." Eric said with panic as you guys saw the tornado coming closer "We’ve got no choice. Here we go, hang on tight guys." H instructed as you both hanged on and braced for the worst.

        <p class="story">
            As quick as it came it passed and you guys arrived at the scene to see it was a total disaster, and as you three got out the hummer you saw Walter and you all yelled for him going over "Where's Ryan?" H asked him but you wasted no time in yelling out for Ryan and Eric joined you but it seemed like Walter was out of it so H asked him again "Walter, where is Ryan?" he asked more worried this time but got no reply from him so he started yelling for Ryan himself. You guys weren't getting a response and fear started to settle in your chest "Where was the last place you saw him Walter?" H asked as you guys went back towards him "Here. He was helping me move the body to the closet." Walter pointed out and you couldn't believe what you were hearing 'He really risked his life for someone that was already dead' you thought with a sigh "You guys risked your lives to move a dead body." Eric said voicing your thoughts "It was evidence." Walter tried to defend "That was stupid Walter." you said and he gave you a look "Yes, exactly." Eric agreed giving Walter a look then they got into an argument but you were just trying to keep yourself calm "Hang on a second." you said making them shush as you heard something "Do you hear that?" you asked them as you tried to listen "Heather." it was very soft but you all heard it "I see him." H said making a move as you all quickly followed "We got him Heather, he's right here." H said as he approach a car with a cabinet threw onto it, so they quickly lifted it off and Ryan was there, somewhat unconscious, so you quickly went to his side "Ryan." you called and seeing the state he was in quickly brought tears to your eyes "We need a paramedic right here!" H shouted as you both looked over him "Hey baby, take it easy." you said gently taking hold of his face so he could see you "Ryan, you hang in there." Eric called out to him "We got you." you told him just praying that he's going to be okay, Walter stood back and was in total belief at the state Ryan was in but when Ryan coughed you just felt better because he was unconscious "Hang in there son." H comforted lightly tapping his chest "Where's Heather?" Ryan asked him "She's right here." H answered "I'm right here Ryan." you said then paramedics came in and you guys moved out the way so they could do their thing. "Stay with him." H instructed and you nodded "Of course." and you stood with Ryan the whole time, not once leaving his side.

            You were gripping his hand tightly as you guys waited for the results to discharge Ryan from the hospital "I'm okay beautiful." Ryan said making you look up to his bruised face "I know but I thought the worst happened." you said giving him a pained expression and Ryan sighed "But it didn't and I'm still here." Ryan said and just get a doctor came and explained it all to you both giving Ryan the all clear to leave. "Want me to accompany you home?" you asked and Ryan shook his head "I'm going back to work." you gave him a look and was about to say something but Ryan stopped "I'm fine Heather, and I want to see this case to the end." hearing him say that you knew that his mind was already made up so you nodded, "Okay." "Thank you." he said before kissing your forehead and calling a cab.

        <p class="story">You were in the locker room with Ryan as he changed his shirt cause the previous one got pretty wrecked and he knew your silence meant that you were still worried "I'm sorry babe." Ryan said making you look up as you were sitting so you got up now "You're sorry? Babe, how stupid do you have to be to stay in the path of a tornado to just secure a dead body, and I get it, you're dedicated to your job but Ryan if things just went wrong, both you and Walter would have been in that morgue along with that girl." you said sternly towards him not believing he did something so idiotic "But-" you cut him off "There is no buts Ryan, it was foolish, and if you did die, what was I supposed to do with that, how am I supposed to console myself knowing that my husband died stupidly. Come on Ryan." you said letting it out and Ryan just listened cause thinking back it was stupid but he was just focused on his job then and there "I know you're good at what you do, that's why you're where you are today but just remember that I'm also a part of your life." you said with a sigh so Ryan reached for your hands and took them in his "I'm sorry Heather, and yes in that moment I was not thinking but I now see how foolish it was. I'm so so so sorry for making you worried like that. I made you drive through a tornado for me, and as your husband I shouldn't have allowed to have an option like that so I'm sorry." he said bending over to meet your eye level and all you could do was tightly wrap your arms around him still thankful that he's alive. It caught him off guard but he returned the hug by wrapping you in his embrace as well, to help settle heart. You held each other for a moment before pulling away "I love you but please don't ever do something like that again or I swear Ryan, I'm going to kill you myself." you said giving him a hard punch on his arm making Ryan quickly grab it "Damn babe." he said ready to complain but you gave him a hard glare "Okay, I deserved that." he said with a nod rubbing his arm before smiling down at you "Don't smile at me, I'm still mad at you." you said with a pointed finger "I have to get back to work, so no more stupidness or you'll get more than that punch." you warned and Ryan nodded with a gulp "Good." you said before leaning up to peck his lips before turning to leave and Ryan just stood there completely confused "Does she love me or hate me?" Ryan voiced to himself.

            "Hey Wolfe, what are you doing here, I thought you were in the hospital?" Walter asked as he say Ryan enter the lab "The doctors said I'm fine." Ryan told him "Forget the doctors, Heather allowed you come back to work?" Walter asked and Ryan tilted his head side to side "She didn’t want me too but I convinced her and received a scolding and a beating so I think that makes us even." Ryan said resting a hand on his arm that you punched "You hurt your arm?" Walter asked and Ryan shook his head "Heather punched me, and boy did it hurt, I could tell she was holding back." Ryan commented and Walter chuckled "She does play derby." Walter commented "It's always the small ones that packs a punch." Ryan said but now Walter was curious about something "Is she still mad, because at the scene she told me how stupid we were, both her and Eric actually?" Walter questioned so Ryan moved to leaned against the desk in front of him "You know, I'm not sure, I think she is." Ryan said confused "What do you mean?" Walter asked confused "Well, she called me stupid, then hugged me, then threatened to kill me, then punched me and lastly kissed me, and that all happened in a span of a couple minutes, so hence my confusion." Ryan said utterly lost and Walter chuckled "I don't know what to tell you man, but she just sounds like a worried wife." Walter said truthfully and Ryan nodded "That I know for sure." he commented before they got started on work.

        <p class="story">
            You guys just got home after hanging out with the team for drinks after the day you all had "So are you still mad at me?" Ryan asked keeping a safe distance waiting for your reply "I'm not. I'm just mostly thankful that you're alive." you commented turning towards him and Ryan took that as his cue that it's safe to approach you, so he wrapped his arms around your waist, pulling you close against him "That's good, because I don't think I can handle a beating from you." Ryan joked making you chuckle "You'll be fine, and I didn't even hit you that hard." Ryan gave you a shocked look "What are you talking about, I experienced real pain from that punch." Ryan said truthfully but you didn't believe him "I don't believe you." "Well you should, you punch really hard, and try not to forget that you play roller derby." Ryan said then it crossed your mind "Oh yeah." then you gave him a shy smile "I'm sorry for hurting you." you said massaging the part you punched earlier "It's okay, I actually deserved it." he said making you chuckle "Well, yeah." you agreed making Ryan scoff the he smiled down at you. "Well, since you've showered already, you can get dinner ready while I go and shower." you told him and he nodded "Yes mam." he said and you guys shared a kiss before pulling away.

            As you both were getting ready for bed you remembered the first shirt Ryan wore to work "Did you remember to bring home the shirt you wore this morning?" you asked turning to look at him "Yeah about that, the tornado destroyed most of it, so that's in a trash bin at the station." your heart sunk "But you looked so gorgeous in that shirt." you sighed "Babe, it was me or the shirt." Ryan said with a laugh "I know." you joined "Don't worry, I'll buy a new one." he told you "No no, let me, plus there are other clothes I've had my eye on that I wanted to buy for you." you said making Ryan roll his eyes "You love dressing me up." he chuckled and you shushed him "You love it." you said with a pointed finger and he nodded coming over to you "That I do, because one, you make me look decent and quit handsome and two, you pick out clothes that whenever I wear them they turn you on, so honestly I find that a win win situation." he said grabbing you at the waist "Guilty." you said raising your hands in surrender and Ryan laughed pulling you down into bed with him "Aren't you going to shower?" you asked him "Nah, I decided to shower at the station, before leaving, wanted to get tornado off of me." you chuckled at his reply "So you're telling me that I missed a wet Ryan fresh out the shower with a towel wrapped lowly around his hips?" you said straddling his lap as he was leaning against the headboard "I'm sorry baby. I know you love when I come out the shower, but I just felt icky." you released a dramatic sigh "It's okay I guess or whatever." he laughed at your words "Let me make it up to you." you raised your brow at that "I'm listening." "I was given a second chance at life, so that means that I'm feeling pretty alive and full of energy." you were about to question him but that's when you felt it and you gave him a smirk "You sure you can do stuff, no pains of discomfort anywhere?" you asked and he shook his head raising his hands to rest on your bum "No mam." he replied with a smile and shake of his head "I love the sound of that." you grinned "I know you would." he said and caught you off guard by flipping you both over, with him above you "Well Mr. Wolfe, what are you waiting for, make it up to me." "You got it Mrs. Wolfe." he said before crashing his lips against yours.
