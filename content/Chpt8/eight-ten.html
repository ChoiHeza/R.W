        "Why is it that I'm feeling your body leaving mine this early in the
        morning?" you heard Ryan spoke up making you pause to look back at him
        "I thought you were still sleeping?" you questioned and he shook his
        head, pulling your body to lay back beside him making you giggle "So,
        answer me, why?" Ryan asked as his arms captured your waist keeping you
        in place "Because I got a message that I'm needed at the office before I
        start at the lab." you told him and Ryan sulked, literally, so you grin
        at that finding him cute. "Tell them you're busy." Ryan commented making
        you laugh "Busy with what exactly?" Ryan shrugged before pulling you
        closer to him "With your husband, and that he loves having your body
        against his early in the morning, or he won't be able to function for
        the rest of the day." the smile on your face just kept growing as a
        laugh erupted from you at Ryan's statement "Gosh you're cute." you said
        taking hold of his face before placing a tender kiss on his lips "Cute
        enough to make you stay in bed?" Ryan teased and you smiled "You are
        cute enough, but it is really important or they wouldn't have contacted
        me." you said with a pout and Ryan sighed "Fine, they win." he said
        kissing your cheek before releasing your body "Don't sulk, you'll get to
        see me throughout the day." you quickly said while getting up "Yeah
        yeah." Ryan said making you laugh so you turned back to look at him
        "You'll be fine baby." you leaned down to give him one more kiss before
        you have to get ready before Ryan has any other ideas.

      <p class="story">
        You were pulling up some info on your tablet when Ryan entered the lab
        "There she is." you heard his voice making you turn to meet his gaze
        "Hey baby." he made you do a double take "Woah." you said as you watched
        him come and stood next to you "What is it?" "You just look really fine.
        Like extra fine, with an 'o'." you told him forgetting what it was that
        you were doing at the computer and that made Ryan smirk at you "Yeah?"
        you nodded and looked around before coming closer "Want to like, ditch
        work and go do a little something something." you half-joked making Ryan
        laugh "Babe, are you actually being serious right now?" Ryan asked and
        you shrugged raising a hand up to run along his clothed chest "Maybe."
        you said but before your thoughts were allowed to venture further, your
        phone beeped with a message reminding you of what you were doing before
        Ryan came in "Shit, you made me forget what I was doing" you sighed
        breaking away from him and Ryan grinned "Me? I did absolutely nothing."
        Ryan stated making you give him a look "Right, being dressed the way you
        are isn't distracting." you said with a roll of your eyes and Ryan
        chuckled but watched you. With the info you needed on your tablet you
        turned to Ryan "Did you need something from me?" you asked him and he
        shook his head "I just came back from the crime scene to hand off some
        evidence for Samantha to process before heading back to scene and
        decided to come and pay you a visit, since I saw you last early this
        morning." Ryan said as you started to leave the lab and he followed
        "It's a good thing I did because we would have been very late." you said
        giving him a look and Ryan smirked "That doesn't sound too bad, and
        based on the way you're reacting, I think it would have been worth it."
        you matched his smirk "We really need to behave." you commented after
        with a sigh and Ryan rested a hand on your lower back "Well, I guess we
        have an evening to look forward to." he said with a wink before spotting
        Sam leaving the lab "Hey Sam, wait up." Ryan called out towards her
        before turning back to you "She probably has the results, so when I get
        back I'll come and look for you." Ryan said with a wink and a tap to
        your lower back "Okay babe." you gave him a smile which he returned
        before leaving your side and you headed your own way.

        "I don't know what it is?" Natalia said as you both were in the locker
        room discussing something "Well, you guys did get off on a bad start."
        you commented referring to her and Sam "Yeah, we're past that." she said
        looking around before coming closer "But, a part of me still doesn't
        like or trust her." Natalia added and you were curious why because to
        you Sam is really sweet "I guess we're entitled to our own opinions, but
        -" you were cut short as you spotted Ryan entering the locker room and
        Natalia noticed looking back "We'll continue this later at the range"
        she said before turning to leave and you both shared a nod. "Hey." Ryan
        greeted but you noticed something was off "Hey, what's wrong?" you asked
        closing your locker before going over to him "Got word of a patrol
        officer, DiLorenzo, was KIA, while I was at the scene with Delko." Ryan
        said looking down and you know he was hurting, so forgetting that you
        guys were at work, you turned his body, to pull him into your embrace
        and Ryan gladly accepted it, hands wrapping around your waist and face
        going into your neck "I'm sorry." was all you said as Ryans' arms
        tightened around you, so you held him there till he felt better.

      <p class="story">
        With your shift winding down, you forgot to tell Ryan that you were
        going to the shooting range with Natalia that evening, because after she
        found out what an amazing shot you were, she made you her new shooting
        partner. So pulling out your phone to call Ryan, you didn't need to
        because he just that moment entered your lab "Hey beautiful." Ryan
        greeted "Hey, I was just about to call you." you said turning to him
        "Sure, needed something?" he was standing next to you now "I'm going to
        the shooting range with Natalia after I'm finished here." you told him
        and he smiled "She's taking advantage of you being a good shot huh?" you
        chuckled and nodded at that "Yes sir, and it's fun. So you don't mind
        right?" you asked him and he shook his head "Of course not, plus I was
        also coming to tell you that I got something extra that H wants me to
        work on." "Oh okay, I guess things worked out well then." you smiled up
        at him and he looked around quick making sure that the coast was clear
        before giving you a quick peck on the lips catching you off guard "That
        was risky." you commented after he stepped away and Ryan grinned "But
        worth it." he said with a wink before starting to walk away "See you at
        home, and be careful at the range." Ryan ordered and you nodded "Yes
        sir." you said with a wink and he was gone.

        "Did you know that she was aiming for CSI?" Natalia asked as you both
        were in between a reload, you nodded "Yeah, that was a goal of hers for
        a while now. Feeling intimidated?" you asked with a chuckle and Natalia
        laughed "You wish. I guess that's good for her or whatever." it was your
        turn to laugh now "Sounds like you're jealous." you commented and
        Natalia scoffed "Please." with guns reloaded you guys fired off the next
        round.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        Targets brought forward, you looked at the results "How is it that
        you're always hitting the target spot on?" Natalia questioned looking
        between your target and hers "I'm just that good baby." you said with a
        proud smile and Natalia chuckle "Just you wait, I'll be beating you."
        you both took off your targets "I'll believe it when I see it." you said
        smugly making her laugh "You know Samantha won the shooting
        competition?" Natalia asked as you guys switched out the targets, you
        nodded "I did but that's only because I didn't compete that time." you
        said with a wink "You should of." she stated and you shook your head
        "Nah, I got tired winning every time, so I decided to give someone else
        a chance." you said proudly and Natalia shook your head "This is why
        you're my shooting partner now." you laughed at that "But you're a great
        shot already." you told her "Yeah, but not perfect enough." she retorted
        back "Then let's get to work."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        You got home before Ryan and let him know that you were bringing in take
        out. Food on the counter, you headed to the bathroom for a shower to get
        washed up before Ryan comes in. All clean, you entered back the bedroom
        and got dressed in one of Ryan's t-shirts and a pair of knickers before
        heading back to the kitchen to take out the food from their containers
        and reheat if necessary. Just as you were plating the food, Ryan came in
        through the door "Hey hun." Ryan called out "Kitchen." you called back
        and it wasn't long before he came into view "Hey, welcome home." you
        said with a wide smile looking up at him "Got what H wanted done?" you
        asked as he came over to the opposite side of the island watching you "I
        did, wasn't anything difficult." you nodded at that "And how was it with
        Natalia?" Ryan asked and you chuckled "Was fun. We talked, hit some
        targets and I gave her some pointers but it was mostly a blow off some
        steam kind of session for her." Ryan raised a brow at that "Why, what's
        going on with her?" Ryan asked curious and the same time you turned to
        get something from the cabinet above and Ryan caught a glimpse to see
        that you weren't wearing anything under the shirt but a pair of knickers
        when you reached up "I don't know if you've noticed but she doesn't like
        Sam all that much." you said going back on your feet before turning to
        see the look that Ryan was giving you "What is it now?" you asked
        knowing that he didn't hear a thing you just said "You're not wearing
        any pants." he commented making you chuckle "I know I'm not, because I
        didn't feel like wearing any." you stated heading back over to the
        island with drinking glasses in hand "I like it. Gives me a nice view."
        Ryan said with a wink making you role your eyes "Go and take a cold
        shower, so you can eat dinner." you told him and he just grinned with a
        shake of his head "Why don't you join me?" Ryan asked pushing himself
        from the island and slowly walking over to you "I've showered already."
        you told him but Ryan pretended to be deaf "Well I choose to ignore it."
        he said and before you had time to protest or put up a fight, he took
        hold of your body, lifting you up and tossing you over his shoulder
        "Ryan!" you called out hitting his back and he just laughed so you
        sighed and shook your head giving up.
