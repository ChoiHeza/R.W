        "I forgot to ask, how was dinner last night with mom?" Ryan asked as you
        both were getting dressed for work "It was pretty good actually and of
        course we talked about you." you said with a grin looking towards Ryan
        before continuing "And she also asked me the golden question." you
        paused and Ryan gave you a look kind of knowing what it was "Let me
        guess, she asked when we're having children?" Ryan asked making you
        laugh with a nod "What did you tell her?" "I said you should ask your
        son because he refuses to give me children after I've been begging and
        begging." you replied trying to hide your smile and Ryan looked at you
        with wide eyes "You told her what!? Babe, you did not say that." Ryan
        looked at you in disbelief and you couldn't help but finally release
        your laugh "I'm sorry." "You were joking?" you nodded at that calming
        down "I told her we've been talking about it, but we just want things to
        be settled and sorted between us so that when we have them they can be
        provided for." you said and Ryan nodded "That's a good answer and I'm
        thankful you're the one that had that conversation with her and not me."
        Ryan said with a chuckle "Well, she did say that she has to give you a
        call so she can have a conversation with you." that took Ryan's smile
        away and he released a sigh making you laugh "You'll be fine." "That's
        easy for you to say because she likes you more." Ryan said and you did a
        flip of your hair "Of course." Ryan just shook his head with a smile,
        happy at the thought that you guys get along really well.

        Ryan and Delko were processing the scene of where a mom was found dead,
        with a crown sticking out her face. Ryan was snapping pictures of
        evidence while Delko was eyes landed on a photo of the victims daughter
        dressed as a pageant girl "You see this?" Delko asked Ryan turning to
        show him the pic and he looked up from writing in his notepad "She
        doesn’t even look real, she looks like a doll." Delko commented
        inspecting the picture "I don't understand why parents put kindergartens
        through this, just let kids be kids." Ryan was annoyed at the situation
        "This is disgusting." Delko said before placing back down the photo "At
        least it's safe to say you guys wouldn't put your kids through this if
        you have any." Ryan shook his head "Of course not. It's not human man,
        but it is funny though that we were talking about having children this
        morning." Ryan stated going back to his notepad "Really?" that made
        Delko smiled and Ryan nodded "Yeah, my mom and Heather had dinner last
        night, and she asked her when we're having children." Ryan said with a
        chuckle and Delko joined "She's starting to sound like the team." that
        made Ryan snap his head towards Delko "What do you mean the team?" Ryan
        asked with a raised brow "We've been wondering as well when will you
        guys have little Wolves." Delko said with a grin making Ryan shake his
        head "Does Heather know about this?" Delko shook his head "Nah, it was
        just a conversation that came up a time while we hanging out." "Wow. Now
        I'm feeling the pressure." Ryan said making them both laugh at that
        before they went back to processing the scene.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Hello beautiful, I have come baring gifts." Ryan voiced as he entered
        your lab "Please be chocolate, please be chocolate." you chanted with
        clasped hands and eyes closed before turning towards Ryan making him
        laugh "Sadly no, it's video tapes from the pageant, but I can buy you
        chocolate later." you grinned at the end bit as Ryan came to stand next
        to you "By the way, did you know that the team are also wondering when
        we're getting kids?" Ryan questioned "Really?" you asked surprised and
        Ryan nodded as he placed the box of tapes on the desk, that made you
        chuckle "I guess the world wants us to have children, even todays case
        might be sign as well." "So….." Ryan said making you look towards him
        "So…..?" you copied him and he chuckled at that "I guess we'll be having
        that conversation?" he asked and you though for a moment before nodding
        "I guess we are, this evening." you commented while reaching for the
        first tape and at that moment, Calleigh entered the lab "Hey, are those
        the tapes from the pageant?" she asked coming next to you guys "Yeah,
        all two hundred and sixty-three of them." Ryan replied "Wow." you and
        Calleigh said at the same time before you guys started to take a look at
        them "We're hoping to catch someone stalking the victim right?" you
        asked and Calleigh nodded "Hopefully." she replied and you started going
        through them "There she is in the lobby." Ryan commented spotting the
        mother so you fast forward to the next occurrence "Hey Heather, why is
        there a feature of snow around them? Do you guys see that?" Calleigh
        asked looking on at the recordings "Yeah, I see it but I'm not sure."
        you replied "That's when a video tape is paused or freeze famed, the
        tape gets damaged." Ryan answered so you and Calleigh looked towards him
        "So you're telling me that people reviewed these tapes and paused where
        these smidges are?" Calleigh asked "Yeah." Ryan replied with a nod so
        Calleigh looked to you "Can you find other artifacts?" Calleigh asked
        you and you nodded "Yeah, sure." you said before starting to go through
        them. Ever smidge appeared when the victim was on screen "So you're
        thinking the killer had access to these tapes?" Ryan asked looking at
        her "Maybe." she replied then you landed on a frame with the mother but
        there was no smidges "Well here's Susan right here and no artifact." you
        stated pointing at the screen, then Calleigh asked if you could find any
        frames with the victim's daughter "There she is, look how blurry it
        becomes." you commented as you played the part "I'm starting to think
        that the focus wasn't on Susan." Ryan said looking at the screen and
        both you and Calleigh agreed "No, I think our killer was after Melrose."
        Calleigh started pulling out her phone "Maybe Susan died protecting her
        daughter." she finished with the phone by her ear "Thanks guys." she
        said giving you both a look before leaving the lab but you continued
        going through the tapes "Hey Ryan, look at this." you said and he looked
        on to see it was another one of the girls "Another artifact. Melrose,
        wasn't the only one being watched." he said before looking towards you
        pulling out his phone "Call Eric, he's with Melrose." you said and he
        nodded before starting to leave "I gotta find Calleigh." with that Ryan
        was gone after giving a quick tap to your lower back.

        "What do you mean it's the coordinators of the event?" you asked Walter
        as you both were heading towards your lab "It's just as I said and we
        gotta find where he currently has Tori." you released a heavy sigh at
        that "What is wrong with the world." you stated as you guys reached your
        lab and headed straight to the surface computer "All we have to go off
        of is a movie theater." "Well, let's get started." you said before you
        guys got to work "Hey guys, I went over Chambers work history and
        there's no record of him being a ticket taker, an usher or candy vendor,
        nothing." Ryan said as he entered the lab coming over to you guys making
        you both look away from the screen "Really? So why a theater?" Walter
        asked him "Well, these are all the theaters in the area." you told Ryan
        pointing at the screen "And a twenty mile radius to the Chambers'
        house." Walter added as you all looked back at the screen "Yeah, and
        they were two movies with cartoon mice that were showing about ten years
        ago, and these are the screens they were played on." you said pulling up
        the theaters on screen "I don't get it, how do you hide a child during
        work hours?" Ryan asked looking between you two "It would be hard
        right?" Walter asked and then Ryan remembered something "Chambers' wife
        said he goes to a special place on Tuesdays." with that a light bulb
        went off in your head "What if it's a theater that's closed on
        Tuesdays?" you queried beginning the search and it didn't take long
        before one popped up "There it is!" you said and Ryan quickly got into
        action pulling out his phone "That's where he's got Tori." he said
        before leaving with the phone to his ear "I hope they get to her in
        time." you said with a sigh while turning to Walter "You and me both."
        he replied as you both shared a worried look and hunched over the desk.

      <p class="story">
        "What. A. Day." you said out loud as you both and Ryan entered the house
        "Tell me about it." you both placed down your bags and took off your
        shoes and being extremely tired, you both made a beeline for the couch
        plopping onto it and remained in the silence for a while. "Can I lay on
        you?" you asked Ryan and he out stretched his arm "Of course." with that
        you moved into his side and laid your head on his chest as he wrapped
        his arm around your waist and you guys stayed like that for a while just
        enjoying the moment "You know, today's case had me thinking." Ryan
        started breaking the silence "About us having our own children, and how
        scary it is for them to be in a world like this." that made you release
        a sigh "The same thought crossed my mind, it definitely is scary." you
        ended by looking up at him "It kind of makes you not want to have kids
        just so they won't experience the dangers." Ryan said truthfully and you
        nodded at that in agreement "But you still want them?" you asked Ryan
        and he looked down at you with a smile "As long as it's with you, of
        course." that made you return his smile "Well, let's make this world a
        better place for them to live in." you said and Ryan nodded before
        leaning down to place a kiss on your lips "So when do you want to start
        trying?" Ryan asked and you went back to laying on his chest "Payment
        for the house should be completed the next couple months so we could
        start trying near the end of the year." you said as you ran your hand
        across Ryan's stomach "That sounds perfect." he kissed your forehead at
        that "I bet your mom would be happy to know this." you said with a grin
        and Ryan chuckled "Let's surprise her, when you're pregnant, then we'll
        tell her." he said and you laughed at that "That poor woman. I hope you
        could handle the pressure from her till then." you commented "I forgot
        about that, but it'll be worth it." Ryan said with a sigh making you
        look up at him with a smile "She's gonna be very happy." "Very." with
        that you guys shared a kiss "Wanna take a bath, I think we deserve it
        and let's order in." Ryan said and you were loving the words that was
        leaving his lips "That sounds perfect." you said getting up and
        outstretched your arm for Ryan to take, which he did pulling himself up
        to stand in front of you and before you had a chance to walk off, his
        arms captured your waist and his head immediately entered your neck
        "Everything okay?" you asked rubbing his back and you felt him nod
        "Everything is perfect." he said with a smile and before placing a kiss
        in your neck making you giggle.
