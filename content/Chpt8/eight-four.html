            "Don't you look cute." you commented as you entered back the bedroom "Yeah?" Ryan asked and you nodded "Yes sir, the cutest." you said in front him now and taking hold of his cheeks in your hands making him chuckle. "I could just eat you up." you said smiling before placing multiple kisses on his lips making Ryan hum with each one, then you remembered something stopping "Why did you stop?" Ryan asked making you chuckle "I just remembered that I'm going out with the girls tonight." you said leaning back "I didn't know about this." Ryan stated with a raised brow "That's why I'm now telling you, I forgot to tell you last night." you told him and he hummed "Where are you guys going?" he asked massaging your waist "They were thinking the club, maybe a bar, but just someplace we could go dancing." you told Ryan, but he remained quiet, thinking "What?" you asked him "I don't know." Ryan said so you raised a brow "You don't know?" you asked him "What don't you know?" you added "How I feel about you going out tonight." you were about to protest but Ryan continued speaking "I'm not going to stop you, I just want you to be safe, that's all." he said truthfully and you smiled "I will be, I always am." you said reassuring him and Ryan sighed "This is where I hate being a trusting husband." Ryan commented making you laugh "Thank you baby." you said before giving him a kiss making him smile and shake his head.

            Today's case didn't go the way the team wanted because the man was a real predictor, abducting women and torturing them, so on the ride home, Ryan was starting to have second thoughts about you going out tonight. The moment you guys stepped into the house and before you had time to run to the bedroom Ryan called out to you "Babe, wait a minute." he said making you halt your steps to look at him "Yeah?" you asked and Ryan sighed "Are you still planning on going out tonight?" you replied with a nod but Ryan remained quiet, hands going into his pockets entering a state of thought "What is it?" you asked curious going back to him "I don't want you going out tonight." Ryan stated making you tilt your head "Why?" "Because of what happened today and we never got the guy." your hands were on your hips now "So wait, you don't want me going out because of what happened today?" you asked trying to understand and Ryan nodded "Yeah." you scoffed "You're joking right?" he shook his head so you shrugged your shoulders "Well, I don't see that as good enough reason for me to not go, so come again." you said clearly not having it and Ryan sighed "I'm serious Heather." he said sternly "So am I Ryan, do you not trust me?" you asked him "I do, but it's men I don't trust." "And if that's your argument, it doesnâ€™t make sense because  men are everywhere, so anything you say is not going to stop me from going." you said finally before turning to leave "Come on Heather." Ryan called stalking after you "No Ryan, I'm not going to allow something like that, stop me from going out and having fun with my friends." you said with a strong voice not turning but continuing your trek to the bedroom, Ryan knew he couldn't change your mind "At least let me come along." you turned at that "What part of it being a girls night that you don't understand?" you questioned "Ryan, I can take care of myself, I'm a grown woman." he was about to protest but you raised your hand "Just stop, whatever it is, the answer is no." you said putting your foot and gave Ryan a look waiting for him to confirm, so he sighed then nod "Fine, do whatever you want." he said clearly annoyed giving up and you didn't had time to deal with his behaviour, so you rolled your eyes and left him.

        <p class="story">
            You were in the mirror checking your final look after putting on your shoes when Ryan entered "Come on babe." Ryan groaned making you look towards him "What now?" you asked annoyed "You can't be dressing like that." he said coming over to you "First, I can't go out, now I can't dress a certain way?" you asked with a raised brow "Men are definitely going to notice you." Ryan stated but you just rolled your eyes again not wanting to get into another argument "Okay." was all you said before you looked back into the mirror "So you're just going to ignore everything I say?" Ryan asked so you sighed heavily before turning to him "I am hearing everything that you're say, I just choose to let it go through one ear and out the next." you said before moving passed him to leave the bedroom and Ryan was trying so hard to keep calm "Why are you trying so hard to irritate me?" Ryan asked following after you now and he saw you were putting some things in your purse "I'm not doing anything." you told him closing your purse before turning to him "Look, since you're being this way, I'm driving myself there." you said jingling your keys in hand before starting to leave "No, let me take you." you shook your head "No, because you don't want me going in the first place." you stated turning back heading for the door "Fine, you are your own woman." Ryan bit back changing direction and headed for the couch, so without another word you left, not wanting Ryan to ruin your night.

            Ryan hated how you guys left things before you left, and he was eating himself up over it, he couldn't even focus on the football game before him. He knows you can take care of yourself, and he does trust you but it's just how unsettling today's case was that it felt him feeling uneasy and that's what he should of told you instead of just demanding you not going. Leaning his head back and looking up at the ceiling, he released a huge sigh "Was I being unfair?" Ryan asked as he looked up and thought for moment before releasing an angry groan "F***" and stood up pulling out his phone, heading towards the bedroom. He checked his phone for your location before changing his clothes. "Why does she have to be so stubborn sometimes." Ryan stated out loud. In the meant time you were at the club, currently sitting at the bar with your friends having a few drinks "And he really let you leave?" Monica asked, after you told them what happened between you and Ryan, so you took a sip of your drink before replying "Not really, I just walked out." you said with a shrug and Monica and Yinli laughed "Girl, I think you're going to be in trouble when you get back home." Yinli commented with a chuckle but you dismissed them "Let's not talk about him, we're here to have fun." you said raising your glass and they all agreed and cheered before you guys clinked your glasses and took a drink.

        <p class="story">
            Ryan arrived and had one thought in mind, finding you but remaining hidden. So scanning the crowd of dancing bodies and spotted nothing but heard a laugh that sounded just like yours, so turning his head, he spotted you, sitting by the bar with Monica and Yinli laughing. He smiled and felt better after seeing you but decided to keep his distance so he got a drink before finding a seat where he could keep an eye on you and Ryan shook his head not believing that he's here stalking his own wife. "Ridiculous." Ryan mumbled before taking a sip of his beer. "Let's get some good music playing in here." Monica grinned before getting up and leaving you and Yinli to share a look, wondering what she's going to do. A minute later she returned with wide smile "Where did you go?" you asked her "To the DJ, told him we have a Bajan in the mix." she said with a wink making you laugh "You did not?" you asked and she nodded right before the DJ made an announcement "We got ourselves a gorgeous lady all the way from Barbados so you guys know what that means!" he said over the P.A system and everyone cheered making you shake your head at her, and before you could say anything Rihanna's 'Don't Stop The Music' started to play, making you grin "We know you love this one." Yinli said joining you so she took hold of both you and Monica's hand, pulling you guys "We gotta dance." you didn't have to be told twice. Not once did Ryan's eyes leave you, he smiled at the announcement that was made for you seeing you grinning and he was happy seeing that you're having fun and not letting what happened between you guys to damper your mood. The moment he heard a song you love starting to play he knew you would immediately go to dance and boy did he enjoy the sight. He wished he was there dancing with you, and it took everything in him to remain seated to not blow his cover.

        <p class="story">
            Ryan watched you dance for several songs with girls before a guy approached you, so the smile that was on his face left instantaneously. Resting down his bottle, Ryan looked on getting ready to move if he needed to "Hey there gorgeous, could help but notice you from across the room." came a voice from behind you making you turn around "Hey, not interested." you told him before turning back around to your friends but the guy wasn't taking that so he rested a hand on your hip coming closer to you "Why not, you're pretty." you closed your eyes and released a sigh, gripping his hand on your hip, you turned to him "I said, I'm not interested, so kindly please take your hands off of me before you regret it." you sternly said dropping his hand back to his side before looking up at him "So you're a brat that needs to be taught a lesson." he said with a smirk so you raised your hand to show him your wedding bands "I'm already spoken for." you said with a smile before going to ignore him once again but he scoffed before reaching to touch your shoulder but the moment his hand landed on you, you turned an captured him twisting it to his back "When a woman says leave her alone, listen to them, cause this woman is a police officer and trust me when I say I'm packing." you said making the guy gulped and winced in pain "I'm sorry, won't happen again." he said clearly terrified "Good." you told him before releasing his arm and he scurried out of there making the girls behind you chuckle and grip your shoulders "Damn girl, that was pretty cool." Monica said and Yinli was also impressed "If I wasn't married, I would of hit on you." she said with a wink making you laugh and shake your head "Letâ€™s dance!" you cheered before you all continued dancing, forgetting the incident that just happened. 
        </p>
        <p class="story">
            The moment the guy took hold of you, Ryan raised to his feet ready to intercede but he saw that he didn't had to because threatened the guy yourself and he don't know what you said but the guy left you scared and running away with his tails between his legs and Ryan couldn't help but release a proud smile at the interaction. He was worried for nothing and he didn't had to follow you here because you can indeed handle yourself, so finishing off his drink, he decided to leave and he'll see you when you come home.
        </p>
        <p class="story">
            You came in around midnight, so you unlocked the door quietly as to not alert your presence, but clearly that was pointless because immediately the light came on and stood there was Ryan, looking at you "Welcome home wife." Ryan said in a tone making you sigh, so closing the door, you discarded your bag, keys and heels. "You stayed up?" you asked staying where you were "It would be hard to sleep knowing you're not home." after how everything went down, you felt bad for how you reacted and talked to Ryan "I'm sorry." were the next words that came out your mouth "I'm sorry for how I spoke to you and-" Ryan cut you off by raising his hand "I'm the one that should be apologizing, for not thinking that you can handle yourself and treating you like you're incapable, you play roller derby for goodness sake." Ryan said with a chuckle at the end and you smiled "So I'm sorry and I was wrong for saying you couldn't go." Ryan said slowly approaching you with his hands in pockets "And I'm sorry as well, I shouldn't have spoken to you like that." you said moving slowly to meet him half way "So we good?" Ryan asked and you smile but you shook your head "Almost." you said and that caused Ryan to tilt his head in confusion "Almost?" he asked and you nodded "I'm not mad, I was but I thought about it." you started making Ryan more confused "Do you mean about the fight from earlier?" Ryan asked and you shook your head before moving much closer to him "So, how were my dancing skills?" you asked him with a raised brow and Ryan swore under his breathe before releasing a sigh "How did you know I was there?" he asked and you smiled "I felt eyes on me, and I knew it had to be you but I thought it was the creep for a moment but after he left I still felt the stares so I managed to look in time to see you leaving." you told him, resting a hand on his chest now and Ryan sighed once more "I'm sorry, I shouldn't have gone there but I was just really worried and I hate how we left things, so I was unsettled." Ryan told you truthfully "I know and that's why I'm not mad." you smiled up at him "But.." you started with a raised for Ryan to continue, so he took the hand that was on your chest into his hold "I won't do it again, because you can handle yourself and I saw for myself, you terrified the guy." Ryan said with a chuckle making you grin "Thank you." you said before tiptoeing and pecking his lips. "So, I'm curious about something." Ryan said and you have an idea as to what he's going to ask "What did you tell the guy?" you chuckled before fully wrapping your arms around his neck and Ryan captured your waist "I said 'When a woman says leave her alone, listen to them, cause this woman is a police officer and trust me when I say I'm packing'" Ryan didnâ€™t know if to be impressed or turned on "That's kind of hot, and were you actually carrying a piece?" you shook your head "Nah, didn't see a need to." you said shaking your head and Ryan felt proud "Watching the interaction was a major turn on, I'm not going to lie, and the fact that you called yourself a police officer, damn baby, I would of taken you there and then." Ryan said inching his face closer to you, but you placed a finger on his lips "No no, you calm down." you said before quickly pecking his lips and removing yourself from his hold "What, why?" Ryan asked, eyes following your body "Because you didn't trust me." you said and Ryan groaned "I did trust you baby, it's the dress, you're too sexy in that dress and that attracts attention. You had so many eyes on your tonight, and a guy was even bold enough to make a move, so could you blame me." Ryan defended following after you as you head for the bedroom "So it's the dress's fault now?" you asked him, turning after you entered the bedroom "No, it's men's fault, we're awful human beings." Ryan said and you pointed a finger "Correct." you said with a smile and Ryan rolled his eyes "I'm going to shower." you said starting to head for the bathroom but Ryan halted you "Wait a minute." he said pulling you back against him, hands gripping your hips, pulling you flushed against him, "What is it now?" you asked him then you felt his breath fan the span of your neck "I didn't get a chance to enjoy you in the dress, and the way you were dancing was such a sight, I couldn't stop thinking about all the things I wanted to do to you." Ryan said while placing kisses along the exposed skin making you smile "And you think you deserve to enjoy me in this dress, after what happened this evening?" you asked him and that made him halt his movements "Come on babe, don't deny me." Ryan said pulling you even closure against him, so you could get the idea "I'm sorry, I was wrong, please." Ryan was practically begging now, so you removed his hold from you and stepped away making Ryan groan but you were going for your phone to play music, putting it on the surround speakers making Ryan confused "What are you doing?" he asked as you rest back down your phone before coming back over to him "You said you wanted to enjoy the dress and I really wanted to dance with you tonight, so.." you said standing in front Ryan now and he caught on, smile reaching his lips as he reached back for your hips. "You are going to be the death of me." Ryan commented before you gave him a wink and turned around to dance on him.
