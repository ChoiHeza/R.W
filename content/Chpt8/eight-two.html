            You woke up and found Ryan sitting at the edge of the bed so you decided to get up and sit behind him to rest your body against his back, bring your arms to wrap around his front "Good morning." you greeted with a kiss to his back before resting your cheek against it "Hey, Good morning beautiful." Ryan said turning to look at you over his shoulder while bringing his hands to join yours "Everything okay baby?" you asked squeezing him tighter and he shook his head before replying "No it is not." worried, you leaned up to look at him "What's wrong?" you asked and before Ryan replied, he brought your body around his, to straddle his lap while moving to lay back against the headboard "I'm not ready for this vacation to be over." Ryan stated bringing his hands to run along your thighs and that caused you to smile "Me too, but our life goes on." you commented and Ryan sighed "I know but it was the best, wasn't it?" Ryan asked smiling now so you nodded with a smile of your own "The best, and your skin proves it." you said running your hands along his arms, while away, Ryan managed to pick up a very beautiful tan. "You think the team will notice?" he asked causing you to chuckle "It's hard not to." Ryan sighed at that so you said something else "It doesn't look back, it just says that you had an amazing time." you said with a grin and that caused Ryan to grip your hips pulling you closer "Well, most of that amazing time happened to be those particular times indoors." Ryan said with a smirk and you immediately caught on releasing a giggle "Well, not all happened indoors." you commented with a raised brow "Oh yeah, there was the beach, the pool and that one time by a cliff." Ryan said grinning recalling the memories making "I think it's something in the air there, that brings out a side of you that I love." Ryan said with a sigh "I want to go back." you chuckled "So me in America is boring?" you asked with a raised brow and Ryan shook his head "Of course not, you're just as amazing here but there it’s different, but a good different, all still good." Ryan rambled to not cause any doubt within you making you laugh "I get you Ryan, it's okay." Ryan rolled his eyes at that "Such a troll you are." you giggled bringing your hands up to wrap around his neck "Well, we still have an hour and some before we're supposed to get ready for work…" you said with a smirk at the end hoping Ryan caught on and of course he did because he pushed your hips down against his "And that's a lot of time to extend our vacation fun." he said with a wink before you pulled him closer by the neck "And I think my body is still on Bajan time." you whispered against his lips making him groan as he took the lead in kissing you first.

            "Ryan Wolfe." you groaned as you entered back the bedroom making him look up towards you "What is it?" he asked a little concerned "You can't be starting this early babe." you commented going over to him and he was just super confused "You gotta help me out love, I'm lost." he said taking hold your waist as you were in front him now "You're wearing a shirt that makes me forget how to act." you said truthfully and Ryan looked down catching on before looking back up with a smile "Well, I did wear it for you." he said and you groaned "It's not fair." you said running your hands over his chest admiring how good he looked "Oh really?" Ryan asked with a raised brow and you nodded "Well, I'm just playing your game hun." Ryan said and now you were the confused one "What game?" you asked "You know, the game where you test my self-control for you." Ryan stated with a raised brow before continuing "You know how I feel exactly about this dress." he said running his hands along your curves before bringing his lips to place kisses in your neck "Um, well I guess we both had our intentions." you said trying to keep your breathe steady from what Ryan was doing, he replied with a hum, sending vibrations through our body before leaning back up to meet your eyes "Jump." he instructed and the moment, you were secured in his arms, his lips found yours heading over to rest you on the desk "I don't think we have enough time." you managed to say as Ryan moved down your jaw, back to your neck "I'll be quick." he said so you caved.

            Although with the little activity Ryan managed to be the first one on the scene, and he was currently leaning against the hummer with a cup of coffee in hand waiting for Natalia. "You did not just make it here before I did." Natalia commented as he approached Ryan with a smile "Good morning slowpoke." Ryan teased with a grin pushing himself off the hummer "I live fifteen minutes from here, so there's no way you'll make it here before me unless, you sirened." she taunted at him and Ryan laughed "There's no way I could of." Ryan commented and Natalia didn't buy it "You cheated." she said with a point of her finger as they started to walk towards the scene "Let's just say I had an energy boost this morning." Ryan smugly said before taking a sip of his coffee making Natalia grin "Even if that was the case, you definitely wouldn’t have gotten here before me." Natalia commented and Ryan shrugged "What can I say, I'm a man of many talents." Natalia laughed at that "So, wanna tell me why I'm missing out on an extra hour that I could have been spending with my wife." Ryan questioned looking towards Natalia and she started to explain what they knew so far, then her jeep started making a noise making her sigh "It's been like this for the past week." she said pressing the button but getting nothing and Ryan chuckled "You go deal with that and I'll check out the scene." Ryan commented and she nodded "Thanks, I'll catch up with you in a bit." she said before turning back heading towards her car.

            When Ryan got there, the door was looked so he just peeped through the glass, to see what he see and it was something very unexpected, right in front the body was a floating hat and Ryan could not believe his eyes "No wonder the bus boy was spooked." Ryan said pulling out his phone to take a picture, just then Natalia appeared with the key and Ryan gave her a look "What, is it bad, please don't be another bloater, I had two of those last week and I can't deal with another one." she commented unlocking the door "No, it's a floater." Ryan said but not even sure himself so when they entered the hat was flat on the ground "I don't follow." she said confused and Ryan pointed at the hat "The hat, it was floating off the ground, I even took a picture." he said showing her the photo because he never moved from it and Natalia smiled giving him a look "I see you took a nice reflection of yourself." she commented making Ryan look at the phone himself and realized he didn’t capture it "Trust me, the hat was floating." Ryan said confidently and Natalia chuckled "How about a little less time with Heather, and more sleep." she joked making Ryan give her a deadpan look.

            Ryan was spooked and the team did not let him live it down, not once. While back at the lab Walter approached you all smiles "Did you hear?" he asked coming over to you so you shook your head "Heard what?" you asked completely intrigued because he could not stop smiling "Before I tell you, let me ask you a question, if you entered a room and you saw a hat floating, what would be your first thought?" Walter asked super curious "There's probably a flow of air, like from a vent or maybe the room was filled with gas." you said and that made Walter laughed catching you off guard "What, let me in on the joke." you really wanted to know and Walter calmed down "Well, your scientist husband encountered a floating hat at the crime scene and automatically thought of ghosts." Walter said now it was your turn to laugh, hand quickly going to cover your mouth "Are you serious?" you asked and Walter nodded "The team don't believe him that the hat was floating but I do but because of the reasons you mentioned." you shook your head not believing it "They're going to have a field day with this one." you chuckled "He should be back in my lab, wanna go with me?" Walter asked with a mischievous glint in his eyes and you immediately nodded in agreement.

        <p class="story">
            You both reached out the lab now and looked in seeing Ryan leaned over the desk top inspecting the hat so you and Walter looked at each other and quietly snickered before deciding to sneak up on him and just give him a little scare. Walter did the scaring because you couldn't control yourself with laughter, after Ryan released a tiny screamed you tried your best to keep your laughs muffled so Ryan gave Walter a hard look as he was grinning away "What are you, eight years old?" Ryan asked looking up to him then Walter pointed towards you making Ryan look back "It was her idea." the moment his eyes landed on you your hand went up into a defensive position "I'm seven." you joked and that caused Walter to grow weak in laughter making you join and Ryan was not amused "What is wrong with you guys?"  Ryan asked looking between you two as you entered going to stand next to Walter "Look man, that hat seems to be really messing with you." Walter commented gesturing to the hat "Ghost aren't real babe." you added and Ryan sighed before leaning back over interfering with the hat "Come on, I know it sounds crazy but I know what I saw. I saw this hat floating, it was really floating." Ryan said truthfully towards you two "We believe you." Walter told him "You guys keep busting my chops but I know I'm not crazy, the hat was floating, it was up in the air." Ryan said so you sighed leaning over to face "Babe, we said we believe you." you honestly said before Walter nodded in agreement and took up the hat "You guys do?" Ryan asked hopeful as you both stood up now following Walter as he explained his past experience of 'ghost' "But the thing is, there's always a logical explanation." he added at the end "Yes there is." Ryan said sounding more and more hopeful. "So, with the help of Heather's idea, let's figure it out." Walter said making you grin.
        </p>
        <p class="story">
            You had to head back to your lab but Ryan stayed with Walter to see the explanation "When I asked Heather if she saw a floating hat, what would her thoughts be." Walter started as he placed the hat in a chamber and Ryan looked on "She didn’t say a ghost did she?" Ryan asked hoping he wasn't the only crazy one and Walter chuckled with a shake of his head "She said there was probably an air flow or gas, which got me to thinking." he said closing the chamber door before setting up the gas "You ready?" he asked looking at Ryan "Yeah." Ryan said keeping his eyes on the hat "Watch and learn, and maybe you'll become smart like your wife." Walter commented before turning on the gas. Watching the hat closely, Ryan saw it start to levitate "What!" Ryan said in disbelief leaning closer before laughing "How did you do that?" Ryan asked totally amazed "When Heather mentioned the gas, I tried to think of which kind of gas was denser than air." Walter started before explaining more and Ryan finally understand "Don't tell Heather that she was right about this while I believed in a ghost." Ryan said and Walter laughed "You know I can't do that buddy, she deserves the credit for this." Ryan sighed and nodded "And I'm supposed to be the CSI." he commented "Maybe she should get the CSI Wolfe title." Walter joked making Ryan grin proudly with a shake of his head before they continue discussing the case.

        <p class="story">
            It was near the end of your shift when you walking in the hallway when you heard Walter call for you "Heather!" he called out making you turn to see that he was in his lab, he gestured you over with a grin. "I know this look, what are you up to?" you asked getting closer "Let's prank Ryan." Walter suggested and your grin matched his "Say less." you agreed before he got to telling you his plan.
        </p>
        <p class="story">
            "Are you sure he's going to pick it up?" Walter asked as he placed the hat as bait and you nodded "I know my husband, he's going to bite the bait." you said and just then your phone rang "Hey hun." you answered "Hey babe where are you?" Ryan asked on the other end "In the Chem lab with Walter, discussing something." you lied as Walter listened on grinning "Okay, I'll meet you there." Ryan said before hanging up "Did he buy it?" Walter asked and you nodded "He's coming." "Okay, let's quickly get upstairs." Walter suggested as you both scurried off to wait for Ryan. It wasn't long before you two spotted him about to enter the lab "Here he comes." you said so Walter could get ready. As planned, Ryan spotted the hat on the desk and that was the bait and if you knew Ryan, he would pick it up remembering what happened earlier, so you both remained quiet and looked on. Ryan reached out his hand to pick up the hat so you tapped Walter arm as he tugged a string that was connected to a tube next to the hat causing it to float and at the same time you released a ghost sound startling Ryan and he immediately knew who was pranking him "It's not funny Walter." Ryan said with a sigh making Walter laugh before looking up and then he spotted you too "Not you too babe." he said and you just shrugged with a grin before high fiving Walter "It's not everyday you get to prank a co-worker." you said and Walter nodded in agreement "Not funny guys." Ryan said completely done with you two before leaving and you and Walter just couldn't help yourselves at how funny it actually was.

        <p class="story">
            Ryan was quiet on the ride home after all the jokes you pulled on him today, so entering through the door with shoes and bags discarded, you hugged Ryan from behind "Are you mad at me?" you asked and he shook his head but you weren't accepting that "I can't hear you." you said and Ryan sighed "No baby, I'm not mad." he said not convincing you, so you jumped up on his back clinging on "Then I'll cling on till you tell me the truth." you said causing Ryan to smile, he honestly was never mad or annoyed at you, he was actually proud because you figured it out and happy that you were laughing and enjoying yourself, even though it was at his suspense "I mean it, I'm not mad." Ryan said as he walked over to the sofa with you still clung to his back, so before you could as again he tossed you off onto the sofa before moving to hover over you, trapping you "Seeing you laugh was beautiful, seeing you enjoy yourself was amazing, so it was hard to get annoyed or mad at you and also I was proud that you figured it out while I thought of ghosts." his last statement almost made you laugh but you controlled yourself and Ryan raised a brow at that "But, I think you should still be punished for pranking me." your face entered a state of shock at that "Put it was the opposite you said, what happened to the praise?" you asked and Ryan brought a hand to your hip "It went out the door the moment I remembered the dress you were wearing." Ryan said giving you a kiss to lips before making his way downwards "And just like that, I'm to be punished." Ryan hummed in response in your neck before leaning back up, placing his face over yours "Just like that." he with a peck before sitting up leaving you confused "What is happening?" you asked before pulled up you "The sofa is too small for what I want to do to you." Ryan stated and before you could ask any more questions, Ryan had to lifted and tossed over his shoulder, heading for the bedroom.

            "You know I never heard the term jiggalo before." you commented as you were sitting on top the counter while Ryan was making dinner "Never?" Ryan asked looking to you and you shook your head "So what do Bajans call male prostitutes then?" Ryan asked curious "I don't think there's a special name for them because for some reason I never thought we had any." you said with a chuckle "Well, you never know." Ryan said with a pointed finger, and he was right, you never know "But the woman though, that was dating him, yikes." you said and Ryan chuckled "Why yikes?" he asked "Why not yikes, why would you date someone that sleeps around for a living?" you questioned and Ryan thought about it "I mean, just the thought of you sleeping with someone pisses me off." Ryan said truthfully "Exactly, so why would she do that to herself, knowing how much customers he receives." you stated "Well, she did kill him in the end because she got jealous." that made you sigh "And they always result to violence first before breaking things off." you shook your head and Ryan chuckled "Says the woman that would kill her nemesis the first legal chance she gets." you gasped at that "This is different. He's truly wicked." you said started to get heated just at the thought of him and Ryan instantly regret it, so pausing what he was doing, he came over and stood between your legs, hands resting on your thighs "I was wrong for bringing him up." Ryan said before leaning forward to give you a kiss, the one that makes you forget "Better?" he asked leaning away and you nodded with a smile "Better." you told him he gave a wink before going back to what he was doing "Could you get the plates beautiful." Ryan instructed so you hoped off the counter doing as told.
