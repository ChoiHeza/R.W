        You had to go into the lab in the late morning so you decided to get
        ahead of the laundry because it was starting to build up. "Hey, I
        thought we were going to do that this weekend?" Ryan asked as he entered
        the laundry room seeing you working "Yeah but I figured it would be best
        to get ahead of it because you never know how the weekend is going to
        look for us." you told him as you continued to load the washer "Do you
        need any help?" "Yeah, can you bring me all the towels from the
        bathroom?" Ryan nodded before turning to leave.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        You released a whistle as you entered the bedroom catching Ryan off
        guard and he chuckled immediately knowing the reason for your actions "I
        look that good?" Ryan asked watching your movements as you made your way
        over to him "You look that good." you replied with several nods making
        Ryan laugh "Well thank you." he beamed taking hold of your waist as you
        stood in front of him. You couldn't help yourself and just leaned up to
        plant a kiss on his lips with a satisfied hum. "It's going to be that
        kind of day?" Ryan queried with a raised brow while looking down at you
        "I have self control okay." you retorted stepping out of his arms "Of
        course of course." Ryan grinned sarcastically and you just rolled your
        eyes at his comment.

        Ryan and Walter were in the warehouse lab looking over the items that
        came with the victim when he fell from the sky "Oooh, take a look at
        this." Ryan voiced while he was inspecting the helmet under the
        magnifying glass "Little bits of brain here." he discovered showing
        Walter before turning back to the other articles before him. Now it was
        Walter's turn for his discovery "The holes in this guys t-shirt makes it
        look like he went to a poison concert." Walter commented making Ryan
        chuckle lightly. "So Walter, when are you and I going up?" Ryan joked
        "Up, up where?" Walter asked pausing turning to look at Ryan making him
        halt as well "Up in an airplane. When we jump out of an airplane
        together." that made Walter turn back "Noo noo noo." Walter started in
        protest "No?" Ryan asked making Walter look back to him "The parachute
        was made for when the plane is crashing. You see, jumping out of a good
        one is just stupid." That made Ryan look at him in disbelief "Walter,
        you're such a baby." he said with a shake of his head "Why don't you ask
        Heather to go with you?" Walter questioned making Ryan release a sigh
        "She would say the exact same thing you said." "See, because she gets
        it." Ryan paused once again looking towards Walter "You know statically
        it's actually pretty safe." he declared "Let's ask Kevin how safe it is.
        Kevin! Kev-, that's right, Kevin's dead." Walter stated trying to prove
        his point "Walter too soon. To- too soon." Ryan commented with a shake
        of his head and they both focused back on looking for evidence.

        Ryan and Natalia were the lab after finding out that the victim had
        multiple children because he was a sperm donor. You were just walking by
        when you spot them "Hey guys." you greeted entering and they both
        greeted you back "Hey babe, just got in?" Ryan asked as you gave his arm
        a tap before going to stand beside Natalia "Nah, about an hour now. So
        what are you guys looking at?" Natalia filled you in on the case so far
        before they got started "So I spoke to Dr. Crono as the fertility clinic
        and he said this is the website that Cameron used, it's a sibling
        registry." Ryan described, displaying the website on screen "Oh yeah,
        I've heard of those. The clinics set them up so that the kids of the
        donor could find each other." Natalia voiced "Wow, I've never heard of
        that before." you stated "Well, they don't use the donor's name, they
        use a number and here's Kevins'." Ryan voiced before displaying it on
        screen "4-0-3-8-5" he called it out while running it through a search on
        the site "Can you imagine not knowing how many kids you have running
        around out there." you expressed after thinking about it "They're not
        his kids. They're not his responsibility." Ryan stated making both you
        and Natalia looked towards him with a shocked expression "Oh, spoken
        like a true dude." Natalia said making Ryan laugh and you just shook
        your head at him with a smile "How could you say that?" "That's the
        point. That's why he signed away his rights, so he wouldn't have to take
        responsibility." Ryan defended "Legally yeah legally." Natalia protested
        back "But there's a higher law at work here." she added making an idea
        came to you "Okay if the kids don't show up that fine, but what if your
        kid shows up at your door. How can you walk away from your own flesh and
        blood?" you asked Ryan as he came closer to you guys standing beside you
        now "If the kid had my nose, I'll be able to." Ryan replied making you
        both laugh "Well, I think it's cute." you voiced giving his nose a tap
        making Natalia smile at you both before you all turned back to the
        screen "What's 103?" Ryan asked seeing the number on screen "Uh, that's
        how many kids Kevin has." Natalia answered making both you and Ryan's
        eyes go wide "He had 103 kids? No way" you said completely amazed
        "That's 103 suspects." Ryan said. You three were in utter shock. Natalia
        said something in Spanish before Ryan made his own comment "The boys can
        swim huh." you smacked his arm with a smile making Ryan chuckle at you.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Hey." Ryan greeted as he entered your lab "Hey, how did it go with the
        wife?" you asked Ryan as he came next to you "Um, she exhibited a roller
        coaster of emotions but in the end, she handled it really well." Ryan
        commented with a smile "And the one hundred and three kids didn't upset
        her?" you asked and Ryan shook his head "She's happy about that, because
        she sees it as a part of her husband still out there in the world." Ryan
        said making you chuckle "Kind of weird but okay. I'm glad she took it
        well." you said before turning back to your screen "You know, it got me
        thinking. . It doesn't sound so bad to have a piece of yourself out
        there in the world." Ryan said making you whip your head around "Wait,
        are you thinking about donating sperm?" you asked super confused and
        Ryan shook his head laughing "No, I was referring to us having children.
        I know we are still indecisive but after talking to the wife and the joy
        she had at the end didn't make having children sound so bad." you smiled
        at that "So I'm guessing that we'll be revisiting this topic again?" you
        asked and Ryan tilted his head side to side "Maybe, but let's see how
        the day goes first, because it might change based on the case." Ryan
        replied making you chuckle "I understand."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "14!" Ryan exclaimed, "There's no way she gave birth to 14 children and
        all for other people, damn." you said as you were folding the laundry
        from this morning and Ryan was putting them away "Would you do that?"
        "Do what, give birth to fourteen children?" you asked looking up at him
        and a smiled with a shake of his head "No, the having children for
        someone else? Being a surrogate?" you thought for a moment at the
        question before giving your reply "Well I guess it would have to depend
        on the person or maybe the situation." "Really?" Ryan was somewhat
        surprised at your response and you nodded. "Yeah, but for right now, I
        would like my own kids. Ones I can keep." you said with a hopeful look
        towards Ryan making him chuckle "Is this your trying to persuade me into
        having kids?" Ryan asked with a raised brow and you nodded deciding to
        be true with your intentions "Well, I did had a lot of thought about it
        today, and…" he paused leaving you in suspense "And…?" you really wanted
        to know, so he stopped what he was doing and came over to you "I think
        we should have them. A little version of you and me." Ryan said taking
        hold of your waist as you halted your task "Are you sure?" you asked
        with concern because you know how Ryan's mind has been lately, in and
        out of indecisiveness when it came to having kids." so with a rub to
        your hips and waist Ryan replied "I'm definitely sure this time. I would
        be crazy to not have children with you." you grinned at that "So we're
        definitely doing this then?" Ryan nodded rapidly making you very happy
        that you jumped into his arms catching him off guard as he fell back
        unto the bed "Easy there." Ryan said chuckling at your behaviour "Sorry,
        but let's just forget the clothes." you suggested and Ryan immediately
        caught on "Right now?" he asked and you nodded "What the hell." Ryan
        said before attaching his lips to yours in a smile.
