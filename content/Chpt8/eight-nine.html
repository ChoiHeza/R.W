        "I don't think I'm going to be able to wear dresses as often anymore."
        you said going through the closet looking for your outfit for the day.
        "And why is that?" Ryan asked as he was doing the same "Because I wear a
        gun and badge now and they kind of don't work with dresses." you said
        giving him a quick look before turning back to the closet and a huge
        grin appeared on Ryan's face, that you practically heard, making you
        look back towards him "What's with the grin Ryan?" you asked with a
        smile "Just you." he replied but you raised your brow at that "Okay
        then." you said before going back looking for an outfit.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "I can't get over how amazing you look." Walter commented entering the
        locker room, finding you and Ryan there "Hey…" Ryan protested towards
        him making Walter raised his hands in surrender "Not like that Wolfe, I
        was referring to her being official official, with gun and badge."
        Walter said to avoid any confusions towards Ryan making you chuckle "We
        know what you meant, Ryan was just being Ryan." you told him, before
        giving Ryan a look and he shrugged "I didn't. I just thought he was
        hitting on you." Ryan stated making you both laugh "Well, I apologize if
        I came off that way, won't happen again." Walter assured and Ryan nodded
        "Thank you." you just smiled and shook your head at that. Right after
        that, Walter got a call excusing himself and Ryan closed his locker
        turning towards you "But Walter's not wrong though, you really do look
        amazing. I just can't help but fall in love with you each time I see
        you." Ryan said truthfully making his way over to you "But you see this
        look all the time, with the rest of the team. They all wear gun and
        badge." you said but he stopped in front you now, taking your hands in
        his "Yeah, but none of them are you, and it's just something about you
        wearing them that makes me go through so much emotions." Ryan said
        making you giggle "Like what for example?" you asked curious "Well for
        starters, I feel proud and happy for you at how successful you are, then
        admiration follows, then it gets personal." Ryan said clearing his
        throat at the end making you laugh "You mean, you get perverted." you
        said making Ryan shush you and quickly looking around before replying
        "It's not my fault that I find you super-hot like this and it's a major
        turn on. I'm simply your husband, sue me." Ryan commented with a smile
        making you shake your head before leaning forward "Welcome to my world."
        you said pecking his lips before turning to leave "Nah, you definitely
        look way sexier than I ever could." Ryan said following you making you
        laugh "Let's not start, because we'll be at this all day." you commented
        as you both left the locker room together.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        You were in your lab currently working on a different case, when you
        heard Ryan enter with a sigh "I know that sigh, what's wrong hun?" you
        asked not even looking back because you knew it was him "Did you hear
        about the case we're working on, the men that were released?" he asked
        coming next to you, so you paused and looked at him to reply "I did, and
        I think it's complete bs, no way is that fair and the justice system is
        completely flawed." you started before going on a rant on how you felt
        about the situation but Ryan had to calm you down because you were
        getting to heated "You know we'll get them right?" he asked halting your
        spews so you sighed "I really hope so, because we haven't been able to
        catch you know who." you said with a raised brow at the end and Ryan
        gave you a puzzled looked "Esteban." you whispered and Ryan's features
        entered a state of realization "We'll get him, we just need solid
        evidence, but these guys, we're for sure going to get them today." Ryan
        said confidently and you believed that because you know how capable the
        team is so you smiled at that "Okay CSI Wolfe, I'll hold you to that."
        you said making him chuckle "Good, but I also came in here for you to
        check out something." Ryan said before explaining to you.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "One of them were killed?" you asked Natalia as she was updating you
        about the case while you both were walking in the hallway towards your
        lab "Yeah, found stabbed in a bathroom." she said "Damn, the irony." she
        nodded at that "But oddly it doesn’t make me feel bad." she commented
        looking down at you "You shouldn't, because we know they're responsible
        for that boy's death years ago, so I'm with you on that one." you said
        and she offered you a smile as you both entered your lab spotting Ryan
        there "Hey hun." you greeted alerting him of both your presence "Hey
        babe, I have some news that may appease that twisted heart of yours."
        Ryan said as you and Natalia walked over to him "That one of the men
        were killed?" you asked making Ryan halt what he was doing to look at
        you with a surprised looked "Wait, how do you know?" he asked before
        looking towards Natalia "You told her?" he asked her and she nodded
        "That's what we were talking about before coming here." she stated and
        Ryan sulked "But I wanted to be the one to share the good news." Ryan
        said making both you and Natalia chuckle "And you call me the twisted
        one." you said before you guys left his side and headed to your
        computer.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        Natalia now left your lab after she came to update you about the case,
        because you told her to keep you posted and at that same time Ryan
        entered "Hey babe." Ryan greeted making you give him a quick look "Hey,
        I'm just finishing up here, so we'll be able to leave soon." you told
        him as he came to stand next to you "That's what I came to see you
        about, I got a call out for another case, so you'll have to go on home
        without me." you looked up at him now "Okay baby, do you know how long
        it'll take?" you asked and he shook his head "No clue, but I'll keep you
        updated." you nodded "Want me to leave the car for you or do you want me
        to come and pick you up?" Ryan chuckled at that "I would never ask you
        to leave the car, I'll call when I'm finished." you chuckled back with a
        nod "I gotta go, get home safely." Ryan said with a kiss to your
        forehead "Same to you please." you smiled up at him which he returned
        "Of course." with a tap to your lower back and he was gone.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        You were currently home cooking dinner while on a video call with your
        mom waiting for Ryan to call. "Was it a tough case today?" your mom
        asked "Not necessarily for me, the topic was grim but I was busy working
        on several other cases besides the main one." you told her "And did you
        go into the field today?" you shook your head "Not today." your mom
        continued to ask different questions about your day and you answered
        them all. "When is Ryan coming home?" "I should get a call from him any
        minute now to come and pick him up because he messaged me earlier
        letting me know that it's a short case." you told and paused what you
        were doing to check your phone to make sure you didn’t miss a call from
        him. "Anything?" your mom asked as she watched you "Nothing, something
        probably came up." you commented and just then you heard the front door
        open. "Hey hun." followed Ryan's voice "He's home, I thought he was
        going to call." you told her and it didn't take long before Ryan came
        into view with a smile on his face at seeing you "Hey babe, I thought
        you were going to call, how did you get home?" you asked as he
        approached you "Delko had to pass our direction so he offered to give me
        a ride." he said taking hold of your waist but you had to stop him "Mom
        is on video call." you whispered with a gesture of your head towards
        your laptop, making him look and his hands quickly left your body "Hey
        mom, how are you doing?" he said leaving you and heading over to your
        laptop making you chuckle and shake your head. He took up your laptop
        and headed towards the living room engaging in deep conversation with
        your mom so you decided to finish up dinner.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        You just finished the moment Ryan entered the kitchen "Mom said she'll
        talk to another day." Ryan said coming over making you laugh "And you
        wouldn't believe I was the one on the video call with her." you said
        making Ryan grin as he took hold of your waist once again with a shrug
        "What can I say, I'm clearly her favourite." he said making you shake
        your head "You're lucky it's cute when you guys talk together. Now, help
        me get the plates, dinner is ready." you told him "Yes mam, but first."
        Ryan said before leaning down to place a sweet kiss on your lips
        "Imagine if you didn’t stop me and I kissed you in front of your
        mother." Ryan stated making you laugh "But you could kiss me in front of
        our co-workers and your parents?" you questioned and Ryan nodded "Of
        course, that's different." just as you were about to ask he raised his
        hands "Don't ask, it's weird I know." he stated so you nodded before
        stepping out of his arms.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "I feel like I barely saw Calleigh today." you voiced as you both were
        eating dinner "She was with the victim that was sexually assaulted."
        Ryan answered and that made you look up at him confused "Who was?" "You
        remember the girl that was their fan girl and help them get free?" you
        nodded "It was her." you gasped at that "Are you serious?" Ryan nodded
        "Damn." was all you manage to say, because truly you didn't know how to
        reply to that "Don't want to come across as mean huh?" Ryan asked and
        you tried your best to hide your smile "You know me so well don't you.
        Well, it's wrong that it happened to her, and I'm sorry that it did."
        you said keeping it short and Ryan chuckled "Want to say more don't
        you." and you shrugged but Ryan knows what you want to say "Don't worry
        baby, I understand you. But yeah, it does suck it happened to her, no
        matter the circumstances she didn't deserve it." Ryan said seriously and
        you nodded "I agree." you said offering a sad smile "So, how was the
        second case?" you asked wanting to change the topic.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        Both you and Ryan were in bed already for the night and watching tv just
        waiting till sleep come. "You know what's something I've realized
        lately?" Ryan asked taking your attention from the tv "What is that?"
        "You're capturing a lot of the male attention lately." you raised your
        brow at that "What do you mean? Are you referring to Walter from this
        morning?" you asked and Ryan shook his head "Outside of him, men at the
        station. I think it's the new look." you sat up now to look down at Ryan
        "What kind of look is it, like one of hate or lust?" "Lust, why would it
        be hate?" Ryan was curious as to why you thought that "Because I'm a
        black female that received a higher position within the station, and I
        wasn't working there as long as some of them." you told him truthfully
        what you thought and Ryan thought for a moment because the idea never
        crossed his mind "Is that even possible?" Ryan asked and you nodded "It
        is, and I've seen it happened, but not to me personally." you said and
        Ryan stared at you unsure of what to say "Well, the looks didn't look
        like any of hate. Just guys forgetting that you're married." Ryan said
        and you chuckled at that "I've never even noticed." you said truthfully
        because you only have eyes for him "Really?" Ryan asked and you nodded
        "Really, because I only have eyes for one guy." you said with a wink
        making Ryan smile wide before leaning to peck your lips.
