        You woke up and was surprised to see yourself still on the sofa so
        immediately you knew that Ryan didn't came home last night. Panic
        quickly settled in and you reached for your phone calling him but kept
        getting his voice mail. You got up quickly searched all over the house
        and even the garage and neither him or his car was there. So you decided
        to call Natalia and when she saw your name flash across her phone, she
        immediately knew something is wrong because you've never called her this
        early "Hey Heather, what's wrong?" Natalia asked worried "Hey, have you
        seen or heard from Ryan, he didn't come home last night?" you asked
        hoping she can settle your heart "No, when I saw him last was last
        night, he said that he's worried about you so he's going home. Are you
        sure he's not there?" she asked again "No, and his car isn't either."
        you told her and she got to thinking "Maybe he came in last night and
        left early this morning?" she asked trying to find an answer "He didn't
        because I woke up on the couch, and he never leaves me sleeping on the
        couch so that's how I know he never came home." you were really starting
        to worry "Okay, I'm going to come over and we're going to find him,
        okay?" "Thank you." with that you both hung up and Natalia wasted no
        time in getting to you.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        The moment you let her in, you engulfed her in a hug "I feel like
        something bad has happened, I can feel it." you said truthfully as you
        guys pulled apart and entered the house "Well, I've been thinking and I
        have an idea as to where he could be." Natalia said making you alert
        "Where?" you asked wanted to know and she sighed "Well, the conversation
        got heated last night and you know how I feel about Samantha." she
        started and you nodded for her to continue "Well after everything that
        happened with Josh, I think he probably lied about going home and
        instead visited Josh." as you listened to her speak, it made sense
        because that's something he would do "Okay, then why hasn't he come
        home?" you asked trying to understand and Natalia shrugged "I don't
        know, let me see if I can find him." she said ready to make a call but
        her phone rang instead "CSI Boa Vista." she answered and you looked on
        watching her facial expressions entered a state of shock "Are you sure?"
        she asked and then sighed after getting the reply "Okay, I'll be there
        shortly." she said before hanging up and looking back to you "We know
        where he is." she started to say not sure how to continue "What, what
        happened?" you asked and she lowered her head before looking back at you
        "He's been arrested, for the murder of Josh." your eyes instantly widen
        but when it registered what she said you felt sick "I'm gonna throw up."
        you quickly said before holding your mouth and running off to the
        bathroom and Natalia made sure to follow behind you. As you knelt over
        the toilet, she held your hair and rubbed your back "It's going to be
        okay." she said consoling you and after it all felt like it was out of
        your system, you reached up and flushed the toilet before sitting back
        on your heels and Natalia looked on "If I knew this would of made you
        sick, I wouldn't have told you." she said seeing your face go pale and
        you just couldn't believe the situation that was currently unfolding
        before you that you started to chuckle "Life is funny isn't it." you
        commented making Natalia confused and just when she was about to ask
        what you meant you spoke first "I'm pregnant." the moment those words
        left your lips, the room went quiet as she was processing the
        information. She started off in mumbles before finding the right words
        "Since when did you know?" she asked looking at you now "Yesterday
        morning." you replied then she caught on "That's why you weren't feeling
        well yesterday?" she asked and you nodded "Does Ryan know?" you shook
        your head before replying "You're the first one to know. I was planning
        on telling him last night." you said with a sigh, and then gestured for
        her to help you up. Going to the sink you washed out your mouth "I uh,
        don't know what to say, congratulations for starters but, Ryan.." she
        said not knowing how to finish but you understood "Let's keep this
        between us for now?" you asked and she nodded "Of course, and Ryan, we
        both know he's innocent, he would never do something like that." Natalia
        reassured and you nodded "I know." you said with a smile. "Don't worry,
        I'm going to go help clear his name, you can trust me on that." she said
        taking your hands in hers "I know you will." you gave her a smile which
        she returned before pulling you into a hug "I'm going to be an aunt."
        she commented making you chuckle.

      <p class="story">
        Natalia arrived at the lab and was currently standing next to Samantha
        looking on as Ryan was being processed, and it hurt her heart seeing it,
        knowing the truth about you and the state you must be currently in also
        the fact that Ryan has no idea that he's going to be a dad. "I'm sorry
        about your boyfriend." Natalia said to Sam but she remained quiet, only
        giving Nat a look "I hate to say it but, Ryan was only there because of
        you." Natalia stated taking her eyes from Ryan for a second "I tried to
        stop him, this whole thing just spiraled out of control." Sam said, eyes
        not once leaving Ryan "That's for sure." Natalia added "But I also find
        it odd that the one person who could testify that you were the one who
        messed up the evidence is dead." Natalia mentioned giving Sam a hard
        look but she had nothing to say so Natalia looked back to Ryan and saw
        enough because she made a promise to you "I can't stand here and watch
        my friend get treated like a perp. This is bs." she stated before
        walking away but Sam remained.

      <p class="story">
        The team worked the case and worked hard to clear Ryan's name, because
        they knew he didn't do it and that's just want they did. You were on the
        sofa when Natalia called you, giving you the good news that Ryan's name
        was clear and he was on his way home. So you sat and patiently waited
        for Ryan to walk through the door.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        Pulling up to the house, Ryan took a while before he got out the vehicle
        because he's wondering how the heck he's going to explain this one to
        you so with a sigh, he got out and slowly walked to the front door,
        pausing before unlocking the door and entering. While inside, you heard
        the door unlocked so you quickly got up and ran over, just in time to
        jump into his arms as he came through the door, and Ryan squeezed you
        feeling relieved that he's home with you "I'm so sorry Heather, I'm so
        so so sorry." Ryan said into your neck but you just wanted to feel him
        knowing that he's okay. After that shared moment, you got down and you
        guys pulled apart finally seeing how bruised his face was so raising
        your hand, you gently caressed his cheek making Ryan lean into it before
        running your hand down to his chest, and giving him a shove "What the
        hell Ryan?" you said anger immediately entering your voice "What were
        you thinking, I know you love playing hero but that guy is bigger than
        you and it could have been you there on Tom's table instead of Josh."
        you said letting it all out "I get it, you were trying to help but that
        was stupid, going to his home and confronting him and you lied last
        night telling the team that you were going home to your sick wife
        because you're worried. Bullshit Ryan." you said jabbing your finger
        into his chest "Guess what, you never came home to your sick wife, that
        tried to wait up for you but got tired and then to wake up finding out
        that you never came home. The fear and panic I entered. Like really what
        were you thinking?" you said catching a breath but Ryan kept his head
        lowered "I wasn't thinking clearly, because I got mad and acted upon
        it." he said looking up to meet your angry gaze "Which you know was very
        stupid, so what was the plan, confront him, have it go completely
        civilized then come home to me?" you asked wanted to know "I didn't
        think that far ahead." Ryan said making you laugh "He didn't think that
        far ahead, he didn't think that his actions were going to have
        consequences, he didn't think that he was going to get framed for a
        murder, he didn't think about coming home to his wife, he just didn't
        think." you said with venom laced in your voice and Ryan knows it's bad
        when you're speaking like this to him, he knows he's messed up, royally
        messed up "I'm sorry, but my intentions were never to fight him, I was
        just going to talk to him." that made you give him a look "Really now
        Ryan? You think two men as yourselves were going to have a civilized
        conversation without fists being thrown, don't lie to yourself babe."
        you said making him sigh "I woke up and found myself on the sofa this
        morning." you started making Ryan look at you with a pained, hurtful
        expression "And that's when I knew you didn't come last night, and after
        not reaching you, I called Natalia and I had to hear from her, what
        stupidness you went and did." you said with a pointed finger and his
        head lowered once again "'My husband arrested for murder', that thought
        just kept playing in my mind, along with 'and I'm carrying his child'"
        that statement made him instantly raise his head to meet your stare
        "You're.. You're… " Ryan said pointing towards your stomach trying to
        make a sentence in his stunned state "Pregnant? Yes, yes I am." you
        stated and Ryan couldn't believe it because he could see how he really
        messed up "When did you find out?" he asked wanting to come closer but
        decided to keep his distance "Yesterday morning and I was planning on
        telling you last night, but we know how that went." you stated so Ryan
        immediately dropped to his knees in front of you, head bowed "Heather, I
        am so sorry, I was wrong for what I did, I should of thought it through
        clearly, and came home to you instead of confronting Josh, and I know
        you're mad at me but I never meant to hurt you." Ryan said truthfully
        and you know he meant all of it, and you knew he was just acting on
        instinct because he's a good guy like that, so sighing to approached him
        and rested your hands on his shoulders "Look at me." you instructed so
        he looked up, begging for forgiveness and apologizing with his eyes "I
        know how you are Ryan, you always do what's right, or want justice
        served and I could get behind that but I need you alive as well to be
        here with me and .." you said reaching for his arm, to rest his hand on
        your lower stomach "our child growing inside of me." you said smiling
        down at him making his eyes water and the sight brought tears to your
        eyes so Ryan looked away from you and turned towards your stomach "I'm
        sorry little one, for worrying you both and I promise going forward, no
        more impulse behaviors that's going to hurt any of us." Ryan said making
        you smile wider before placing a kiss there, then he looked up at you
        before raising to his feet. "And I'm sorry to you as well, the same
        thing goes." he said truthfully, looking down at you and you nodded with
        a smile "Okay Mr. Wolfe." you said before you guys shared a kissed and
        Ryan was about to lift and spin you with joy but you had to halt him
        "I'm going to throw up if you do that." you warned making him chuckle
        "Sorry, but I'm just so happy." he said with a grin permanently etched
        onto his face making you grin as well. "I can’t believe I almost messed
        up something amazing." Ryan commented, wrapping his arms around your
        waist "Mistakes were made, but you know better now." you said and he
        nodded rapidly "I do, and I'll make it up to you both, I promise." you
        smiled at that "I know you will." you said before giving his lips a peck
        and pulling back to look at your stomach "You heard that, he promised."
        you said with a chuckle and Ryan joined.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        After you guys died down from the excitement, you both talked and were
        so happy that you're finally pregnant because it was something you guys
        were planning for "Can't you change the appointment to tomorrow?" Ryan
        asked as he pulled up outside the doctor's office "I wish, this is her
        only last available time before she goes on holiday, and she's been
        helping us through the process so I don't really want to see anyone
        else." you told Ryan and he sighed "Okay, just tell me everything she
        says, and leave out no details. I'll just have to make sure to attend
        all future appointments with you." you smiled at that "You got it. You
        will know everything that went on." you said raising a hand for him to
        take and he interlaced his fingers with your before giving your hand a
        kiss at the back of it "I'm so stupid." Ryan said with a sigh, looking
        deep within your eyes so you reached across and took hold of his cheek
        "We're past that now, we can't change what happened. Let's just be
        thankful, the worse didn't happen." you reassured and he gave you a nod
        so with that you both shared a smile and a kiss "Okay, it's time." you
        said with a nervous chuckle and Ryan smiled getting out, coming around
        to open your door for you "I wish I could be here with you." he said
        after you were out, standing in front of him, so you took hold of both
        his hands "It's going to be okay, although I'm a little nervous but I
        know that everything is going to be okay." you said with a grin and Ryan
        reached up to push a piece of hair behind your ears "Imagine how I feel
        at that fact I'm not going to be there with you." he said with a chuckle
        which you both shared "We got this." you said with a firm nod before
        leaning up to peck his lips "Sure you're okay taking a cab?" you nodded
        "I'll be fine, plus you'll be busy and I wouldn't want to trouble you."
        Ryan shook his head "No, you wouldn't be, you're my wife and now the
        mother of my unborn child, so you could never trouble me." he reply made
        you grin.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        When Ryan got work, Natalia happened to be in the locker room when he
        entered "Hey." he greeted, alerting her of his presence "Hey. You gave
        us quit a scare this morning." you replied and Ryan released a light
        chuckle to that "If you're going to scold me too, Heather covered it."
        Ryan said making Natalia laughed and she shook her head before closing
        her locker and coming closer "Well, I won't scold you, I would just say
        that I really mad when I saw the state Heather was in this morning."
        that made Ryan pause what he was doing to look towards her "So you
        know.." Ryan started before quickly looking around making sure they're
        the only ones there "that Heather is pregnant?" he asked and she nodded
        "Yeah, because she was scared Ryan. I don't think it would be easy
        hearing that your husband got arrested for murder. The news literally
        made her sick." Ryan sighed heavily and he doesn't know how to correct
        this one, to make it up to you "I'm still thinking how to make it up to
        her this time but I am thankful that you were there for her, because of
        my stupidity." "I'll always be there for her, and I think going forward
        just, be less quick to action but if you want to do some kind of grand
        gesture, I can help you out with that." she said offering him a smile
        "Thank you. I will take you up on that offer" he returned it.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        You just got back to the station and told Ryan to meet you in the car
        park by the car, because you all have designated parking "Hey." you
        heard Ryan making you turn to look at him "Hey." you said with a grin
        "How comes we're not meeting in the locker room?" asked as he was in
        front of you now "Because I wanted a little more privacy to talk to you
        and I'm not ready for the others to know anything yet, besides Natalia.
        I'll wait to after this day is over so she can share the news." Ryan
        agreed with you "So how did it go?" you gave him a nervous smile "Well,
        everything is perfect but.." you said halting making Ryan entered a
        state of worry so reached into your handbag and pulled our an envelope,
        giving it to him "What's this?" he asked looking the brown package in
        his hand curiously "Open it." you said with a grin starting to appear on
        your face, so wasting no time, Ryan reached inside and pulled out the
        black and white image "It's the sonogram?" he asked giving you a quick
        look which you replied with a rapid nod "I don't have to show you
        because you know how to read them." he nodded then inspected it
        carefully but it brows furrowed and he tilted his head, then his
        features entered a state of surprise, with widen eyes "We're having
        twin?!" he whispered yelled looking towards you and you once again
        nodded rapidly, confirming Ryan of what he saw and he looked back at the
        image "No way." his features entered a state of euphoria before he took
        you into his arms "Twins, Heather, we're having twins." he said over the
        moon, before pulling away to take hold of your face "Yes babe, we're
        having twins." with that, he instantly captured your lips feeling
        complete joy.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "I can't stop smiling." Ryan said as you both walked towards the locker
        room "I can see that." you said shaking your head matching his smile "I
        was so close to ruining it all." he said with a sigh looking down at you
        and you both entered the room but before you could reply, you guys
        caught sight of Sam kicking the lockers, so you both shared a look
        before going over slowly, you on either side of the bench "Hey Sam." you
        spoke first, alerting her of both your presence "Great, you guys are
        here to lecture me too?" she asked leaving you confused but Ryan knew
        what she was talking about "I'm just about the last guy around here that
        should be doing that." Ryan told her, at this point you were just
        listening in because you have no clue as to what is going on. Just that
        moment your phone rang, letting you know you were needed so you turned
        to Ryan and gave him a look and he nodded, letting you know that he's
        got it covered. So you slowly made your exit, going up to the lab.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        While in your lab, Ryan came rushing in "Hey babe, have you heard from
        Sam?" Ryan asked and you shook your head "The last I saw her was when we
        were in the locker room." Ryan sighed at that "What's going on?" you
        asked starting to worry "We're not getting ahold of her, so we think
        something happened." Ryan said so you immediately turned back to your
        computer "Let me see if I could track her." Ryan looked on as you got to
        work but it wasn't looking good on your end either "Anything?" you shook
        your head "I'm not even getting a signal." you commented "Like it's
        off?" he asked and you shook your head "No, if a phone is off I can
        still track it but it's like it doesn't exist anymore." you told him and
        you guys shared a look before Ryan came up with another idea "Try
        O'Malley." you nodded and it wasn't long before you got a result "It's
        moving fast." you stated "She could be with him, thanks beautiful." Ryan
        said with a quick tap to your lower back before heading off towards H's
        direction.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        She was in fact with him and managed to get into an accident, so
        allowing Dave to take over at work, you went to be with her at the
        hospital. You waited through her surgery and Ryan called to check in to
        see that she was okay, and once she was admitted to a ward, you stayed
        by her side till she woke up, which wasn't long. "Looks like I won't be
        able to make it to the ceremony." Sam said and you shook your head
        "Let's not think about that right now." you said holding her hand "Even
        if we have to push back the date just for you to make it, we will." you
        said with a smile and she smiled at that "Really?" she asked and you
        nodded "Really, we want you there, you are a part of the team after
        all." you told her and she squeezed your hand at that, tears threatening
        to spill and it seemed like she wanted to tell you something but before
        she had a chance to, came a knock at the door pulling both your
        attention towards the sound "Hey." Ryan greeted and you were about to
        give him a smile but the look on his face made you not. You could tell
        that something was wrong, and that his smile was fake "Everything okay?"
        you asked and Ryan made a gesture with his head for you to come to him
        so you looked towards Sam "I'll be right back okay." you said with a
        smile and squeezed her hand so she nodded. Letting go, you got up and
        went over to Ryan before he placed a hand on your lower back leading you
        outside "Hey, what's wrong?" you asked immediately with concern and Ryan
        didn't know how to tell you what he just found out, so with a sigh, he
        took your hands in his making you worry more "Is something wrong with
        Samantha? Did the doctor say something?" you asked and Ryan just
        released a sad smile, because you were so caring towards her, not
        knowing what she did. "Oh baby." Ryan said bringing a hand up to push a
        piece of hair behind your ears "What I'm about to tell you, I need you
        to remain calm and quiet, okay?" Ryan asked and you nodded slowly
        "Promise me babe." "I promise." you reassured so he sighed before
        speaking "While processing Samantha's shoes, I found a piece of glass in
        the sole and it matched the glass that was near Josh's body " Ryan
        started and you tried to understand "So that means she was there?" you
        asked to clarify and Ryan nodded so you got more to thinking "But in
        order for the glass to get there, it would had to be after you were
        knocked out and while he was still alive." you said your mind going into
        hyper mode then it all clicked and your face fell, and that's when Ryan
        realized you figured it out "She, she.." you tried to say but was at a
        loss for words but Ryan understood so he nodded "She framed you for the
        murder?" you asked again just to be sure and Ryan nodded, your emotions
        went from hurt, to betrayal then to anger and Ryan immediately knew you
        had one thought on your mind, going after her, so he held your arms
        holding you back "Let me go Ryan." you said fighting against his hold
        but he tried his best to keep you there while at the same time not
        hurting you, so he gestured to someone behind you "Take her." he said
        and just then you felt someone else take hold of you "What the hell
        Ryan?!" you said angry "No babe, you're going to go in there and do
        something you're going to regret, so please stay out here and think of
        the babies." Ryan commented so immediately you calmed down allowing the
        officer to hold you "Please keep an eye on her." Ryan told the officer
        sternly "Yes CSI Wolfe." he said firmly with a nod, hand not leaving
        your arm, so Ryan gave you one last look before disappearing into the
        room that Samantha was in.

        He slowly walked in and went and sat in the seat you were in, resting on
        the frame of her bed "Hi." he said with a heavy heart and small smile
        which she returned, there was a long paused and Ryan released a deep
        breathe before speaking "How are you feeling?" "Like I just drove off a
        bridge." Sam replied so Ryan looked back towards the door remembering
        you and chuckled at her reply. He took another long pause and deep
        breathe still not believing what's about to happen "Sam you were there."
        Ryan started making her look away, with tears welding up in her eyes "I
        pulled the shard of glass out of your shoe and it matches the wine
        bottle in Josh's apartment-" "Please stop" she interjected trying to cut
        him off but he ignored her and continued nonetheless "and the shard of
        glass I had in my hand." Ryan said getting angry now "Am I going to
        jail?" she asked, eyes on the verge of tears and Ryan didn't know how to
        respond "None of this would have happened if you just listened to me."
        you told him "I went there to talk to him." Ryan replied, starting to
        feel bad as she took a sharp breathe "What did you do?" he asked with a
        painful expression "You left me there." he said as the anger started to
        return "You left me and I've defended, Heather defended you. You had
        ever opportunity to tell us the truth." he said his best trying to
        remain calm "When I took those exams and I went through all that
        training, I saw myself as a cop, it was my real identity. Then there was
        a dead body, right in front of me and I put it there." you said looking
        off into the distance and Ryan just listened "I let you down, I'm sorry.
        I'm so sorry" Sam apologized and kept apologizing for what she did and
        Ryan was truly hurt because not only was it him effected by this but
        also you too "You know, you should really be apologizing to Heather and
        our unborn children, because of what you did, I was almost taken away
        from my family. And she was here with you, caring for you and you didn’t
        even had the decency to at least tell her, and currently she's right
        outside that door being held back because you've betrayed her and she's
        angry. So that makes me angry, how could you Sam, how?" Ryan was going
        through so many emotions and Sam was at a lost for word, because she
        knows there's no coming back from what she did, then she registered
        something he said "Unborn children?" she asked looking towards him and
        he nodded "Yeah, she's pregnant with twins." he stated and the tears
        fell from her eyes "I'm sorry." she said again knowing now that she
        almost caused Ryan to be taken away from you "I would usually say save
        it for Heather, but I don't want you ever seeing her again, or be near
        her. Because she was nothing but nice and caring to you, and always
        defended you no matter the situation, even when Natalia was against you
        or the team for that matter. And compared to what you did to her, makes
        you an evil person." Ryan was just speaking out of pure anger at this
        point "And you know what the funny thing is, if you came to her clean
        about what you did, she would of still stayed by your side and helped
        you through it, because that's the kind of person she is." Ryan said
        starting to stand now, because the sight of Samantha was starting to
        irritate him "And because of that, I hope you rot in jail." were Ryan's
        last words to her, before he left, not even sparing her a final glance.
        He got out the room to see the officer still there but he was alone and
        him sensing the question that was coming he answered right away "She
        went out to the gardens, she wanted fresh air." he nodded at that "She's
        all yours." Ryan told the officer, gesturing towards Samantha's room
        before he left, to look for you.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        You were currently on a bench sitting, because you got tired of the
        pacing and realized it wasn't worth it but you were still hurt.
        "Beautiful." came Ryan's voice as he spotted you coming closer "Hey."
        was all you managed to say as he sat next to you, taking your hand in
        his "How did it go?" you asked curious and he smile "Good, I gave her a
        piece of my mind." you chuckled at that before leaning back to look at
        the sky "Didn't see that coming." Ryan commented joining you and you
        shook your head "Not one bit. What a day huh?" you said with sigh,
        looking towards Ryan and he looked at you as well before smiling and
        bringing his hand down to rest on your stomach "My stupid events may
        have led to this, that I regret but these two right here, makes it all
        so much better." Ryan said with a wide smile "No, his death has nothing
        to do with you. You went there to defend her but she who chose to kill
        him, you didn't tell her to kill him. She did that on your own." you
        reassured him because you know Ryan feels somewhat responsible for what
        happened if he doesn't admit it but you gotta let him know, that that
        was all her "But that's all in our past now and we have a wonderful
        future ahead of us." you told him with a comforting smile while resting
        your hand on top of his.

      <p class="story">
        It was the end you all shift, and boy was it a very long day, so you all
        decided to go to one of your favourite wind down drinking spots to
        release it all "I never saw that coming." Ryan commented as the team was
        talking about the Samantha situation "None of us did Wolfe." Walter
        added but Natalia made a sound catching everyone's attention "Well, I'm
        not surprised, we all know I didn’t like or trust her." Natalia said
        making you laugh "And I should of listened to you." you said clinking
        your glass with hers "Yes, but it's showed you had a kind heart towards
        her, no matter what." that made everyone smile "It makes the memories
        from the night shift kind of sour now huh?" Walter asked and you nodded
        "Definitely." "And I guess I'll have to find a new partner to play
        tennis with on the weekends." Tom commented making you entered a state
        of remembrance "Oh yeah, I forgot you guys did that together." Tom
        nodded at your reply just then Delko returned to the table "Was that
        Calleigh?" Ryan asked and he nodded with a grin "She got the kids." he
        said making everyone cheer "Now that calls for a celebration, drinks on
        me." Eric called out and going around making sure everyone was getting
        their personal favourite, then he reached you "Heather, you are not
        saying no because you missed out last and you gotta make it up to us."
        he said with a pointed finger then you laughed raising your hand in
        surrender "Sorry, I think I'm going to stick with my cream soda." you
        said and they all booed you making you laugh "Hey, why are you guys
        trying to make my wife drunk." Ryan commented and now it was Walter's
        turn to plead "Come on Heather, I miss my drinking buddy. It's been like
        what, a month since we've last drank together." Walter stated counting
        in his head and the others started to agree with him so you and Ryan
        shared a look but Natalia was hiding a smile behind her glass "Well…"
        you started and they all looked at you but Tom was the one to finish it
        "You're pregnant." that made you gasp, well all of you in fact as you
        all looked towards him "Wait, why are you gasping, you knew that." Ryan
        asked you "Well yeah, but I didn't expect him to know." you commented
        "Well I'm a doctor and I noticed the signs." then they all looked
        towards you "So, is it true, you guys are pregnant?" Walter asked and
        you and Ryan shared a look before confirming with the team that it is in
        fact true and they all cheered pulling you both in a hug "No way, we're
        gonna have a little Wolf." Walter said with a huge grin "I call
        Godfather." Eric said making Walter whip his head towards him "You just
        can't call Godfather, because I want it." Walter argued you back and the
        behaviour made you laugh "You can be Godfathers." you told him and they
        gave you a look "Well, in America, a child can only legally have one God
        parent." Walter said and you nodded "I know, I guess it's a good thing
        that we're having two children then." you said and there was another
        round of gasps and shocked expressions "What?!" said Natalia now because
        she only knew that you were pregnant, so you pulled out the sonogram for
        they to see "Marvelous, you're having twins." Tom commented after
        looking at the image "I can't believe it, you guys really are Wolves."
        Walter commented making you all laugh "What's going on?" H asked finally
        joining you guys and the others shared the news before you and Ryan had
        a chance to, and it turned out that they all had bets going on amongst
        them for when you guys might get pregnant, even including Horatio. That
        evening you guys celebrated forgetting what transpired throughout the
        day.

      <p class="story">
        "I'm going to be a dad." Ryan commented making you hold up your head as
        you both were in the bath across from each other "Yes you are." you
        smiled at that "I know your mom is going to freak out when you tell her
        the news, because according to her, you've been taking forever to have
        children." you commented making Ryan laugh "Wait till she finds out that
        it's two instead of one." you laughed at that "That poor woman, you're
        going to give her a heart attack" Ryan chuckled before leaning forward
        to pull you towards him "I am so blessed." Ryan said as you were on his
        lap now, arms around your waist as yours were on his shoulders "The love
        of my life, my gorgeous wife is pregnant with my children, and I
        couldn't be filled with more joy, pure joy." Ryan stated looking at you
        with heart eyes making your heart go soft "I love you Heather Wolfe,
        with every fiber of my being." that made you bring your hands up to
        capture his face "And I love you Ryan Wolfe, way more than you'll ever
        know." you said making him grin "We both know I love you more, way way
        more." Ryan said squeezing your waist and not giving you any chance to
        compete, he captured your lips with his, just pouring all of his love
        for you into that kiss making you both feel complete and contented
        inside.
