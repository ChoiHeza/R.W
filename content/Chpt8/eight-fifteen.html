        "Ryan Jason Wolfe." Those words left your mouth the moment you entered
        the bedroom seeing Ryan and he just laughed "I've been married to you
        long enough to know that you're full naming me because of how I'm
        dressed and how are you going to be able to function today with me
        looking like this." He said with a raised brow and that made you do a
        face towards him. "You just know everything don't you." "When it comes
        to my wife, pretty much, yeah." "I hate you." You said walking away "We
        both know you don't." Ryan shouted as you left the room and you just
        rolled your eyes at him with a smile
      </p>

        It was Natalia's off day but she had to come in to sign some papers, so
        while passing by the lab and spotting Ryan and Sam, she decided to stop
        in and say 'Hey' but spotted something that made her stop in her tracks.
        Looking on from outside, she spotted Sam and Ryan pretty close as Sam
        was brushing something from Ryans' cheek, so forgetting about heading in
        there, she made a beeline towards your lab. You were just entering when
        you saw Natalia heading your direction "Natalia, I thought it was your
        day off, what are you doing here?" you asked with a wide smile but it
        quickly left when you saw the look on her face "What's wrong?" you asked
        worried "I just saw something that I'm not sure how to process it." with
        that you both entered the lab and towards your computer "Talk to me
        Natalia, what did you see?" you asked curious and she released a sigh
        before telling you "I just saw Ryan and Samantha sharing a moment." you
        gave her a very puzzled look "Elaborate please." and she did just that
        "Wait, Sam was making a move on Ryan?" you asked trying to understand
        and Natalia nodded "And what did Ryan do?" you asked and she shrugged "I
        didn't stay long enough to see in case I was spotted." you nodded at
        that not sure how to process what you heard "What are you going to do?"
        she asked so you looked at your screen before looking back to her "I'll
        ask him about it when I get the chance." "But just keep in mind that
        it's Ryan, he wouldn’t do anything behind your back that you wouldn't
        like." Natalia reassured so you gave her a smile at that "I know, I
        trust him."

        You have been super busy after Natalia told you about the incident that
        happened with Ryan that you haven't gotten a chance to approach him
        about it but just that moment, Ryan entered your lab. "Beautiful, are
        you busy?" "A little bit. What do you need?" You took a pause to look at
        him "There's something that I need to talk to you about." Ryan said with
        a worried look. You have an idea as to what it maybe but you gave him
        your undivided attention nonetheless, so you nodded for him to continue.
        "I think Samantha made a move on me earlier." You raised your brow at
        him in question "You think?" Ryan slowly nodded "Explain what made you
        think that?" You turned to him now fully ready to hear what he has to
        say "We were dusting for prints on some document and I got the dust on
        my face, and when she told me about it I tried to clean it off but she
        stepped in and cleaned it off for me giving a weird kind of vibe." You
        processed what he just told you and was thinking exactly how reply back
        "Umm, okay." "Are you mad?" Ryan asked quickly after looking at your
        facial expression so you shook your head to dismiss his thoughts "No, of
        course not. Well I should start by saying that Natalia came and told me
        about it but I got so caught up with work that I get a chance to talk to
        you about it but the fact that you came to me about makes me feel good.
        But I'm not sure how to feel about the situation though. And you're
        absolutely sure she made a move?" Ryan nodded and you just sighed "Maybe
        I could be overthinking it but I want you to know that the moment that
        happened, I stepped away from her as to not give her the wrong idea."
        You smiled at that "Don't worry Ryan, I trust you." You said taking hold
        of his forearm. Immediately, it felt like a heavy weight was lifted off
        his chest as he released a breath making you chuckle.

        "How did it go?" Came Natalia's voice as she entered your lab "What are
        you still doing here?" "They ended up needing me for the day to work on
        something." You nodded as she came next to you "Ryan actually got to me
        before I got to him." "Really?!" You nodded before continuing "He told
        me that he think Samantha made a move on him and he explained the
        situation." "What did he do?" "He stepped away the moment he sensed a
        vibe." "That's good. So are you going to talk to her?" Natalia asked
        "You think I should?" You questioned making Natalia immediately nod her
        head "Of course, that's your husband! You’ve got to let her know that
        he's taken." She said making you laugh "But I mean like, she already
        knows that." You said with a raised brow and Natalia returned it right
        back "But does she though, or she wouldn't be hitting on your man." That
        made you laugh more "I think you just want drama and want me to not like
        her as well." You said knowingly and Natalia shrugged with a smile
        "Maybe." You just shook your head and laugh
