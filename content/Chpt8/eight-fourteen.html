        "Still not pregnant yet." you said with a sigh as you exited the
        bathroom "That's not a bad thing." Ryan replied as you approached him "I
        know, but we're really looking forward to it." Ryan nodded "But let's be
        patient with it. It's going to happen on it's own time." Ryan said in
        reassurance soothing your arms but you still sulked nonetheless "I know
        I know. Maybe I'm the problem." Ryan was quick to shut that down "Don't
        talk like that Heather, you're perfectly fine, we went to the doctors
        last week remember, and they said everything was fine, it's just going
        to take time." "But what if they lied?" You questioned as doubt started
        to enter so Ryan took hold of your face "Beautiful, everything is going
        to be fine, okay?" You sulked some more making Ryan repeat his statement
        "Repeat after me, 'Everything is going to be fine.'" with a sigh you did
        as told "Everything is going to be fine." "Good, now you got to believe
        it so that it would work." "Yes sir." You said with a nod and a smile
        "That's my girl, and no more taking a test every morning, it's just
        going to make you more anxious." You nodded in agreement "I'll stop."
        "Thank you." He replied with a kiss to your forehead. "Better?" Ryan
        asked looking down at you so you nodded looking up at him with a smile
        "Better."

        "Hey." Sam called towards you as she entered the break room "Hey Samo,
        if you came for coffee the machine is broke." "All three?" You nodded in
        reply turning back to your phone "I guess it's a good thing I just came
        for water." She said while retrieving a bottle from the fridge before
        coming to sit next to you at the table "Did you hear about Ryan?" She
        asked with a mischievous glint in her eyes "How terrified he was of the
        horse?" She shook her head "When we were out scoping the scene, there
        was a riding crop hidden in the grass and Ryan got startled, thinking it
        was a snake" Sam chuckled making you laugh "Today just wasn't his day
        huh." "Gonna tease him about it?" You nodded "Of course." You both
        laughed at that.

      <p class="story">
        "I'm coming to you now before anyone gets to you." Were the first words
        that left Ryan's mouth as he entered your lab "Let me guess, about you
        being scared of a horse?" You asked with a smile looking towards him and
        his face entered a state of shock "How did you hear about that so fast?"
        "Babe, you know word spreads fast amongst these walls. But Calleigh told
        me about it." You said with a chuckle at the end and Ryan sighed "One of
        these days, I'll get to you first." That made you laugh "Sure.... So is
        that all you came here for?" You asked and Ryan shook his head, "Not
        necessarily. Mom has been trying to get ahold of you." "She has?" You
        asked as you went to pull out your phone realizing it wasn't in your
        pocket "Wait, where's my phone?" You entered a state of panic "I thought
        it was on me." You suddenly started to looking around the lab "No wonder
        my morning has been pretty quiet." "Maybe you left it in your bag?" Ryan
        asked and you thought for a moment retracing your steps. "Wait, I was in
        the break room this morning. I think I left it in there. I'll have to
        check when I'm finished here." "Don't hurt your head, I'll check for
        you." You smiled at that "Aren't you a doll." "The best, be right back."
        With that Ryan left the lab to retrieve your phone for you. After a
        while Ryan returned "Was it there?" "Yes mam." Ryan replied presenting
        the phone to you and a sigh of relief left you "Now let's find out what
        it was your mother wanted." Taking the phone you checked to see that you
        received several messages from her and upon reading them you started to
        sulk "What is it?" Ryan asked as he saw your features turned down so you
        turned the phone to show him and he sighed reading the messages "I'll
        call her." Ryan said before giving your forehead a kiss then proceeds to
        leave your lab while pulling out his phone. His mom wanted to know if
        you were pregnant yet so that upset you knowing how this morning went.

        "I see your husband is an expert with horses now." Sam said entering
        your lab with a drive that you requested "Really? Do tell." You chuckled
        retrieving the drive from her and entering it into the computer to check
        out the encrypted data "We had to head back to the stables to look for
        some evidence and we encountered the horse again and this time was
        prepared. He learnt from Calliegh that you can just give them a mint and
        they'll be calm so that's what he did." Hearing that made you grin
        because you know deep inside Ryan was ecstatic about pulling off
        something like that "Look at him being a horse whisperer." You both
        laughed at that before turning to the screen.

        It was the end of your shift and you were in the locker room getting
        your belongings when Walter entered "Hey, Hez, heading off already?" You
        closed your locker with bag in hand before turning to him "Yeah, I gotta
        stop by the office before heading so decided to just leave an hour
        early. I heard you guys got called out for a another case." With that
        Walter released a sigh "Tell me about it, but this seems like a simple
        one, thank goodness." "That's what they all say in the beginning." You
        chuckled walking past Walter and giving his arm a tap on the way out
        "Hey, don't jinx it." You did a sealing of your lips gesture "Tomorrow,
        big bear." You said with a wave and you were gone but you didn't get far
        because you ended up bumping into Ryan "Hey, I thought you left
        already." "I just a little minor thing to finish up." Ryan nodded "Okay,
        see you at home then. I'll message when I'm leaving." "Be safe." With
        that you guys shared a quick kiss before parting ways.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Are you okay?" Ryan asked as you came to sit in bed beside him "Yeah.
        Why wouldn't I be?" You asked turning to him "Well, I'm just making sure
        because you were pretty down today?" "Oh, well, I had a very good talk
        with my husband this morning and throughout the day, where he reassured
        me that it's going to happen eventually and when it does, it will be
        just at the right time." Ryan grinned at that "He sounds very wise." You
        just shook your head at him moving to lay down "He has his moments."
        "I'll take it." That made you laugh "But at least you're well." You
        nodded "I really am, thanks to you." Ryan laid now and you both turned
        to face each other "Just doing my husband duties." You smiled at that
        before you guys kissed each other goodnight.
