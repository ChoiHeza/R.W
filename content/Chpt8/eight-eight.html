        Natalia just got into a pretty heated argument with Samantha and need
        someone to vent to and help her cool off, so she headed towards your
        direction because she knows you're a very fair person. "Heather Wolfe, I
        am in need of your company." Natalia as she entered your lab "Whoa,
        sounds serious." you commented looking towards her "Kind of, able to
        take a break?" she asked and you nodded "Of course, let's take a walk."
        you said pausing what you're doing and lead her out the lab "So what's
        up?" you asked her and she got into explaining what just happened
        between her and Sam, leaving no details out "Can I input?" you asked
        slightly raising your hand and she nodded "Of course." "Well, I can see
        where you're coming from, because we all want to catch Esteban so bad
        and to have that evidence ruined hurts, but we all make mistakes, as bad
        as this one maybe. Remember, we were all there, where she is now." you
        spoke and Natalia listened and she released a sigh "It sucks when you're
        right you know." she said with a smile making you chuckle "I'm just
        being fair." you stated "I know and thank you, for that."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        You just finished walking Natalia back to her lab and was on your way
        back to yours when you heard Ryan called out for you "Hey beautiful,
        wait up." you halted and waited till he was next to you "Did you hear
        the new girl messed up Esteban's blood sample?" Ryan asked as you guys
        walked together "Yeah, Natalia was just telling me about it." you
        replied giving him a look "But it's not definite that it's blood,
        because according to what I saw from the surveillance logs, he didn't
        have enough time to slip away." you told him what you thought of the
        situation so far "We do know that he's a killer, he confessed to
        Horatio." Ryan stated "That's true but that doesn't mean he's
        responsible for today's victim." and it hurt you saying that sentence "I
        think that it's possible that we're looking at tribute killer." you said
        as you both entered your lab "A tribute killer?" Ryan asked so you got
        to work on the computer to explain what you meant "Ever since Esteban
        came on the scene, I've been monitoring web activity about the Miami
        Taunter." you said pulling it up and Ryan looked towards you "Is that
        what it was that you've been doing at home?" Ryan asked and you nodded
        "And you would not believe how many fans this guy has." you said turning
        back to the screen to pull up a website you found "Here's a website
        where people can post their extreme views on the Miami Taunter." you
        said as Ryan looked on "Any good candidates for our possible tribute
        killer?" he asked so you pulled up a post you found, reading it to him
        "Well he's got a real way with words." Ryan commented after you were
        finished so you found another one "'What a rush, knowing that you're the
        last person that sees alive', close but not creepy enough." you said as
        you went through some of them looking for the next possible victim but
        one of them caught your eye "'Her eyes are a vast ocean, one look and I
        drown'" you read out and Ryan looked closer "Okay, that's officially
        creepy." he commented and you agreed "There's an attachment." you stated
        spotting a file below, so you clicked it pulling up the photo on the big
        screen "That's a photo of the crime scene." Ryan said as a photo of the
        female victim was shown "Babe, check it out, this was taken before you
        guys got there because she's got both earrings." you pointed out
        noticing the difference from the crime scene photos they've taken "Who
        is this 'TRUEEVIL 188'?" Ryan asked referring to the person that made
        the post, so you clicked the name, displaying the profile "I don't know,
        but I bet we could get the service provider to give us an IP address."
        you told him as you both looked towards each other "Okay, you do that
        while a get ahold of Calleigh to let her know of the update and text me
        the address when you get it." Ryan said pulling out his phone "You got
        it." you said with a wink before turning back to the screen "Thanks
        babe." he said with a smile and tap to your lower back before leaving,
        phone to his ear.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        While working your phone rang and you say it was Ryan, so smiling you
        answered "This is Wolfe." that made Ryan chuckle "Cute babe, I need a
        favour." "Sure, what is it?" you asked "Do you still have the car keys?"
        "Yeah, why?" you paused what you were doing and focused on the call "I
        need to change my shoes, I stepped in dog shit." Ryan said making your
        face go up in disgust "You poor thing, meet me in the locker room." "Got
        it." Ryan said before you both hung up "Be right back Dave." you said
        turning to him and he nodded before you left.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Here you go." you said taking the keys from your pocket and handing
        them to him "Was it when you visited the dog pound?" you asked and he
        nodded "Yeah, the guy was our 'TRUEEVIL 188' and he was a runner." Ryan
        said with a sigh because he didn't had enough time to look where he was
        running "Please tell me you aren't putting those shoes in the car just
        like that?" you asked and Ryan shook his head "Of course not babe, I'll
        put them in a bag first to wash off later at home." you nodded "Good,
        I'm heading back up." you said before turning to leave "Thanks babe." he
        said after you and you waved a hand.

        You were walking back to your lab after meeting Ryan, when a very quick
        Walter sped past you "Walter!" you called out making him alert so he
        turn around to meet your gaze "Where are you off to in such a hurry?"
        you asked going closer to him "To stop Samantha from doing something
        she's going to regret, come on." he said before quickly turning and
        continuing his speedy walk making you take longer strides to catch up.
        As you guys reached the reception area you both spotted Sam, making your
        way towards her with you still completely confused as to what was going
        on "Hey Sam, I've been looking all over for you." Walter said as he
        approached "Where are you going?" he asked "First stop, unemployment
        office." she replied after signing a sheet now you were catching on to
        what was happening "You're quitting?!" you asked shocked and Walter took
        hold of her arm, pulling her to side making sure you're close behind
        "Yeah, Boa Vista pretty much ordered me to." she said as you three calm
        to a halt "All the more reason for you to stay." Walter told her "Look,
        you're a good CSI, I know it." Walter added and you nodded "You really
        are, I've seen you work." she released a huge sigh "Alright you guys,
        spare me the pep talk, she's right. I ruined evidence in a murder
        investigation, I mean, how am I supposed to look another officer in the
        eye again." she said feeling down "Mistakes are a part of the job Sam."
        you told her "Yeah, and you think everyone around here is perfect?"
        Walter added "They're not, and you quitting isn't going to get the
        taunter off the streets any faster." you stated and she really listened
        to you both "I guess that's true." she said finally agreeing with you
        guys "You just gotta find another way to get that evidence. Use your
        noggin." Walter told her making you smile and she got to thinking.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        Ryan and Walter went to the runners' van, after they had him in custody
        and upon opening the doors, they were hit with an awful smell "Whoa, it
        smells like someone died in here." Ryan commented waving a hand in front
        of his nose "You sure it's not your shoes?" Walter joked making Ryan
        release a fake chuckle "Ha ha, I changed them, so it's not me." "When?"
        Walter asked "When I got back to the station, I keep spare shoes in the
        car." Ryan commented as they started to look the contents of the van
        "Right you're OCD, a clean freak." Walter commented making Ryan laugh
        "It wasn't me this time, Heather is the one that keeps an extra pair for
        me in the car because I chase perps so much." Ryan stated and Walter
        smiled at that "We get it, you guys are a happily married couple."
        Walter said with fake jealously "Hey, you asked and I answered." Ryan
        said before spotting something important "I think I got something here."
        he said making Walter look towards him.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "This is really sad if you think about it." you commented as you guys
        were listening to the voicemail from the victim parents' home "It is. No
        one wants to receive a call like this about their child." Ryan said
        before replaying the audio and at that moment, Calleigh entered "Hey
        guys, the victim's mother confirmed, it's the same voice she heard on
        the phone." she said as she came to stand next to you guys "We can't
        rely on this as evidence. Chain of custody is all wrong." Ryan said
        looking at her "We can't ignore it either." she said so Ryan took a deep
        breath before you spoke "It feels like it's been tampered with." you
        said and Ryan nodded "Yeah, like we're getting set up." he added on in
        agreement "Maybe. Let's just proceed with caution." Calleigh said
        looking between you two "Okay, I'll run the voice through codas and
        it'll eliminate whatever artificial distortion there is." you said
        turning back to the screen getting to work and each time the voice
        sounded different "Well, that's not Esteban's voice, no surprise there."
        Ryan stated "It's not the dog pound guy either." Calleigh added "Then
        who's voice is it?" you asked before you all shared a look.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        The team got another suspect and he claimed to be the Miami Taunter so
        while Calleigh and Ryan were interrogating him, you were in the next
        room, listening in with a program to see if his voice matches that from
        the call. After hearing the man confess very vividly, Ryan asked the
        suspect to repeat the line that was said on the call recording before
        him and Calleigh left the room, coming over towards you "I'm working on
        the voice comparison now." you told them as they entered and went to
        stand by the window looking at the man "Well, he's gotta be the guy. He
        only knows things that the killer would know." Ryan said staring him
        down "But he gave it up like a script." Calleigh commented "And he
        threatened Vanessa." she added "You know, serial killer savor their
        kills, I don’t feel that this guys' got the stomach for it." Calleigh
        said making Ryan look towards her "No, literally." Ryan stated turning
        back to him shaking his head "What are we missing?" he asked in the open
        and just then the comparison was complete "Guys." you called out making
        them look towards you "We got a match." you said looking at them then
        towards the guy and they both sighed "I'm going to arrest him." Calleigh
        said "And I'm going to have Natalia check into his background." Ryan
        added because deep down, you all knew this was wrong.

      <p class="story">
        It was the end of your shift and although you were bummed with how the
        day went, you were thankful to go home and just wind down from your day.
        As you were leaving your lab, your cell rang and you saw it was H. "Hey
        Lieutenant." you answered and did a silent prayer hoping he isn't asking
        you to work overtime "Meet me in the interrogation room by the
        elevators." "Yes sir." you said before hanging and sighed "I hope I'm
        not in trouble." you said to yourself before heading there. Upon
        approaching you spotted him from outside so with a steady breath you
        entered the room "You wanted to see me H." you said alerting him of your
        presence and he turned with a smile "With the program you created and
        brought to the lab along with your expertise, has made our jobs here
        more efficient and easier, and we are very lucky to have you here on the
        team with us." H said smiling growing before reaching his hand towards a
        box on the tablet pushing it towards you "For you." you going forward
        you reached for the box and opened it, a confused expression over took
        your face, within the box was a gun and badge "I don't understand?" you
        asked looking back up to him "I knew you secretly took the police exam
        and passed with flying colours, and that you're certified to carry a
        weapon and I've heard and saw that you're one of the best shooters in
        the department." the smile on your face grew "But I thought no one knew
        about those things." you said looking up him "I know everything that I
        need to know about my team." he said with a nod and smile "So these are
        mine?" you asked and he nodded so you reached into the box and took out
        the badge bringing it to your face to inspect it "You sure about this?"
        you asked him and he chuckled "Very, you would an important addition to
        the team." he said as you met eyes and you grin "Thank you Lt. Caine."
        he nodded "Put it on." he said so you did as instructed and it's a good
        thing you wore a skirt today, so you clipped it onto the left side of
        your waistband.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        Meanwhile on the outside, the rest of the team were looking on and you
        were completely unaware of their presence. "Why didn't you tell us that
        Heather took the police exam and passed beautifully?" Natalia asked Ryan
        "I had no idea. We always talked about her becoming a forensic scientist
        but she didn't feel like going back to school and was happy with the job
        she had." Ryan said truthfully "You had no clue?" Eric asked and Ryan
        shook his head "None, but I'm very proud of her." Ryan said looking on
        with a smile permanently etched on his face "But according to H, she
        took it like a year and half ago, so I guess she didn't want to act on
        it." Calleigh said and that made the rest look at her "Really?!" Natalia
        asked and she nodded "So that means she's also been a police officer but
        unofficial?" Natalia asked and Calleigh nodded once again "Who would of
        thought." Eric commented as they all looked back to you as you placed
        the badge on your waist.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Don't forget your firearm." H said and you reached into the box taking
        it up along with the holster before placing them next to your badge and
        with everything attached you stood back up straight and looked towards
        him "How do I look?" you asked and H smiled wide "Official." then he
        reached out his hand towards you "Welcome to the police department and
        team CSI Wolfe." with that you took his hand with a smile feeling pretty
        amazing "Thank you Lt. Horatio Caine." after the shake he looked behind
        you shaking his head and did a wave of his hand signaling to come so you
        looked back and saw rest of the team were outside watching the whole
        thing with grins on their face. "How long were you guys standing there?"
        you asked as they all filed into the room "The whole time, we were just
        hiding around the corner waiting till you entered the room." Natalia
        said grinning wide "Guys, although she is already one of us, but we have
        to officially welcome her now because she has a new title." Eric
        started, coming over to stand beside you, hand resting on your shoulder
        "Let us welcome CSI Wolfe, to the team." he said with a grin making
        everyone cheer and clap and Ryan kept the most noise making you chuckle
        "Thank you guys." you could not stop smiling and they all came and
        hugged you, it was like a group hug kind of thing. "How do you feel?"
        Calleigh asked holding your hands "Still shocked but very happy." you
        said truthfully before looking towards Ryan and his smile just matched
        yours "Congrats beautiful." Ryan said coming over to give you your own
        personal hug "Thank you." you said laughing then he pulled away but
        leaving an arm around your waist "I guess that day we were joking about
        having two CSI Wolfes came to fruition." Walter committed making the
        team laugh "So how are we going to work that out?" Natalia asked and you
        and Ryan shared a look "I want Heather to keep the CSI Wolfe, but if
        we’re together, we can use our first names." Ryan said before looking
        back to the team "Are you sure, because CSI Wolfe is your thing, I don't
        mind being CSI Heather." you told him truthfully "I'm sure, you're
        keeping it." he said sternly to you before looking back to the team
        "She's keep it." he said making them laugh "So guys.." Walter said with
        a clap, alerting everyone "You know what this calls for, a celebration."
        he said making everyone cheer "You coming H?" you asked turning towards
        him and he nodded "Wouldn't miss it."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        You guys stayed out longer than expected so when you came in through the
        door, you were exhausted. Taking off your shoes and dropping your bags,
        you made a beeline for the sofa, dropping down onto it and Ryan chuckled
        at your behaviour "Don't fall asleep babe." he said coming over to you
        stooping down to meet you eye level and you groaned so he smiled before
        smacking your bum "Come on, let's take a shower." he said so you sighed
        before moving to sit up with a slouch "I'm tired." you said stating the
        obvious making Ryan laugh "We know this babe." so Ryan turned his back
        towards you "Hop on and I'll take you." he said so you grinned before
        getting on his back and when he made sure you were secured, he stood up,
        heading off to the bathroom.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        With clothes gone, Ryan mostly helping you, you both were sitting in the
        tub across from each other and Ryan had a permanent smile on his lips
        "What's up?" you asked curious about his expression "I'm just really
        proud of you, CSI Wolfe." he said making you grin "I'm sorry for not
        telling you that I took the exam. You weren't mad right?" you asked him
        and he shook his head "Of course not, I was over joyed." he said
        truthfully "But I'm curious though, as to why you took it?" he asked so
        you leaned your head back against the rim "I was just curious to see if
        I would pass it, plus don't mention this but I did it majorly for fun."
        you said with a chuckle and Ryan widened his eyes "For fun, and with
        those scores?" he asked and you nodded "It was honestly not that hard."
        you said with a shrug and Ryan was stunned "Wow, I'm truly impressed."
        Ryan said before leaning forward to take your hand to pull you towards
        him "Perfect scores and an amazing shot, you just love proving more and
        more that you're way out of my league." you giggled at that as Ryan's
        arms wounded around your waist, pulling you closer to him "But baby,
        you're married to me, so I don't think you are." you said and he shook
        his head "You are, trust me, but I'm very blessed to call you mine." you
        said with a grin not believing how lucky he is to have someone as
        amazing as you in his life and more importantly as his wife, the love of
        his life "I love you." you said smiling down at him as your arms wrapped
        around his shoulder "And I love you." he said returning the smile before
        both your lips connected.
