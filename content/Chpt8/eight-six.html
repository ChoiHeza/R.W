            You were currently in the mirror trying on a pair of cat ears, since it was Halloween, you wanted to try something different and put a little touch to your look for the holiday "No babe." Ryan commented as he entered the bedroom seeing you "What do you mean no?" you asked, looking at him in the mirror as he came over to you "No ears." you whined at that "Why not?" and he shrugged "Because," he just said not giving an explanation and you sighed removing the ears "Fine, I won't wear the ears." you said taking them off and tossing them to the dresser before starting to remove your dress as well. "What are you doing?" Ryan asked as he watched you "Changing my dress." you said as it fell off your body now, piling to the floor "Yeah, but why?" he asked, eyes never leaving your body "Because I had the dress planned around the ears, was going as a black cat." you commented going to the dresser looking for something different "But you still looked great none the less, you know it's one of my favourite dresses." Ryan commented and you nodded "I know that, that's why I took it off." you said before looking towards him "If I can't wear the ears, you don't get to enjoy me wearing the dress." you stated and gave him a look before turning back to the closet. Ryan sighed before shaking his head "Mad at me now?" he asked stopping short near you and you shook your head not sparing him a glance "Nope." you replied popping the p and Ryan sighed once more because he knew it was the opposite of what you said. "I'm sorry." Ryan said keeping his distance "No need to apologize, you did nothing wrong." you said finally finding a dress and pulling it out still not meeting Ryan's eyes. "How long are you going to stay mad at me?" Ryan asked "I'm not mad at you." you replied starting to put on the dress but Ryan got tired and halted you taking your arm making you finally look up at him "You keep saying that but your behaviour is telling me otherwise, so tell me what it is, cause I know it's not just the ears, is it from this morning?" Ryan asked trying to understand and you sighed "Ryan, it's nothing, just let it go." you said but Ryan refused to buy it "Babe, I've known you for almost ten years, and I know when you're lying to me." Ryan said now having his arms around your waist keeping you trapped "So your plan is to keep me trapped?" you asked with a raised brow and Ryan nodded "Of course, and we're going to talk this out." you sighed defeated "Can I at least put on clothes?" you asked cause you were still in your under garments and Ryan shook his head "No, I think you look quite pretty like this." Ryan said with a smirk and you had to try your best to not smile because you're mad at him "I hate you." you whispered and Ryan chuckled "I'm sure you do, now talk." leaving you no choice, you talked.

            "I'm sorry, and I shouldn't have lied to you about what I did, but I was just doing it to not cause you to worry, especially after what happened with the tornado." Ryan apologized "I get that babe, but we work together so I'm going to find out eventually and I think you would appreciate it, if I heard it from you first so you could avoid me being mad at you." you told him truthfully and Ryan chuckled "Yeah, you being mad at me is something I'm not a fan of." he said with a shake of his head and smiling down at you "Then stop making stupid decisions." you told him with a tilt of your head and a smack to his chest "Yes ma'am, now was that so hard?" Ryan asked smiling down at you "Well, I felt like I was one of your suspects." you replied and Ryan smirked "Well, for starters, none of the suspects are under dress." you scoffed at that "That's because you didn't allow me to put on anything." you commented "It wouldn't have made much sense if you did, they were going to come back off anyways." the moment those words left his lips you recognized it "Have you been reading my books?" you asked surprised and impressed "Maybe." he smirked "You have, because I recognized that line from 'Red Lights' when Christopher said it." that made Ryan smile wider, "So that means you know what's coming next." he said with a wink making you grin happily with a nod, so wasting no more time, Ryan lifted you up, wrapping your legs around his torso before heading for the bed

            The case you guys were working on fit perfectly with the holiday of today. As you were walking in the hall, you looked inside a lab and spotted Calleigh and Eric inside, so changing direction, you headed their way "Hey hey." you greeted making them look up at you and they both greeted you back "What are you guys working on?" you asked them going closer and Calleigh pointed to a piece of paper "Trying to figure out the language that this letter was written in." she answered then Eric remembered something "Wait a minute, Heather, you're a big fan of languages and you speak several, mind taking a look?" Eric asked and you nodded "Of course." you came closer and Calleigh turned the screen for you to see and immediately you recognized it and you chuckled "I honestly was not expecting to see this." you commented looking over the lines so Calleigh and Eric shared a look before looking back at you "You recognized it?" Eric asked and you nodded "Itâ€™s a made up language called 'Davi' for a vampire book series, 'Love's First Bite' by Marilyn Milner" you told them before explaining it "A vampire book?" Eric asked with a chuckle and you nodded "No judgement, but I actually don't like vampires or the trope because of the blood drinking but the story of this series is pretty interesting." you said with a chuckle "That I can understand, but I'll keep that in mind when I'm gifting you your next book." Calleigh said with a smile and Eric shook his head at you two "So Heather, can you tell us what's written here?" Eric asked and you turned back to the letter "Sure, I can try, might not be completely accurate." you said before reading the contents out of the letter out loud then translating the best you could. "Roughly translating, the person is praising the book and then something about drinking the blood of a version." you said face going up in disgust and they shared a look once more before turning to you "Are you sure?" Calleigh asked and you nodded "I guess whoever wrote this just became our lead suspect." Eric stated looking between you two "Thanks Heather." he said towards you "Anytime." you told the two before leaving.

            "Hey babe, did you manage to pull up the map of the island?" Ryan asked as he entered the lab coming over to you "Hey, almost, for some reason the aerial view for it was restricted." you said giving Ryan a quick glance "But your smart self-figured it out right?" you chuckled before looking at Ryan "Of course." you said with a wink "By the way, I heard that you were able to translate the letter found." Ryan said smiling wide and you nodded "Who would of thought me reading a vampire book, would of came in handy in a case." you said laughing at how silly it sounds "It is funny and even more so because you don't like vampire tropes." Ryan stated "I know right." just then the map fully loaded "And I just keep getting better." you commented referring to the map and both your attentions directed towards it "Want to take over?" you asked Ryan, resting a hand on his shoulders "You sure?" you nodded "I like seeing you work." you said with a wink making Ryan chuckle "Alright then." with that you both switched places. Ryan started surveying the land looking for any other structures or anything in general "What's that?" you asked pointing towards the screen as you spotted something and Ryan pulled it up "Looks like something, but I'm not sure what. Can this be 3d rendered?" Ryan asked "Nah, one of the downside of it being restricted." you told him before he zoomed out and continued searching around finding nothing else. Just then Tom entered "Mr. and Mrs. Wolfe, you guys are gonna wanna see this" he announced as he quickly walked over to you both "Actually I want to see this." Ryan said going back to the only other structure found on the map explaining something, while Tom then mentioned something about the victim and the two kept going back and forth but Ryan was clearly disregarding everything Tom was telling him "It has to be this structure." Ryan commented "That's where she was drained of her blood, just like in Marilyn's new book." Tom added "Yeah, I think that's where it happened." Ryan said completely ignoring Tom, then tapping your lower back before leaving in a haste. You and Tom shared a look, him stunned and you sighed with a shake of your head "I'm sorry Tom, Ryan can be, Ryan sometimes." you told him and Tom gave you a smile "You know you don't have to apologize for him, I'm accustom." Tom reassured but you sighed none the less "Well, I'm still sorry. Let me walk you back down." you said with a gestured of your head and Tom smiled with a shake of his head "You don't have to." he said starting to leave but you chuckled tagging along either way "If I don't how are we supposed to talk about the new book?" you questioned and he grinned towards you "Then let's walk, shall we." he said and you happily joined him.

            Near the end of your shift, you and Frank decided to meet in a interrogating room near the elevator to make an exchange "Heather." he said greeting you with a nod and you did one right back "Frank, you got it?" you asked with a raised brow and he showed you the manuscript of the last book "And you got mine?" you nodded showing him your copy of the first book "Not a word to anyone about this." Frank said pointedly and you nodded "Lips are sealed." and with that you both shared a smile before exchanging the books and taking your seats getting comfortable to dive into your respective books.

            The rest of the team meet by the reception desk to make plans for dinner "Whoop whoop, no call outs, who's up for dinner?" Walter asked loudly with joy and everyone answered in agreement "Hey, have you guys seen Heather, I'm not getting through to her?" Ryan asked as he hung up after your phone went to voicemail again "Last I saw her, she was in her lab." Natalia said and Ryan shook his head "She's not there." just as Ryan was about to call you again, Walter spotted you along with Frank "Wait, look up there." Walter pointed making everyone's eyes follow and they all laughed "Would you look at that, never would of pegged Heather and Frank being reading buddies." Eric commented making the team laugh "Hey, Heather, Frank!" Walter called out alerting you two "You guys coming to dinner?" he asked and only you looked up seeing that the team was outside in the hall "Sure." you called back before turning to Frank "You coming?" you asked and he shook his head to engrossed in the book "You guys can go on without me." he replied so you nodded "Okay, hold this for me till I get back." you said resting the manuscript on the table before him and he nodded "Sure." with that you left the room meeting the rest "Did you rope in Frank?" Natalia asked as you were with them now and you chuckled shaking your head "Not me, he's just looking over some case files" you said with a chuckle and shake of your head "So where are we going?" Calleigh asked and just then her, Ryan and Walter's phone pinged, alerting them of another case "Guys, bad news, we got a call out." Ryan said reading the message "Homicide, witness report that the murderer was.." Ryan paused before looking up "A werewolf." Ryan said making you, Eric and Natalia laugh and Calleigh sighed with a roll of her eyes "I hate Halloween." "Good luck with that." Natalia said with a grin while Eric waved beginning to leave with a grin himself "Let's go guys." he said referring to you and Natalia. "You guys go ahead, I'll catch up." you told them before quickly turning going towards Ryan "Going to go home after dinner or come back to the lab?" Ryan asked "I'm not sure, depends on how long your case is going to be." Ryan nodded "Okay, I'll keep you updated." he said with wink before you guys started to separate "Be safe." you told him "Always beautiful." he replied and you guys went your way.

            Ryan called to let you know that it was going to be a short case, so you decided to come back after dinner and went into the interrogation room after retrieving back the manuscript from Frank, and that's where you remained reading until Ryan was finished. You heard a knock on the glass from outside making you look up "Hey, finished?" you asked the moment you saw it was him and he nodded "Ready to go?" he asked and you stood up looking at the manuscript and Ryan read your thoughts "I already got a copy of it for you." Ryan said making you look up with a grin "Really?" you asked and Ryan nodded matching your grin. "I love you." you said quickly approaching him and giving him a kiss after making sure the coast was clear "Anything for you my love." Ryan said with a grin before you guys headed down "Dinner was good?" Ryan asked as you both walked side by side. "Excellent but it sucks you guys weren't there." you said truthfully "But I did buy something for you." you added and Ryan chuckled "Thanks babe and I love you" he said placing a kiss to your temple.
