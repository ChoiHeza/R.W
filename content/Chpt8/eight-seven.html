            "You know…" Ryan started as he took hold of your waist making you look up at him "I was thinking, we could go out this evening." Ryan added as you brought your hands up to rest on his chest "I'm afraid I'll have to take a rain check on whatever that maybe." Ryan raised his brow in question "You've made other plans?" you chuckled at that "Not really, the derby girls invited me for a fun game this evening." Ryan's ear perked up at that and he grinned "Forget my plans, can I come?" Ryan asked making you laugh so you nodded "Of course." Ryan eyes lit up at that with a grin and you just shook your head at his behaviour "So weird you are." you commented stepping out of his arms "Nope, it's just a major turn on whenever I watch you play." he said truthfully "It's as you put it, 'The scariest and sexiest thing you've ever seen'" you said with chuckle and Ryan shrugged "What can I saw, I'm just merely a man." Ryan commented and all you could do was shake your head at him.

            "Small bear, hello hello." greeted Walter as he entered your lab "Hey big bear, what's up?" you asked giving him a quick glance as he came over to you "I come bearing good news, a Miss Samantha Owens has joined us in the sun." Walter said so you immediately whipped your hear around towards him and grin "No, way, Sammo is on the day shift now?" you asked and Walter nodded "She's one of us. I just came from by her." you both were smiling wide now, because along with Walter, Samantha used to be with you guys always on the night shift, you guys were the trio, inseparable. "The moment I am free, I have to go and look for her." you said turning back to your screen "We should get together after work." Walter suggested "Ugh, that would be amazing, but I already have plans, roller derby plans." you said and Walter grinned at that "You're playing this evening?" he asked making you look towards him with a now "Yeah, it's just a fun game that the girls invited me to." you told him and the look Walter gave you could sense the question that was coming making you chuckle "Yes Walter, you can come and watch." you said and he grinned even wider pumping his fist into the air "Yes. I will be there." he said making you shake your head 'These men.' you thought referring to him and Ryan.

            Approaching the trace lab, from outside you saw Samantha inside working, so with a smile on your face, you approached the room "I heard a tall drink of water was working on the day shift now, so I had to come by to take a sip." you said making her look up with a grin to meet your eyes "Hez!" she called out coming around the table to engulf you in a hug "Welcome to the day shift Sammo." you grinned after you guys pulled away "Thank you, I love it in the day." she chuckled before going back to her previous position "Walter hasn't been giving you any trouble as yet right?" you asked and she chuckled with a shake of her head "Thankfully not at yet, but I think he's just giving me this day free since it's my first day time." you laughed at that "Then you know the pain is going to come full swing." you said and she sighed with a smile "I can feel it already." she commented and just as you were about to say something, your name was called pulling away your attention from her "Beautiful, I was looking for you." it was Ryan as he entered the lab coming to you "Sorry about that, I had to come and chat up a gorgeous gal." you said before turning to Sam "We'll catch up later." you said with a wink making her giggle "You got it." with that you turned back to Ryan and he gave you a look "What?" you asked and he shook his head before directing you out the lab "Must you flirt with every woman you find 'gorgeous'?" Ryan asked placing air quotes on the word gorgeous making you chuckle "Well, for your information, I knew her from night shift with Walter." you stated giving Ryan a look "And that's it?" Ryan asked with a raised brow "Yeah, wait, are you jealous Ryan Wolfe, whenever I flirt with women?" you asked curious as you both headed to your lab "Not really but it does raise some questions though." Ryan spoke truthfully "Well, you don't have anything to worry about babe, only have eyes for you and I don't think I swing that way." you told him and Ryan chuckled "You don't think? That doesn’t sound very reassuring." Ryan commented making tap his arm "We'll discuss this later, so what did you want me for?" you asked him as you both were in your lab now "Okay, right, I have some photos that I took of the crime scene that I wanted you to upload and check out for me." he said handing you a memory chip before going more into detail.

            "I am about to see my wife fight with a bunch of women while wearing a sexy outfit." Ryan commented as you both just got out the car and was making your way towards the building making you chuckle "Is that the real reason you're here, to be a pervert?" you asked with a raised brow and Ryan shook his head laughing "Strong words babe, but I'm just here to watch you and offer support." he said "And also check me out and maybe the other women?" you asked looking towards him "Not once have my eyes ever left your body while watching you play to look elsewhere." Ryan said truthfully making you smile "That's sweet but I won't mind if you looked at the other girls and watched them play." you told him but he shook his head "I'm good really, looking at you is enough." Ryan said throwing his arm over your shoulder making you giggle. "Okay Wolfe." you told him as you guys reached the door, so he opened it allowing you to enter first then him. You paused to turn to him because you guys had to part ways "Don't miss me too much." you said with a smile making Ryan chuckle "I'll try." he replied before you guys shard a kiss and parted ways.
        </p>
        <p class="story">
            "Hey man, you made it." Ryan said seeing Walter sit next to him "Of course. It's roller derby, no way I was going to miss this." Walter commented making Ryan laugh "It truly is amazing." Ryan stated making Walter agree. "Ooo, here they come." Walter said making Ryan towards the direction of the players entering the arena. They both made quick work looking for you and when they found you, your eyes was just meeting theirs so you waved their direction and they both grinned letting you know that they see you, so you quickly left the girl and skated over towards their direction "Big bear, you made it." you grinned as you guys did your special shake "Of course, it's roller derby baby." Walter said making you laugh "Well, cheer for me guys." you said before rolling back to your team before you guys got ready to get into position.

            "Ooo, damn Heather." Walter shouted as you pushed down a girl and that resulted in her getting up and coming after you and you both got into a heated argument "Is it bad that I wish Heather punches her?" Ryan asked Walter, eyes not leaving the interaction making him laugh "Kind of but I get what you're aiming for." Walter stated as a the referee interfered making you both break apart making Ryan groan. "Damn it." "Don't worry Wolfe, the game isn't over." Walter said with chuckle as the game resumed. As the game went on you were on a roll, but you felt a shove from behind making land face first in the ground and that made Ryan and Walter enter a state of pain and you were seeing red. Getting up you knew exactly who it was so wasting no time you skated over to her. "Looks like you'll get that fight you want Wolfe." Walter comment as they watched you head over to the girl shouted and things got pretty heated "Heather's waiting till she punches first." Ryan said watching "What makes you think that?" Walter asked curious "So it would be defense when she releases on the girl." Ryan replied and just then it happened, the girl punched you so you did not hold back giving her your personal blows "Oou, you seeing this Walter." Ryan said "Of course man, Heather could really throw hands, and you become worried about her." Walter said making the facial expressions as they watched you but a referee came and broke it up putting you both in time out but the girl getting the penalty because she swung first. "Heather didn’t receive a penalty right?" Ryan asked and Walter shook his head "Nah, she didn't swing first, smart." "Told you." Ryan said with a grin proud, boy were you badass.

        <p class="story">
            After the game was over, you all shook hands before retrieving to the lockers, to change, but you just took off your skates deciding to change at home one time, so you after you guys talked and cheered for winning, you bid the girls bye before meeting Ryan and Walter out front, because they were waiting for you. With skates and duffel bag in hand, you pushed opened the door spotting them. "Hey hey." you greeted alerting them of your presence and they both turn to you with grins "Damn Heather, amazing game." Walter complimented as you guy high fived "And I felt those punches girl." he added making you chuckle "Well, no way was I going to sit and take that." you said with a wink before turning to Ryan "You did really amazing babe." Ryan commented reaching for your duffel bag to carry for you "Thanks guys. It was fun, minus the burst lip." you commented reaching up to graze it "Does it hurt?" Ryan asked and shook your head "Not really, plus I've received worse." you stated "Damn, you really are bad ass and low key scary, remind me to never piss you off." you laughed at that before resting a hand on Walter's arm "You're safe." you told him before looking between the two "Ready to go, my body is starting to get sore?"
        </p>
        <p class="story">
            The minute you were through the front door, you stretched your body to prevent any cramps from coming on and Ryan just stood there watching you because he was majorly turned on from watching you all evening. "Everything okay babe?" you asked not turning to him still stretching "You've been quiet, was my performance not good enough, or are you mad I got into a fight with that girl?" you asked turning now and saw Ryan was checking you out so reading his facial expressions you knew he was feeling the exact opposite so smirking you moved towards him "Don't judge me but…" Ryan started before taking hold of your hips pulling your body to be flushed against his "I am extremely turned on right now from watching you play and how you're currently dressed." Ryan said making your smile grow wider "And here I was thinking that maybe you were mad at me for throwing hands and losing my cool." he shook his "The total opposite actually, that was extremely hot to watch." Ryan blatantly said while lowering his head to place kisses in your neck but you had to stop him "No, I'm all sweaty." you whined trying to pull away from him but he shrugged completely unbothered "And I don't care." you chuckled at that but before you could protest any more Ryan had you lifted up, tossing you over his shoulder "It doesn’t bother me because I'm having you no matter what." Ryan said heading off in the direction of the bathroom.
        </p>
        <p class="story">
            You just stepped out the shower and was currently inspecting your lip in the mirror. "The pain finally arrived?" Ryan asked as he finally stepped out the shower seeing you looking at your lip so you shook your head "Nah, just bummed that I got it." you said with a sigh "Well, that's what you get for not wanting to punch first." Ryan stated with a raised brow making you give him a sort of glare "Excuse me, are you calling me a wuss?" you turned your body to fully look at him and Ryan chuckled "Of course not. We both know you are quite the opposite, it's just maybe you should try punching first next time." he said with a shrugged before leaving the bathroom, making you follow him "But you know why I always don't punch first." you commented folding your arms standing your ground as you watched Ryan head over to the dresser "I know and it's smart, but just once I'll like to see you get in the first hit and not caring about the consequences." Ryan said with his back turned to you so you raised a brow "So you want me to lose control, that's it?" you asked trying to understand and Ryan sighed because he doesn't know if what he's about to say will get him in trouble "Maybe" he said hesitantly while getting dressed "Okay, so be like you then, and react without thinking?" you said smugly, hands going to your hips and that made Ryan roll his eyes "I do have self-control when it comes to beating up people." Ryan said making you scoff "Yeah right." you said now finally moving from your position and joining Ryan at dresser so you could get dressed yourself "What's that supposed to mean, I do." he stated folding his arms while staring at you "Right Ryan, and the last guy that pissed you off by saying a couple words that you didn't like, he didn't end up with a broken nose." you said giving him a look before turning back to the drawer, he opened and closed his mouth because you were right "Whatever." he said defeated before leaving the bedroom, so just currently only wearing a pair of knickers, you put on one of Ryan's t-shirts before leaving the bedroom to see where he went. You found him currently on the sofa, laying back flipping through the channels looking for something to watch, so you went directly and stood in front him "Mad at me?" you asked him and his eyes left the tv to look up at you and he just shook his head before looking back at the tv, so not buying it you moved and placed yourself to straddle his lap, keeping yourself sturdy with hands on his torso "I'm sorry, you are not completely bad when it comes to exhibiting self-control. You do have your moments, and I also do understand what you're getting with me, punching first but you know me Ryan, I always over think every situation and I like playing things smartly." you said honestly so Ryan looked away from the tv to meet your eyes before laying his head back against the sofa remaining quiet "Not going to say anything?" you asked completely confused at his behaviour, so before replying, Ryan just brought his hands to run along your bare thighs "I'm really not mad beautiful, and you're not wrong, that part of me I really have to learn to control because it could really get me into trouble one of these days. Also, you're not wrong with the method you use, because that way, you don't come off as the bad guy." Ryan said smiling up at you making one grow on your lips "But…" he started halting his hands "Just once, I want to see you punch someone first." Ryan said with a grin making you chuckle "Okay, I'll see what I can do." you said with a wink "Thank you, I just think it'll be a major turn on." that made you roll your eyes "Such a pervert you are." and Ryan laughed "I'm merely your husband." he said so you leaned forward placing your face before his "Lucky me." you said with a grin before giving him a kiss "So that doesn’t make me a pervert." he commented as your lips separated "Whatever helps you sleep at night babe." you told him before going to fully lay on him, head going into the crook of his neck and Ryan brought his arms to wrap around your waist, to keep you close against him.
