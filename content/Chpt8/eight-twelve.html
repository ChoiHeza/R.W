        Ryan jumped out his sleep after having a nightmare and was currently
        hunched over the side of bed, with his hands on his knees. He slowly
        looked back to make sure you were still asleep, and once he saw that
        your breathing was still even, he slowly got up and went to the
        bathroom. As you were in bed rolling over, you stretched out your hand
        and reached for Ryan to feel his side of the bed empty so looking around
        you saw light coming from the bathroom and could hear the running
        faucet. You figured he just went to the bathroom so you laid back down
        to go back to sleep, but it never came because all you kept hearing was
        the water running. You started to get worried, so you pulled the covers
        back and got up out of bed heading over to the bathroom "Babe?" you
        called out and adjusting your eyes to the light, you saw Ryan hunched
        over the sink with his back to you "Yeah?" he called back softly not
        looking up or moving to meet your eyes "Everything okay?" you asked
        coming over to him and you managed to see Ryan shake his head but he
        kept quiet. "Hey, what's wrong?" you asked standing next to him now,
        resting a hand on his back offering him a comforting rub, so with a
        sigh, Ryan turned off the tap before speaking "I had uh.. I had…." Ryan
        said with his voice breaking so you immediately took hold of him and
        hugged him from behind and that caused him to finally break down in
        tears.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        You both were back in bed now with Ryan laying in your arms as you still
        offered him comfort. He told you it was a nightmare he had where you
        were killed along with your child and he was too late to saving you
        both. You had to keep reminding him that it was just a dream but that
        was easier said than done. "What if that was a sign?" Ryan asked
        breaking the silence "A sign for what?" you asked assuming he was
        talking about the dream "That we shouldn't have kids." Ryan said before
        looking up at you "It was just a dream Ryan but we can hold off from
        having children at the moment if that's what you want, we still have
        time to think it true because no one is rushing us to have them at the
        moment." you said truthfully and Ryan sighed "Thank you, but you know I
        want them with you just.." he said cutting short but you know what he
        meant "You're scared for them, I know." you continued while running your
        fingers through his hair and he nodded so you both shared a sad smile
        before he laid back down on your chest.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        You were currently in front the tv with your cup of coffee watching the
        morning news as Ryan was in the kitchen eating his cereal "Are you
        planning on getting one?" Ryan asked as he entered the living with his
        bowl in hand "Nah, they look and seem cool but I don’t like idea of
        owning a phone that's see through, anyone can see what I'm doing on it."
        you said not taking your eyes from the tv because they were advertising
        this new phone that's supposed to be super high tech "I understand that
        but I'm surprised you aren't getting one, because you're all about the
        technology." Ryan commented making you laugh "You're not wrong, but I
        don't have a purpose for it and that would be a waste of money." you
        said and Ryan nodded at that. "Are you feeling better?" you asked taking
        your eyes from the screen to look at Ryan and he sighed before shaking
        his head not giving a reply "And that's okay." you said offering him a
        smile before getting up and heading over to him. With his mouth still
        full of cereal, you placed a kiss on his cheek just to let him know that
        he can take his time to be okay. "Thank you." he said following after
        you into the kitchen "For what?" you asked "For being patient and
        understanding." Ryan replied coming over to the sink to place his bowl
        before hugging you from behind, not giving you a chance to reply. "And
        I'm sorry, for being so indecisive." Ryan said and that made you turn in
        his arms "Don't apologize for that because this is a big decision, one
        that's going to change our lives, so it's okay to be not sure right
        now." you reassured him and Ryan released a sigh of relief at that and
        he's so thankful to have someone like you currently as his wife.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "So do you want to go out tonight or stay in and have a movie night?"
        you asked Ryan as you closed your locker with a smile which he returned
        "Let's go out, because I want to see you all dolled up." Ryan said with
        a smirk leaning against his locker "Okay, do you have a place in mind?"
        with that question a grin appeared on Ryan's face "Of course and it's a
        surprise." you raised a brow at that and looked around before going over
        to him "So I'm guessing it's going to be that kind of night?" you asked
        placing a hand on his chest and before Ryan had time reply his phone
        buzzed alerting him of a case "You wouldn't believe where the call out
        is to." he said looking back up to you "Where?" "That tech guy, that's
        supposed to be launching the new phone today." he replied and your eyes
        widened at that "No way." you said in disbelief and Ryan nodded at that
        "Yeah, I gotta go, so I'll see you?" he said and you nodded at that and
        making sure that the coast was still clear, Ryan took hold your waist
        and pulled you closer to him "Let's get through the day so we could have
        an amazing night, okay?" you nodded "Yes sir." you replied and Ryan
        winked at that "Good." so he quickly pulled you in for a kiss before you
        guys broke apart, going your separate ways.

        "Aw man, this is so cool." Ryan said as he entered the apartment with
        the victims' phone packaged in an evidence bag "It's just a phone
        Wolfe." Walter commented as he what Ryan had in his hand "Yeah, but do
        you see how amazing it is and I can't wait till Heather sees this, I
        know she's going to be super excited to hack into this." Ryan said and
        they both went back and forth at it before Calleigh came over to them
        "For a guy that is so tech savy, I don't see a television." she
        commented "I'm pretty sure when I came in, I saw a tv on-" Walter was
        cut off immediately by the tv being turned on "Whoa, Walter, how did you
        do that?" Ryan asked amazed "I'm not sure." he said looking pretty
        stunned himself "Wait a minute, let me see something, 'Football'." Ryan
        called out and the channel changed to football resulting in both Walter
        and Ryan yelling out towards the tv making Calleigh roll her eyes
        "Heather would love this apartment, I'm telling you, she would
        definitely live here and we fight to this tv on who gets to watch their
        sport." Walter laughed at that "We all know Heather's going to win on
        this one." "He's not wrong." Calleigh agreed with Walter and Ryan sighed
        "Wishful thinking." and they both laughed at him again.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "My beautiful, I am here to make you very very happy." came Ryan's voice
        making you turn to face him "Is this you coming to tell me that you
        finally love basketball and would come to games with Walter and I?" you
        said hopefully and Ryan laughed at that "Okay, not that happy. But…"
        Ryan said raising the phone in his head and your eyes widened "No way!
        Is that what I think it is?" and Ryan nodded rapidly before giving the
        device over to you and the smile would not leave your face "Wow, I can't
        believe I'm actually holding one in my hands and not just any phone, it
        belonged to the creator himself." Ryan just looked on at you as he
        realized that all your attention now is on this phone "I guess I'll
        leave you two alone." Ryan commented with a smile and shake of his head
        "Yeah yeah." he just chuckled at your behaviour before leaving.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Mrs. Wolfe." came H's voice as he entered your lab and you got into
        just talking about how amazing the phone is and all the features it has
        to offer getting carried away and H released a smile before calling your
        name again to capture your attention "Mrs. Wolfe." that made you
        instantly stop your ranting "Right sorry," you said before getting
        explaining what you found out. You showed him the last set of text
        messages that the victim received and where they were sent from.

      <p class="story">
        You heard Samantha passed her detectives exams so you were currently on
        your way to congratulate her "There she is, the girl of the hour." you
        said with a knock on the door alerting her of your presence before
        entering "Hey, news travels fast huh?" she asked and you nodded as you
        both shared a grinned "Congrats Sammo, feeling good?" you asked her and
        she sighed "Thanks and no, still waiting for my first call out so
        nothing doesn't feel any different at the moment." she sulked so you
        offered her a comforting hand "Don't worry, you're going to get one just
        now, but be thankful because it's safer in here than out there, trust
        me." you reassured "I know, but I just miss being in the field." she
        told you and you nodded understanding that "I know, but the day is still
        young and that call out will come." you said with a pump of your fist
        making her laugh "Thanks Hez." "Always Sam."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        You just received a call that you were needed at the office so with a
        sigh you turned towards Dave with a heavy heart because you were
        currently enjoying yourself working with the phone and uncovering all
        the secrets it held "Dave, I gotta head to the office, so I'm leaving
        this to you." you told him with a sulk and Dave chuckled at your
        behaviour "Don't worry, I'll let you know about all the cool things I
        find tomorrow and I won't leave out a single detail." Dave said in
        reassurance and that made you feel so much better "Thank you." and with
        that you just discussed some things that Dave needed to know before you
        left to find Ryan to let him know that you gotta leave.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        Passing in the hallway you spotted him in the lab with Calleigh, so with
        a knock at the door, they both looked your direction and greeted you
        "Hey, what brings you by?" Ryan asked looking away from what he was
        doing to give you his attention. "I just got a call, I gotta head to the
        office." "Need me to walk you down?" Ryan asked you shook your head
        "You're busy, I just need the keys." "You sure?" Ryan asked so you gave
        him a smile "Yes Ryan, I'm sure. I'm a big girl." you told him earning a
        chuckle from Calleigh "Okay, just give me a call when you get there."
        you nodded at that "Yes sir." with that Ryan retrieved the keys from his
        pocket and handed them to you "Thanks baby." you said blowing him kiss
        making him smile wide before leaving.

      <p class="story">
        Ryan told you to don't worry about picking him up from work because
        Delko was passing your direction so he'll get a ride with him. That
        honestly worked out perfectly because you have more time to get ready
        since you take longer than him, so the first thing you did when you got
        was showered before deciding what to out tonight. With your
        undergarments on you headed to the closet to look for a dress and at the
        same time Ryan got in, and made a beeline for the bedroom knowing that's
        where you'll be. "Hey beautiful, I'm home." Ryan greeted making you look
        towards him just as he entered the bedroom "Hey babe." you greeted back
        "I take back the beautiful and I'm replacing it with gorgeous." Ryan
        said as he caught sight of how you're currently dressed making you laugh
        "No distractions Ryan." you said giving him a look and he shook his head
        "You know that's impossible." Ryan said as he approached you so you
        placed your arms out to stop him from coming further "Come on babe,
        don't be like that." Ryan pleaded so you harden your glare "Shower
        first, so I'll know we're getting somewhere and it'll give me time to
        pick out a dress because I still haven't decided on what to wear." you
        said sternly so Ryan sighed before raising his hands in surrender.
        "Okay, but at least allow me to give to a kiss." Ryan suggested so you
        gave him narrowed eyes "Hmmm, is this a set up?" you asked him and he
        shook his head innocently "No it isn't, I promise." Ryan said so you
        deemed him okay and dropped your hand allowing him to enter your
        personal space "So easy." he said and before you had a chance to catch
        on, Ryan had you trapped in his hold, clearly tricking you. With quick
        movement, he lifted and hoisted you over his shoulder making his way
        towards the bed before tossing you down and hovering over you, keeping
        you trapped so you released a sigh defeated "I never stood a stance did
        I?" you asked him and Ryan shook his head "Dressed like this, nah." Ryan
        said smiling down at you "So is dinner still on for tonight, or was I
        looking for a dress in vain?" you asked "Depends on what time I'm
        finished with you." and before you could ask anything else, Ryan
        connected his lips with yours.
