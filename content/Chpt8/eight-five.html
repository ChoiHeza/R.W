            "Have you ever thought about not wearing the jacket sometime?" you asked Ryan as you hugged him from behind seeing him dressed "Why, the jacket completes the look?" Ryan questioned so you placed a kiss on his clothed back before coming around to his front so grip his arms "Because you look quite handsome like this." you said with a bite of your lip making Ryan look down at you with a smirk "So I don't look just as good?" he asked with a raised brow and you nodded "You do, of course you do, but it's just something about this look that's nice." you said running your hands up and down his arms now, feeling his biceps, that made Ryan grinned, bringing his hands to capture your waist "Are you just saying that because the shirt is green?" you shook your head "No sir, it would be any colour." you said with a wink and Ryan shook his head at you before leaning down to peck your lips "At least I know what kind of Heather Wolfe I'm dealing with today." Ryan said making you chuckle.

            You just receive a call that you were needed at the office so you headed Ryan's direction after hearing he was in the trace lab. You spotted him with Walter as they were discussing something, so you knocked before entering "Hey guys." you greeted with a smile "Small bear, what's up?" Walter said with a grin "Came looking for Ryan." you said going over to him "Yeah, sure, what is it babe?" Ryan asked turning to you "I just got called into the office and I'll most likely be there for the rest of the day." you told him so he nodded "Need the car keys?" Ryan asked so nodded "Yes sir." you replied and he fished them out from his pocket and handed them to you "I'll most likely finish work before you so call to let me know when you're done." you said "Got it, need me to walk you down?" you shook your head "No need, you're busy." you gestured to the science stuff in front of them with a chuckle but Ryan tilted his head "You sure?" he asked and Walter laughed "Go walk her Wolfe, cause I think you're the one that's not sure." he said making you laugh and Ryan sigh "Not true Walter." Ryan said removing his lab coat and was about to reach for his jacket but he remembered what you told him this morning so he decided to leave it behind "Be right back Walter." Ryan said so you told Walter bye and he bid you bye as well. "You know that you don't have to walk me down every time right?" you said the moment you guys were in the elevator so Ryan placed his hand on your lower back before looking at you "I know, but I want to." he said with a wink and kiss to your temple "Well, thank you, I love the company." you said making Ryan grin "Always."

            You were finished before Ryan's shift was over as expected so you gave him a call and he said it's still going to be a while till he's finished, so you decided to run some errands to kill the time. While at the gas station to top off the car, you went inside to buy a couple of snacks. "What should I get Ryan?" you asked yourself as you were looking over the various sweet treats, thinking which on he'll want. "You look like you can't make up your mind there." came a voice from behind you, so turning, you looked to see who it was and it was a face you haven't seen in a long time so immediately your face fell "You." was all you said and the man grinned "You remembered me." he stated "It's hard to forget the guy that threaten and attacked you." you said with a scoff before turning back to the snacks and that annoyed him "Aren't you scared that I won't attack you again?" he asked coming closer to you so you sighed before turning back to him "Touch me and I swear I'll beat you myself." you said giving him a glare and he chuckled stepping back raising his hands in defense "You're cute, I guess I'll see you around." he said with a wink while stepping away more before turning and leaving. Your eyes did not leave his form till he was out for sight, so releasing a breathe you didn't know you were holding and you thanked God that that interaction didn't went south. You decided to make a quick pick of the snacks and headed to the cashier to pay before wanted to get far away from that gas station as possible.

            Ryan called to let you know that he was finished with his shift so leaving from where you were you headed there and waited outside for him. It was wasn't a long wait till you see Ryan coming towards the car, so you got out to switch seats. "Hey beautiful." Ryan greeted as he got closer and you smiled greeting him back but with a hug "Hey, hey." Ryan said as he felt you squeeze him "Everything okay?" he asked leaning back to look at you and you sighed "I ran into the guy that attacked me, years ago that got arrested." the moment those words left your mouth, Ryan's hands captured your face "Are you okay, did he hurt you?" Ryan asked and you shook your head "I'm fine, but it seems like he's going to be keeping a very close eye on me." Ryan didn't like what he was hearing "Let's get you home and we'll talk about it." you nodded before you both turned back to the car and you gave Ryan the keys.

        <p class="story">
            "So what did he tell you?" Ryan asked facing you as you both sat on the sofa "He asked if I wasn't scared that he'll attack me again." you said recalling the interaction and this left Ryan feeling unsettled "Are you scared?" he asked and you thought for a moment before shaking your head "Not really, because I know I can handle myself but there is a little fear present." you said truthfully "Did you have your weapon with you?" Ryan asked and you shook your head "It was in the car, not on my person." Ryan nodded thinking that he'll have to put something into place for you to be able to take your gun with you anywhere. "What are you thinking?" you asked him cause you noticed he was and he shook his head "Something, but don't worry about it for the moment." you nodded at that "But please when I'm not around, just be extra aware of your surroundings, and if you know you can't take him, call me and run." Ryan said seriously while taking your hand in his "I promise, I won't play hero." you said with reassurance and that made Ryan feel somewhat better but he still hated that the guy was out there now and clearly up to something. "Good, come here." Ryan gestured for you to come closer so he could take you in his arms. His arms just wrapped around you keeping you close hoping that nothing happens to you and if it does, he's there to protect you. "You're okay?" you asked Ryan "Yeah, just worried." he replied with a kiss your forehead so you tightened your arms around him to hopefully help ease his mind.
