        You were up before Ryan and was currently in the living room watching TV
        because you didn't want to disturb him. It was like four in the morning
        and you were only up because you had to keep going to the bathroom to
        pee and now you were craving something to eat so that’s how Ryan found
        you, in front the TV stuffing your face with a jar of pickles. “How long
        were you up for?” you heard Ryan’s voice making you look his direction
        “Hey, about an hour now.” you replied and Ryan came and sat next to you
        and you both greeted each other morning before continuing the
        conversation “Is it the twins?” you nodded “My bladder has become a toy
        for them and they got me craving pickles.” you said holding up the jar
        for him to see and he released a chuckle placing his hand on your
        stomach “Giving trouble little ones?” Ryan asked talking to your stomach
        so you turned back to the TV leaving him there in his own world with the
        babies.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        Engrossed in the show, you whined when you felt the need to pee again,
        so placing down the jar you moved to get up “Gotta pee again.” Ryan
        nodded allowing you to pass. Coming back you realized Ryan received
        another jar of pickles for you and he placed it next to the one you were
        using. “You know you didn’t had to get me another jar.” you told him
        sitting back down “I know, but I wanted to.” that made you smile, so you
        gave him a thank you kiss “Thank you.” “Always baby.” picking back up
        the jar you sat back and continued watching TV. “Tired?” Ryan asked as a
        few moments passed “A little bit, I guess it’s a good thing, I have to
        go into the office first today, so I should be able to get some sleep
        before heading off to the lab.”
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        And that’s what happened, you dropped sleep and Ryan took you to bed
        before he got ready for his day, but making sure to move quietly to not
        wake you. With a kiss to your forehead, he left for his day of work. You
        woke around 8 and got ready for work, making sure to eat the breakfast
        that Ryan left for you before leaving for the office.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        You arrived to the lab around 11 and was currently in the locker room
        putting away your belongings “Hey, now got in?” you heard Natalia’s
        voice, alerting you of her presence “Hey, yeah, had some meetings at the
        office this morning.” you replied closing your locker and turning to
        face her “How are you feeling?” she asked doing the same “Honestly,
        tired. The twins had me up from three this morning. Constant pee breaks
        and a pickles craving.” that made Natalia laugh “Pickles?” you nodded
        “Yes, pickles, I ate almost two jars this morning and I don’t even like
        pickles.” you laughed now as you moved closer towards her “May I?”
        Natalia asked gesturing to touch your stomach and you nodded. She placed
        her hand on it with a smile “Have they kicked yet?” you shook your head
        with a sad smile “Nothing, Ryan even tried singing hoping to get a
        reaction but nothing.” Natalia smiled at that “Ryan singing, that I
        gotta hear.” that made you both laugh “Maybe they don’t like his
        singing, that’s why they haven’t reacted as yet.” the moment you said
        that, you felt a move in your stomach and so did Natalia. You both
        shared a surprised expression “Did you feel that?” you asked her and she
        nodded before placing the other hand “I did, I can’t believe it.” as she
        said that they moved some more making both your smiles widen. “I think
        they like you.” “And is this the first time?” you nodded happily “Yeah,
        the very first time they’re kicking.” “Ryan isn’t going to be mad
        right?” Natalia asked “Mad about what?” came Ryan’s voice as he entered
        the locker room making you both look towards him like deer caught in
        headlights “Uh, the twins just kicked.” you told him and his eyes
        widened quickly coming towards you guys “What? The twins kicked, how?”
        Ryan’s hand was on your stomach now “Natalia and I were talking about
        you and we suddenly just felt them kick.” you said grinning “Yeah, they
        kicked twice.” Natalia said still grinning “And I missed it.” Ryan said
        with a sigh, just then Natalia phone rang signaling she was needed
        elsewhere, so with a happy smile she departed knowing that she got to
        experience something amazing.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        “How is it that they kicked for her twice and not once for me. I’m the
        one that helped made them.” Ryan sulked as he was standing next to you
        in your lab while you were sitting in your high chair and you laughed at
        him “Why you had to put it like that.” he shrugged “I’m being serious.”
        “You’ll get to feel them, don’t worry.” you told him while resting a
        hand on his shoulder but that just made him sulk more. Ryan’s phone rang
        “Yeah, I’ll be there.” he said before hanging up and looking at you
        “That was H, I’m needed at a scene.” “Okay baby, be careful.” “Always.”
        you guys shared a smile before he was gone.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        “Heather Heather.” came Eric’s voice as he entered your lab “Delko, what
        brings you by?” you asked as he came to stand next to you “Two things.
        First, I need this drive decrypted and second, I heard from Natalia that
        the twins kicked.” Delko said with a smile at the end, handing you the
        drive “Yes, it was truly a nice feeling.” you said while hooking up the
        drive “And also I heard that Ryan wasn’t too happy about it.” at the
        mention of his name you felt them kick again so you quickly took Delko’s
        hand and placed it on the spot you felt the movement and his eye lit up
        immediately “Wow.” he said in amazement as he felt them kick himself so
        you both shared a smile. They were kicking a lot “Is it hurting you?”
        you shook your head “We can’t let Ryan know about this because then
        he’ll want to know why they’re kicking for everyone else but him.” you
        nodded “You’re right, let’s keep this between us.”
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        Natalia was walking by and saw the interaction knowing exactly what was
        happening as she was her way to a lab so that’s how Ryan came barging
        into your lab “Delko too?” he asked and you were caught off guard. You
        were standing now because you got tired sitting “What about him?” you
        asked somewhat confused “He felt the twins kick.” that made you sigh
        “How did you know about that, we promised to keep it a secret. Damn you
        Eric.” you said the last part under your breath “It wasn’t him, Natalia
        walked by the lab and saw you guys and told me about it” you sighed at
        that and took his hand turning towards him “I’m sorry. I can’t control
        it and if I could I would of allowed you to be the first person to feel
        them.” “I know hun.” “But the day isn’t over and I know they’re going to
        kick some more, trust me.” Ryan nodded but sighed nonetheless.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        “Isn’t it an amazing feeling?” Natalia said while talking to Calleigh
        “It felt magical almost, like wow, they are little beings inside of
        Heather” Calleigh said with the biggest smile and Ryan happened to be
        there in the locker room with them as well “Not you too” he said
        disheartened so Calleigh gave him a sorrowful smile “Sorry.” Ryan waves
        his hand “No need to apologize, my unborn children clearly don’t
        recognize me as someone important” “Don’t say that. That’s not true, you
        just weren’t there at the right time but the day isn’t over and I can
        guarantee you that you’ll feel them kick.” Calleigh reassured him but
        just that moment you and Eric entered the room “Hello hello” you greeted
        everyone and Eric did the same as you guys went to your respective
        lockers “As we were making our way down, they kicked again.” you told
        the team with a smile and Ryan sighed “Amazing” Ryan said sarcastically
        making you all look towards him “Ryan..” you said his name and he sighed
        “Sorry, I’m just upset that everyone here got to feel my children kick
        before me.” you understood where he was coming from and how upset he
        was. So sensing the atmosphere, the rest of the team quietly cleared out
        giving you guys some privacy so you approached Ryan and took his hand,
        pulling him to sit on the bench with you “Talk to me” you told Ryan
        squeezing his hand and he released a heavy sigh before speaking “I feel
        like I’m already a bad father.” “Just because you haven’t felt the
        babies kicked?” Ryan nodded in reply and that made you smile “Well Ryan
        Wolfe, I hate to break it to you, it’s going to take a lot more than
        that to be a bad Father, trust me.” that made Ryan look up at you with a
        smile “Really?” you nodded taking his hand that you were holding and
        placing it on your stomach before continuing “If they don’t kick, that’s
        okay because it doesn’t make you any less than a father to these two
        because after all you did help make them right?” Ryan smiled at that
        with a nod before laughing and at the sound of his laughter you felt the
        twins move, way more than they did for the day “Whoa” you said and the
        action caught Ryan off guard “Did they just…?” Ryan asked unable to
        finish the sentence and you nodded “They did, and way more than they did
        today. I think it’s your laugh.” you told Ryan and he immediately
        grinned coming closer feeling incredibly happy that they moved for him
        and he got to feel it “You guys moved for me?” it’s like they heard him
        because one of them kicked. Ryan was currently over the moon at this
        feeling “Did you feel that beautiful, I think they can hear me.” Ryan’s
        eyes would not leave your stomach.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        At home and after showering and eating, you were currently in bed
        watching TV while Ryan was finishing up in the bathroom brushing his
        teeth. “Do you have the lotion with you?” Ryan asked peeking his head
        out of the bathroom “Yeah, it’s here on the night stand.” He mumbled
        something before returning to the bathroom to finish up. Exiting he came
        and sat next to you on the bed holding out his hand for the lotion, so
        you reached across to your night stand and handed it to him “My favorite
        time of the night. " Ryan grinned making you laugh and shake your head
        “I remember before that would be us having sex.” Ryan laughed at that
        while placing lotion on his hands positioning himself to lay near your
        stomach “We will get back there, but right now, let me enjoy this.” you
        weren’t going to argue with him on that because this time was truly a
        special moment. While Ryan rubs on the anti stretch marks lotion he
        talks to the babies while you sometimes watch him or watch TV and just
        let him have that moment to himself.
