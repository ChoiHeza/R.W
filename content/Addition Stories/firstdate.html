        You were getting ready for work when you heard the door bell, so pausing
        what you were doing, you headed towards the door and peeped through the
        hole and saw it was a certain police officer, so with a grin you opened
        the door "Hey Officer Wolfe." you joked because he was in his police
        uniform clearly on his way out to work. He chuckled before replying
        "Hey, Morning. I know it's pretty early but I wanted to stop by to ask
        you something before I headed off." you nodded and allowed him in. With
        the door closed behind him, you faced each other "What's up?" you asked
        and saw he entered a state of nervousness which you found cute "Well,
        um, I wanted to ask you something." you just kept smiling "I'm
        listening, what do you want to ask me?" he reached his hand up and
        started to run it along the back of his neck "Well, I remember the
        conversation we had last week where we were talking about movies and you
        mentioned that you loved Tom Cruise so while on my way from work
        yesterday, I saw the cinema will be showing the new Mission Impossible,
        and I was wondering if you would like to go with me?" his ears were red
        at the end of his cute ramble "Are you asking me out on a date Ryan?"
        you asked him with a grin "Uh, I think I am, so what do you say?" Ryan
        asked more confidently now "It's a yes and not because we're going to
        see Tom Cruise." you said with a wink making Ryan grin "Thank you. You
        won't be disappointed." he said with a point of his finger heading
        towards your door "Yes sir. Wait, what time?" you asked Ryan as he was
        almost out through the door "Is seven o'clock okay?" you nodded before
        replying "Seven is perfect." "Great, so I'll pick you up then." he said
        with a grin not believing his luck "Can't wait." you said returning his
        smile and after final greetings, he was gone and there was a permanent
        smile on your face as you finished getting ready for work.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        Let's just say you were in high spirits for the whole day and they only
        lifted when you entered your apartment and you felt your phone vibrate,
        it was a message from Ryan.
        <b>~Ryan W.: We're still on for tonight right?~</b> you replied to him
        with an of course because there was no way you were going to miss out on
        this date. With giddiness running through your blood, you started to get
        ready for your first offical date with Ryan.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        As you were looking over yourself in the mirror making sure everything
        was perfect, that's when you heard the door bell. So with a grin and
        nervousness, you headed towards the door. With a final pep talk, you
        opened the door to reveal one Ryan Wolfe standing there with a bouquet
        of flowers in his left hand "Hey." you both greeted each other with wide
        smiles "Come in." you said stepping aside allowing him to ente. "These
        are for you." he said reaching the flowers towards you, so you took them
        from him with a thank you "These are lovely. I wasn't expecting any."
        you said truthfully because you've never received flowers before "Well,
        I'm thankful that I'm the first then. Because someone as beautiful as
        you, deserves beautiful things." you blushed heavily at that "Aren't you
        the sweet talker, but thank you." you giggled and Ryan chuckled "Just
        speaking the truth." you just couldn't stop smiling at that and Ryan
        noticed making him very happy and knowing that he's off to a great start
        "I'll put these in water and then we can go." you said gesturing to the
        flowers and he gave you a nod, watching you until you disappeared
        towards the kitchen.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "So, the movie starts at eight thirty and I was thinking if I could take
        you to dinner first?" Ryan asked as you both walked towards his car
        "Dinner and a movie?" you asked and Ryan nodded "Yeah, but that's only
        if you want to, or we could do something else." Ryan said quickly as to
        not appear that he's pressuring you into anything "I don't mind at all,
        that sounds perfect." you said truthfully making him grin "Perfect. Then
        leave everything to me." you blushed at that "I'm parked here." Ryan
        pointed towards his car and you headed towards the passenger side to
        open the door but Ryan stopped you "I can handle it." you suggested "I
        know you can, but in my presence you shouldn't have to." he said opening
        the door for you and honestly you were truly impressed "Why thank you."
        you said offering him a smile which he returned and when you were in the
        car safely, he closed the door heading over to the drivers side. "So
        where are we going for dinner?" you asked as he pulled out the parking
        lot "That's a surprise unless you're like super allergic to something
        that I should know about?" he asked giving you a quick look and you
        shook your head "Not allergic to anything that I know of." "Good, then
        it's still a surprise." you chuckled at that "Okay Ryan, surprise me."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        “No way!” you said in amazement as you guys arrived at the restaurant.
        Ryan parked at the cinema one time and decided to walk to the restaurant
        which wasn’t that far away because he figured it would be nice to talk
        and get to know each other which you gladly accepted “Surprise.”Ryan
        said grinning down at you “How did you manage to get a reservation?
        They’re always booked up.” you asked in pure amazement “I know a guy and
        I wanted our first date to be perfect.” “Well, wherever you take me
        would be perfect but this is very much appreciated.” you said giving him
        a smile “Only the best for you.” that caught you off guard and it made
        you blush intensely “So shall we go in?” Ryan suggested holding out his
        hand which you took “We shall.” with that you guys headed into the
        restaurant.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        “How are you feeling?” Ryan asked as you guys walked hand in hand
        towards the cinema. “Full and happy.” you said giving your stomach a tap
        making Ryan laugh “I’m glad that you enjoyed it.” “It was perfect and
        was the food delicious.” you said with a contented sigh and grinned
        looking down at you “I guess we’ll have to make there a regular dinning
        spot then.” that made you look up at him “Regular?” you asked and Ryan
        nodded “Of course, well, that’s if you want to go on other dates with me
        because I’m hoping this isn’t a one time thing?” Ryan asked a little
        nervous at the end “I would love to go on other dates with you. I’m
        really enjoying myself and the date isn’t even over.” you said giving
        him a smile and Ryan was very happy to hear that. “That’s a major relief
        because I’m really enjoying myself as well.” at this point you both were
        such a smiling mess because of all the nice feelings you were receiving
        from each other.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        As entertaining as the movie is playing in front of Ryan he can’t help
        but steal glances at you from time to time, because one he can’t believe
        how lucky he is to be on a date with you and two, he can’t get over how
        gorgeous you are and you’re even more so in this moment because you’re
        watching something that he picked and you’re absolutely enjoying it
        “Gosh he’s so pretty.” you commented as Tom Cruise appeared on screen
        “Yes, very pretty.” Ryan replied still staring at you but you were so
        caught up in the movie to even hear him, which he’s very thankful for
        because he wasn’t even referring to Tom Cruise.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        “Oh my gosh! That movie was amazing.” you started before going on
        talking about your favourite parts that occurred during movie as you and
        Ryan was walking out the theater. Honestly Ryan only recognized some of
        the scenes you mentioned because his attention was mostly focused on you
        than the movie and listening to you rant currently was very cute to
        Ryan. “What was your favourite part?” you asked Ryan as you saw he was
        intently staring at you “Huh?” he asked not catching your question
        because he was very distracted by you “I asked what was your favourite
        part of the movie?” you asked again but was looking at him this time.
        Ryan thought to himself that he had to think of something quick because
        he barely paid attention to the movie “Of course the plot twist, when
        they reveal the truth.” Ryan answered based on his knowledge of the
        previous Mission Impossible movies. You grinned at that so Ryan figured
        that he succeeded in answering the question “Oh my, the plot twist is
        always the best.”. You guys continued talking more about the movie as
        you made your way to the car.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        “Ready to go home or do you feel like going for ice cream?” Ryan asked
        as you guys stood outside his car “I would love to go for ice cream.”
        you said with a smile and also super thankful that Ryan doesn’t want to
        end the date just yet because you were having such a great time “Great,
        there’s this new ice cream slash milkshake parlor that recently opened
        called Miami Chill that I’ve wanted to check out but decided to wait to
        take you with me.” Ryan said looking down at you with a smile “Really?”
        you asked and he nodded while opening the passenger door for you “Yeah,
        is that weird?” “No it isn’t, that’s actually really sweet.” you said
        with a smile before getting into the car. Once you were secured in, Ryan
        went to his side and got in “You never know, this might become a regular
        spot for us as well.” Ryan said hopeful and you nodded returning his
        smile “That would be nice.”
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        “He actually did?” Ryan asked laughing as you were telling him some of
        your childhood stories because he wanted to know a bit about your past
        “Yes and it was the funniest, craziest thing ever.” you said as you both
        laughed more “I don’t have memories as crazy as those.” Ryan stated as
        you both calm down “I guess that’s when you grow up in the Caribbean but
        I’m pretty you’ve got to have some great stories to tell.” you said and
        Ryan shook his head “Maybe college but none from so young. Like a friend
        locking himself in the teachers trunk.” you both laughed at that again
        “Well tell me one of your college ones.” you suggested and Ryan did just
        that. You both just talked and shared memories until the ice cream was
        long gone “Oh wow, did you see the time?” Ryan asked and you looked at
        your phone, making your eyes widen “How is it near midnight?” you asked
        totally take back “I guess the time really flies when you’re having
        fun.” Ryan commented and you agreed “We should head home, you have work
        tomorrow right?” you nodded “I do and I got to go in an hour earlier.”
        you said with a laugh starting to get up and Ryan followed with a
        chuckle “I’m so sorry.” he apologized feeling bad “No, it’s not anyone’s
        fault. I’ve had a great time, so if i wake up late, it was all worth
        it.” you said truthfully with a smile which Ryan returned “Okay, i will
        still take some responsibility.” you laughed “I guess there’s no
        convincing you?” you asked as you guys headed out and shook his head
        making you laugh more “Okay then, I’ll hold you responsible if i get
        work late tomorrow.” for some reason hearing you say that made Ryan
        happy.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        “Well, Heather, I have brought you safely back home.” Ryan said as you
        turned to unlock the door “Thank you very much. It truly is a dangerous
        world out there.” you joked and entered your apartment with Ryan
        following behind you “So did you have a good time?” you both stopped
        there near the entrance and you turned giving Ryan your attention “I had
        more than a good time. I can confidently say, that was the best first
        date I’ve ever been on and honestly, it was perfect in every way.” you
        said truthfully with a grin and Ryan was having an internal full on
        dance session but he just produced a grin matching yours. “Really?” he
        asked just to be sure and you nodded “Really Ryan, it was perfect.” you
        said coming closer to him. “Well, that means it was a great success.
        It’s gonna be hard to top the next one.” Ryan said making you chuckle
        “Well, I know you’re going to do an amazing job because I’m already
        looking forward to it.” your comment made Ryan swell with pride “Wow, so
        the pressure in on.” “Don’t over think it. We’ve known each other for
        some months and you know I’m a simple person.” you reassured him and he
        nodded “I know but that doesn’t mean you don’t deserve the best.” your
        heart immediately grew soft at that “That’s really sweet.” you said with
        a smile making Ryan a little weak because he’s come to really love your
        smiles, they’re his weakness “Yeah, anyways, it’s past midnight and you
        have work extra early in the morning, well it’s morning already.” Ryan
        rambled checking his watch “You’re right.” you said and Ryan started to
        turn but you grabbed his arm halting him “So wait, you give me a perfect
        date and you’re not going to end it with a kiss?” you asked with a tilt
        of your head and Ryan was caught off guard by your suggestion “I didn’t
        want to seem like i rushing or forcing you to do anything.” Ryan was
        actually being really sweet but you wanted to tease him a little bit “So
        you don’t actually want to kiss me then?” you asked with a confused
        expression and Ryan’s eyes widen “No, of course i want to kiss you, i
        was just being a gentlemen and taking it easy.” you grinned “So you do
        want to kiss me?” you asked coming closer and Ryan caught on coming
        closer as well. “Of course.” he said with a little nervousness looking
        down at you “Then what are you waiting for?” you asked bringing your
        hands to rest on his forearms “I didn’t ask you for permission.” he was
        just making you want to kiss him more so you nodded for him to go ahead
        “Can I kiss you, Heather?” Ryan asked looking between your lips and your
        eyes so you nodded “Yes.” you replied so Ryan brought his hand to
        capture your waist and leaned in slowly to connect his lips with yours.
        It’s cliche but there were sparks and it was perfect, just a gentle
        sweet perfect first kiss. “I think this is my new favourite thing.” Ryan
        commented still in a haze as you guys pulled away “What is?” you asked
        “Kissing you.” Ryan said making your face heat. “Can i do it again?”
        Ryan asked and you smiled but instead of giving him a reply, you kissed
        him catching him off guard but he was definitely one to not complain
        because his arms tightened around your waist.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        “You’re addicting, but i have to leave so you can sleep.” Ryan commented
        making you giggle as he opened your door getting ready to step out. “We
        could hang out tomorrow evening because i know when i come in this
        evening after work I’m going to be exhausted.” you suggested and agreed
        “Yeah, that sounds good. A simple at home date, I’m no cook, so i can
        order in?” Ryan asked with a chuckle making you laugh “That sounds
        great.” “Great, then it’s a date.” he was outside in the hallway now “Do
        you think the neighbours are going to talk?” Ryan asked looking left and
        right “What do you mean?” you were confused “That I’m leaving your
        apartment after midnight?” the look of realization crossed your face
        “Well, we both know nothing happened but let them believe what they
        want.” you smiled with a shrug and Ryan joined. “Yeah, who cares.”
        “Exactly.” “Well, i should be going, i want you to get your sleep.” you
        nodded before Ryan continued “Goodnight Heather.” Ryan said with a smile
        taking your hand in his “Well, technically it’s morning, but to end the
        date perfectly I’ll say goodnight as well, so goodnight Ryan, thank you
        for a lovely evening.” Ryan chuckled at your joke “Funny and cute.” you
        blushed at that “Leave me be and go home.” you said giving his chest a
        shove but because your hands were still connected he came right back
        “Can i get a goodbye kiss?” Ryan asked and nodded “You can.” you said
        before tip toeing to give his lips a peck and then a final kiss to his
        cheek “Scandalous. The neighbours could of saw.” Ryan said with a grin
        making you roll your eyes but there was a wide smile evident on your
        lips “Go home Ryan.” “Yes mam.” Ryan said before turning with a wave
        “Sleep well beautiful.” your eyes suddenly widened at the pet name and
        blush over took your face and all you managed to do was return a wave
        and soft “You too.” before closing the door, too stunned to speak. “Am i
        even going to get any sleep tonight.” you said before pushing yourself
        of the door.
