        To say you were miserable would be an understatement. You had given up
        on sleeping hours ago and was currently in the living room watching TV
        while snacking on hot chips. The twins are expected to come any day now,
        and the doctor recommended some things you could do to speed the process
        along and one of them were, eating spicy stuff, so hence the hot bag of
        chips. Funny enough the episode with Rachel being overdue was showing so
        you were definitely feeling her pain at that moment. Part of your misery
        came with slightly hating Ryan, and how unfair it was that he wasn’t
        going through any pain. Of course it’s all unintentional because you
        know that’s just your hormones doing the thinking for you. So with a
        sigh, you got up with the chips in hand and waddled towards the bedroom.
        Entering you went to Ryan’s side and turned on his bedside lamp making
        him stir. He settled back into bed and that wasn’t the reaction you
        wanted from him, so you flickered his light hoping to wake him up and
        you succeeded because he started stirring more. So leaving the light on
        you went back to eating your chips while looking down at him as he
        caught himself “Something wrong love?” Ryan asked squinting up at you
        and you nodded “Yeah, I’m pregnant.” you said so Ryan smiled before
        sitting up “Let me guess, it’s unfair that you’re the one suffering
        while I’m not experiencing any of the pain?” he asked with a tilt of his
        head, so you nodded “Exactly.” “And are the chips helping?” Ryan asked
        gesturing to the bag in your hands and you gave him a deadpan look “What
        do you think?” Ryan knows to be patient with you in this time and the
        irritation isn’t targeted at him so he will gladly accept any emotions
        you throw his way “I’m guessing no. You want something spicier?” Ryan
        asked pulling you to sit on the bed with him “You know what I really
        want?” you asked as Ryan took the bag from you and rest it on his
        bedside table “What do you really want beautiful, let me help?” Ryan
        asked taking your hands in his “I want to sleep, I’m tired, I want these
        babies out because I’m miserable.” you said honestly and Ryan truly felt
        for you but he felt worse because he doesn’t think he can help “Anything
        I can do?” he asked and you sighed with a shrug “I feel like Rachel from
        that episode when she was over due.” you said with a smile and Ryan
        joined you “So I guess that makes me Ross in this situation.” Ryan joked
        making you chuckle “Pretty much.” then an idea came to mind about
        something that happened in the series so you looked towards Ryan with a
        glint in your eyes and he knew you were up to something “Make love to
        me.” you said reciting Rachel’s line in the same tone she did towards
        Ross in the show and Ryan laughed “Really? How long have you been
        waiting to do that?” you laughed as well “Honestly, that just came to
        mind, because that episode was showing before I came in here.” “So, you
        really want to?” you did up your face “Honestly, I’m nowhere near in the
        mood.” “Wow, my wife just rejected having sex with me.” Ryan joked
        making you laugh “I hate you for making me laugh. I need to pee.” “I’m
        sorry.” Ryan placed a sturdy grip on your hand helping you up from the
        bedroom and escorted you to the bathroom “Oh, cook me some really spicy
        ramen, the Korean ones.” you said as you guys got to the bathroom door
        and Ryan chuckled “Yes mam.” “Thank you.” you said with a kiss to his
        lips before entering the bathroom and he disappeared to the kitchen to
        fulfill your order.

      <p class="story">
        “One bowl of very spicy ramen is served, my wife.” Ryan said placing the
        bowl in front of you with chopsticks in hand. “Thank you.” you quickly
        said grace before digging in and boy were they spicy “How is it?” Ryan
        asked and you had to give a sharp inhale before replying “Hot, very
        hot.” your nose was running and everything the more you ate. “I hope it
        works.” Ryan said before going to fill up a glass of milk for you “Skip
        the milk, and bring me ice cream instead to use once I’m finished here.”
        “Yes mam.”. Forgetting the glass he went for a bowl instead and headed
        towards the fridge. After Ryan got the ice cream, he sat with you and
        watched as you ate. “Feeling anything?” he asked as you were drinking
        the soup of the ramen that remained. “Nope.” you said with the ramen
        completely devoured now “But I’m not completely hungry anymore.” there
        was that plus you said with a sigh “So what do you want to do now?” Ryan
        asked as he admired you “I’m going to eat this ice cream and watch TV.”
        you said starting to get up with the bowl in hand “No, let me.” Ryan
        said taking the bowl from you as you guys headed towards the living room
        “Thanks.”
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        You both continued watching Friends while you ate ice cream and you
        managed to fall asleep and Ryan felt happy that you were able to get
        some rest because he knew how tired you are.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        “You really should of requested to stay home.” Ryan said as he entered
        the bedroom seeing you put on your clothes “Why would i do that? Home is
        boring and I love working.” you told him truthfully and Ryan sighed “But
        you’re tired babe.” “I know and also swollen like a whale but I prefer
        to be working because it help takes my mind off of it.” you said and
        that made Ryan smile “You really are something.” he said with a shake of
        his head making you grin “Help me with my shoes please?” you asked after
        your dress was on and Ryan nodded heading to the shoe rack “Of course,
        the black ones?” “Yes please.” with the shoes in hand, Ryan headed
        towards you. You sat on the bed to be more comfortable as Ryan put on
        your shoes for you “I miss wearing heels.” you said with a smile as Ryan
        put on your old people sandals for you. “Don’t worry, you’ll be able to
        return to them soon from now.” he said grinning up at you as he strapped
        the last shoe “Can’t wait.” you smiled at that before Ryan took hold of
        your hands helping you up to stand “Thanks.” you said and before you had
        opportunity to move off Ryan halted you and leaned over to talk to the
        twins “Be kind to mommy today okay. Be a nice boy and girl, can you guys
        do that for me please.” Ryan said rubbing your stomach making you grin
        and just at the moment, you felt your water broke “Ryan..” you said
        looking down and he stood up “Something happened?” he asked based on
        your facial expression “My water just broke.” his eyes widened the
        moment those words left your lips “Was it me?” Ryan asked and you just
        gave him a deadpan look “Are you being serious right now Ryan? We have
        to get to the hospital.” then his face entered a state of recognition
        “Right right.” then he started moving around room losing his mind “Ryan,
        the suitcase is in the closet.” you said halting his movements “Right.
        Sorry, I’m just flustered at the moment. I’m about to be a dad.” he
        paused and entered a state of thought as it all downed on him. So with a
        shake of your head, you headed over to the closet and retrieved the
        hospital suitcase you guys hand prepacked before going over to him
        “Babe.” you said resting a hand on his shoulder “Yeah, I’m about to be a
        dad.” it’s like he was stuck in a trance “I know, and it’s a amazing,
        but there’s just one problem.” “What’s that?” Ryan asked turning towards
        you “We’re still here when we should be on our way to the hospital.” the
        trance was broken and Ryan was back “Oh my, let me get the suitcase and
        leave.” you halted him and gestured to the suitcase“I already got it,
        let’s just go.” Ryan chuckled and nodded “Let’s go have twins, ready?”
        he asked and you nodded with a grin “As I’ll ever be.” with that he took
        your hand, and you both left together, knowing that when you both return
        home, you’ll have two new additions to the Wolfe family.
