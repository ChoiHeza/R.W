        “Merry! Pippin!” you called for the twins because they were outside in
        the yard and it was time for breakfast “Where are they?” Ryan asked as
        he entered the kitchen “The yard playing. Sure you’re going to be okay
        with them today?” you asked looking towards Ryan as a came next to you
        “Don’t think I’m capable?” Ryan asked with a raised brow taking hold of
        your waist from behind “I didn’t say that. I was just referring to you
        now recovering from being sick, that’s all.” he nodded with a kiss to
        your shoulder “I’m fine babe, the doctor gave me the all clear.” “Just
        making sure, don’t want you overworking yourself then getting sick
        again.” you said turning in his arms, taking hold of his face “I’m
        perfect and not only because I have this gorgeous woman in front of me.”
        you blushed at that “He must constantly flirt with me.” you smiled with
        a shake of your head “Of course.” Ryan said before connecting his lips
        with yours and that didn’t last long because you both heard the twins
        singing “Mommy and daddy sitting in the tree, K-I-S-S-I-N-G!” they sang
        making you both laugh “Go wash up kids and hurry back for breakfast
        before it gets cold.” Ryan said making them giggle and run off
        “Children.” Ryan said before pecking your lips and pulling apart. “Those
        are your children.” you said turning back to the counter making Ryan
        laugh.

        “Heather and I could do it.” Natalia suggested as the team was in a
        meeting “He only hires women of colour.” she continued, while turning to
        H “I agree, that would be a great strategy, plus you guys know the
        layout of the location really well.” Calleigh added and you both nodded
        in agreement. Horatio thought about it for a moment before asking “Are
        you guys sure about this, because you’ll be going in without comms,
        you’ll be in there on your own?” H asked you guys so you and Natalia
        shared a look and before answering with no hesitation “We’re sure.” you
        both said “We’ll have each other backs and make sure the sicko is
        stopped.” you added “Yeah, no more women deserve to fall victim to this
        man.” Natalia said next, so Horatio nodded about it “Okay, then the plan
        is set, everyone can go but you two.” Everyone else left while you two
        remained to discuss further plans about the operation.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        Natalia left first as you hang back a bit to speak with H “Ryan can’t
        know about this Lt.” he looked towards you with a smile “You know, you
        two are very similar.” you smiled at that because you know Ryan would do
        the exact same thing “We are, and we also worry the same for each other
        and the moment he finds out about this, he’ll want to put his foot down.
        But I want his mind focused on the twins today, they’re having a fun day
        out so I don’t want his mind distracted.” you told H and he nodded “I
        understand but if it does go south and the team have to get involved..”
        “Then he can know. But you assembled a team of best, so it’s going to be
        a mission success.” you said confidently and H liked that “You guys are
        the best and I believe in you all.” he said with a smile before looking
        down and getting serious “But I do know you Heather, and if the mission
        starts to go south get out of there.” H said then looked back up at you
        “But Lt, we have to stop him at all cost, no one else can die.” H sighed
        at that because he knows how dedicated you can be “And I get that, but I
        want you back alive Mrs. Wolfe.” you smiled at that “Thanks H, but you
        know I’m going to get the job done, no matter what.” H nodded “I know,
        that’s why I can’t talk you out of it, but I also know, that you won’t
        make stupid decisions either, so I trust you.” you guys shook hands on
        that “You know it H.” you guys shared a smile before leaving to get
        ready for the mission.

        “Daddy, can we surprise mommy at work?” Pippin asked Ryan as they were
        at the diner getting something to eat “You guys want to do that?” Ryan
        asked with a smile and both Pippin and Merry released toothy grins and
        nodded their heads “Yes please, I want to see mommy working.” Merry said
        making Ryan laugh “Sure we can. We can go after we’re finished eating.”
        they cheered excitedly before turning back to their food “You can give
        mommy the bracelet you bought for her.” Pippin told Merry as they
        started talking amongst themselves.

        It was an underground club that you and Natalia were currently at, and
        they do some pretty illegal stuff down there meaning, you guys couldn’t
        enter with any weapons or devices because you’re pat down before
        entering. So you guys were undercover as hookers that moves drugs for
        the clients. You guys decided that you would access his computers to get
        the needed information while she find the weapon stash to get some
        firearms for you guys. “We meet back here in 20, got it?” Natalia said
        and you nodded, so you guys fist bumped on this before separating. You
        got your task completed and got the information you needed before making
        your way back to the spot you and Natalia agreed to meet at. A little
        time passed and she didn’t show, so you know something was very wrong.
        Heading off in the direction she went, you kept your guard high as you
        investigated. Slowly entering the room, you saw Natalia was tied up but
        she hadn’t spotted you as yet because you kept hidden making sure the
        coast was clear and after it deemed fit, you headed towards her. Seeing
        you, she made a head gesture, alerting you of someone behind you.
        Sensing the person you moved in time and got into action, protecting
        yourself. The man was definitely way bigger than you but you succeeded
        none the less in taking him down, leaving him unconscious. Making sure
        the coast was clear once again you headed to Natalia and freed her “I
        got the info we needed, let’s get out of here.” “Easier said than done.”
        she said freed now with a smile. “I guess it’s a good thing we’re in
        their weapons room.”
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        Ryan arrived at the department with the twins and managed to catch Eric
        in the lobby “Uncle Eric!” the twins yelled in unison running towards
        Eric with grins on their faces and his matched theirs “Hey kids, what
        are you doing here?” he bent down to hug them both and remained stooped
        at their level to talk to them “We wanted to see mommy working.” Eric’s
        smile faltered at that but he kept a face up for the kids but Ryan
        didn’t miss that look he produced just now. “Well, mommy is very busy
        right, let me talk to daddy first, okay.” they nodded and yelled ‘okay’
        in unison, so Eric stood back up and held their hands heading over to
        Ryan as he came closer himself. “I know that look Delko.” Ryan started
        and before Delko could answer Calleigh appeared and the kids got
        distracted heading off towards her, so Calleigh immediately picked up on
        the vibe and took the kids so Eric and Ryan could talk “Heather isn’t in
        the lab, she’s out in the field.” Eric said, trying to not raise any
        suspicion “Okay, but you guys are acting as if it’s something more.”
        Ryan can sense that he’s hiding something so Eric sighed “Heather and
        Natalia went undercover to capture Rick Marlin.” “What?” Ryan asked in
        disbelief “You guys forgot how dangerous he is and the women that were
        found dead all match their descriptions, what do you mean they’re
        undercover?” Ryan asked trying his best to keep his voice calm “Because
        that’s the only way we can get them.” Eric reasoned with him “What
        happened to us slow playing it?” “You really want to know?” Eric asked
        knowing that what follows he won’t like to hear “Of course. I deserve to
        know because my wife is undercover and her life is in danger.” so Eric
        released a huge sigh “It was Heather and Natalia that suggested to take
        action because four more women were found dead this morning, the same
        way as the others. And Ryan, you know how Heather gets when woman of
        colour are the target. There’s no talking her out of it.” Ryan sighed
        because he does indeed know how you are “I know…” at the same time Ryan
        looked towards his daughter “And the fact we have a daughter now and
        she’s of colour, Heather isn’t going back down on these things as easily
        as before.” “That’s the same thing she told me this morning.” Eric said
        and he could see that Ryan was very worried “Heather is one of the best,
        they’ll get the job done and come home, don’t worry about it.” he said
        resting a hand on Ryan’s shoulder “Mind filling me on the mission.” Ryan
        suggested “You sure?” Ryan nodded before going towards Calleigh “Can you
        keep an eye on them for me please?” “Of course. You guys want to hang
        out with me for a little bit.” the twins cheered in agreement before
        heading of with her “Let’s go meet H.” Eric said before he and Ryan
        headed off.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        “This is bad.” you voiced as you and Natalia were cornered in a room,
        trying to think up of a solution “First, we gotta find a way to contact
        the team, we need reinforcements.” she said before looking towards your
        legs “How is it?” you looked downwards as well, seeing the makeshift
        bandage you guys assemble on your thigh, around the gunshot wound.
        “Still hurts like shit but I’ll survive.” you still chuckle none the
        less and Natalia smiled at that to know that you were in good spirits.
        “Thanks again for that, I owe you.” you waved her off “No need, because
        you would of done the same thing for me.” “I know but still, I feel bad,
        I should of seen him in time.” “Girl shush. How about this, when we get
        out of here, you treat me to ice cream.” she chuckled at that “I think I
        can do better than ice cream but you got it.” “Good, now, communication.
        We need to find a way.” “Leave that to me, just focus on your leg for
        now.” you nodded
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        “No comms?!” Ryan asked not liking how this mission sounded “You know he
        searches all of his women, so we didn’t want to risk anything.” Delko
        told him “This just has bad news written all over it.” Ryan stated
        running a hand over his face “Come on, have some faith. This is Heather
        and Natalia we’re talking about, they’ve got this.” just that moment H
        barged into the room “We gotta go, they need back up.” “You were
        saying.” Ryan said to Eric as they rushed out the room with H.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        “Okay, we gotta hold out for ten minutes. Think you can do that?”
        Natalia asked and you nodded “Yeah, that see-” you were cut off by a
        voice entering the room, so you and Natalia made yourself smaller behind
        the boxes you guys were currently behind. “I know you ladies are in
        here, and one of you are bleeding out. How long do you guys think you
        have, you need medical attention, so come out and we can help you.” you
        guys heard the guy loud enough for you both to hear so you guys shared a
        look and remained quiet coming up with a stealth plan to take him down.
        With some hand gestures you guys knew what to do and got into action.
        Natalia was going to distract the guy while you take him down from
        behind. She quietly moved to a small corner and made a noise to pull him
        that direction. So ignoring the pain in your leg, you quietly moved
        behind the guy with your gun in hand, just waiting for the perfect
        moment to strike. “I heard you.” he said moving towards Natalia’s
        position, so with this chance you reached up and hit him in the back of
        his neck making his body drop quickly going unconscious “Clear.” you
        whispered and Natalia stood up “You good?” she asked coming towards and
        you nodded before grabbing your leg. “Good job.” she said and you guys
        shared a high hive. “Look at us.” you both chuckled at that not
        believing at the situation you guys are caught in.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        Ryan headed off with the team, while Calleigh stayed behind with the
        twins. Arriving at the compound, the front armed guys went in first guns
        blazing, clearing the area before the team entered and they began to
        search for you guys. “Anything?” Eric asked meeting up with the others
        and they shook their head then Ryan remembered your necklace “Was
        Heather wearing her necklace when she went undercover?” Ryan asked and
        Eric and H shared a look “She left it behind, she didn’t want to risk
        anything.” Eric said with a shake of his head and Ryan sighed “They’ve
        got to be here.” just then one of the officers shouted “Lt!” everyone
        headed his direction “What is it?” H said approaching “We’ve found a
        hatch, but it’s been recently welded shut.” the officer pointed out so
        Ryan and Eric went in closer to inspect “Bring the thermal imager!” H
        called out and someone wasted no time in handing it to H “Step aside.”
        he instructed and everyone cleared the door. With the device in hand,
        Horatio pointed it at the door and turned it on. Inspecting the area,
        the device detected three heat signatures. “We’ve got three live ones.”
        H yelled so someone came with the right equipment to open the hatch.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        “It could be the team” you said as both you and Natalia heard noise
        coming from the hatch door “Could be or could be his men.” Natalia said
        gesturing towards Rick, you guys managed to capture him and had him
        unconscious down here with you two, while waiting it out for the team.
        “Either way, let’s be ready” you said and she nodded at that, so with
        guns up, you guys moved to the back out of eye shot of whoever may
        enter. You guys left Rick where he was because he would take to long to
        move. The hatch was opened and light entered so you guys shared a look
        and a nod before looking back at the entrance and foot steps came down
        the ladder “Miami Dade!” came the voice and immediately, both you and
        Natalia released a breathe of relief “H!” you guys shouted with smiles
        coming out of hiding “Ms Boa-Vista, Mrs. Wolfe, you guys okay?” he asked
        coming further and finally seeing you two “We’re good.” Natalia replied
        “They’re down here.” he called up to the team and the others wasted no
        time in coming down “We’re better than good Lt.” you said before
        pointing towards an unconscious Rick Marlin and H followed the line of
        sight and a smile appeared on his face “You guys did it.” you nodded “I
        promised we would sir.” you confirmed just then came Ryan’s voice
        “Heather!” in an instant he was in front of you “What are you doing
        here? I thought you were with the twins?” he engulfed you in a hug “Long
        story. Are you hurt?” Ryan asked inspecting your face then you
        remembered your injured leg “Oh yeah, I got shot in the leg.” you said
        with a chuckle now remembering so Ryan pulled away to look down “You
        can’t be serious.” Ryan said giving you a deadpan look so you returned a
        shy smile
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        “How is it that you forgot about getting shot in your leg?” Ryan asked
        as he sat by your side of the hospital bed after you were just brought
        in from surgery “The adrenaline was running through me and hearing the
        team just gave me a sense of relief that i forgot about it.” you said
        truthfully and Ryan just released a sigh “So tell me, how did you find
        out about it, the operation?” you asked curious so Ryan leaned forward
        and took your hand in his before continuing “The twins wanted to see you
        work, so i brought them by the station, and that’s how i found out. Eric
        wasn’t going to tell me anything, but i knew he was hiding something so
        he spilled.” you rolled your eyes at that “Damn Eric.” you scolded “But
        seriously Heather, were you not going to tell me?” Ryan asked making you
        sigh “Well, the operation was a last minute thing that Nat and I came up
        with this morning, and i know if i told you about it, you would of
        straight up said no, so that’s why i took the opportunity while you were
        at home.” “But-” you cut him off “Before you argue with me, i am aware
        that I’m a mother of two, and a wife so i just can’t be taking dangerous
        jobs like this and i get that but, after hearing four other women were
        found dead this morning, i was like this man has to be stopped.” Ryan
        completely understood where you were coming from “I understand.” he said
        “I know, you’re mad and you won’t understa-, wait, did you just say you
        understood?” you asked completely taken by surprise and he nodded “Yeah,
        the man was targeting women of colour and you being a woman of colour
        with the power to do something, you couldn’t just sit back and let him
        get away.” Ryan said making you speechless because he actually
        understood “And also, we have a little girl of colour so that makes her
        a target as well, well not now, but for the future, so yeah, I’m not
        mad, i understand. i just, wish you told me so i could prepare for it
        and i also understand why you didn’t tell me soooooo….” Ryan said with a
        smile squeezing your hand making you return his smile “In the future, I
        will tell you and I will get you involved instead of going off on my
        own.” “Thank you, because I’ve come to realized, with situations like
        these, it’s hard to talk you out of them, even if knowing you aren’t
        going to make it out.” Ryan said with a heavy heart “But i will always
        come back, maybe just not how i entered” you said referring to your leg
        with a smile and there was a pause before Ryan spoke again “Pain meds
        kicked in?” Ryan asked looking at it as well and you nodded “How did you
        get it?” “A guy pointed a gun a Natalia and she didn’t see him in time,
        so i moved in front of her to take the shot.” you said and Ryan’s eyes
        widened “Really?” you nodded “She would of done the same thing for me.”
        “I know but still, that’s impressive.” you waved your hand at that to
        dismiss him “Just doing my job.” “Okay CSI Wolfe.” Ryan said with a
        chuckle “I miss my children.” you said with a sigh, giving Ryan a sad
        smile “Well, they’re with my mom and they should be asleep by now
        because they were trying to wait up to visit you after the surgery but
        it took longer than expected so they’ll come by tomorrow.” Ryan told you
        “Are they okay? What did you tell them?” “Surprisingly, they took it
        really well. They think you’re a superhero for taking down the bad guy
        and the fact you got injured is super cool.” you laughed at that “I’m
        cool now for getting hurt?” you asked and Ryan nodded “You sugar coated
        it right?” and Ryan shook his head “I told them the truth, mommy went
        undercover and took down the bad guy and got injured in the process but
        she’s doing okay.” your heart softened at that “Aww, thank you Ryan.”
        “For what?” Ryan asked with a tilt of his head “For making me sound
        cool.” “Nah, you did that all by yourself beautiful. You are cool. You
        took down a most wanted man, just you and Natalia took down his whole
        operation while saving plenty of women in the process. The kids weren’t
        lying when they said you were a superhero.” you grinned at that and
        tears slowly came to your eyes “Don’t make me cry.” that made Ryan laugh
        at you before standing up to kiss your tears away “Well, get used to
        it.” Ryan said making you chuckle.
