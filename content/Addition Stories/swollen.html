        You called in sick today because you woke up feeling pretty down and
        depressed. Ryan offered to stay home with you but you told him that
        you’ll be fine. When in reality you are not actually fine. It’s like
        when you woke up this morning, the hormones chose death and just decided
        to play on all your negative thoughts. You spent majority of your
        morning standing in front the mirror looking at your appearance and
        body, realizing that you’ve gain some weight. And right now it all made
        you feel uncomfortable and you hated it. What upset you even more was
        that you couldn’t wear your wedding bands anymore. You woke in the
        middle of the night realizing it started to feel uncomfortable so you
        took it off not paying much attention to it because you were very tired.
        So waking up this morning, when you decided to put back on the ring, you
        realized it wasn’t going on so that started off your spiral and you made
        sure to hide all these emotions from Ryan because a part of you didn’t
        want Ryan to see you like this.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        Ryan was still in the parking garage wrapped up in worry for you because
        he noticed your behavior this morning although you tried to hide it from
        him. He can’t find it in his heart to leave knowing the state that
        you’re in, well he actually doesn’t even know what’s happening because
        you’ve never been like this towards him before. “What to do?” he asked
        himself out loud then his mom popped into his mind so he wasted no time
        in contacting his mom. “Ryan?” came his mom’s voice in a question as she
        answered the video call because it is very odd to be hearing from him
        this time in the morning “Yes mom, it’s me.” “Is something wrong?” Ryan
        released a sigh “Yeah, something is and I don’t know what to do.” “Is it
        the twins, is it Heather?” “It’s Heather. She’s acting weird.” his mom
        entered a state of confusion “Weird how?” then Ryan got into explaining
        your behaviors from this morning “She wouldn’t let me touch her, all her
        smiles were fake, she kept hiding herself from me and she wasn’t even
        wearing her wedding bands. Is she mad at me? Did I do something wrong? I
        truly don’t know what’s going on.” Ryan released a huge sigh at the end
        of his ranting and his mom just chuckled and shook her head “How are you
        laughing? Do you not see me panicking?” “Okay Ryan, calm down. You did
        nothing wrong, trust me and no she isn’t mad at you.” his mom said
        hoping to calm him down “Then what is going on? Please help me
        understand.” “This is a phase that most first time pregnant women go
        through. It’s mostly the hormones that affects the brain and can make us
        enter a state of depression and feeling completely down. But have you
        realized that she has gained weight?” his mom asked and Ryan nodded
        “Then that means she has noticed it too and it’s very obvious to her.
        She’s just not feeling happy in her body and probably thinking that you
        won’t find her beautiful.” “But that’s not true.” Ryan protest and she
        nodded “We both know that but she’s not thinking that right now.” “So I
        shouldn’t give her space?” Ryan questioned and his mom and she shook her
        head before replying “No, she just needs reassurance. She’ll fight it
        but just be patient and keep reassuring her.” “Okay. I can do that. I’ll
        just call in sick and spend the day with her.” “Please, she needs it.”
        “Thanks mom. I’ll call you later and let you know how it goes.”

        You were currently in bed watching Friends hoping it would help you
        cheer up but not even that was helping. Just as you were about to change
        the episode, you heard Ryan’s voice “Beautiful?” “What is he doing
        home?” you whispered to yourself quickly getting up. So you wiped the
        tears from your eyes and headed for the bathroom locking the door.
        “Heather?” Ryan called out again but this time you heard his voice in
        the bedroom. So clearing your voice you called out “Bathroom.” you
        replied back so Ryan walked towards the door and turned the knob but it
        was locked which is weird behaviour because you guys never lock the
        bathroom door but Ryan remembered what his mom told him “Why are you
        home?” you asked trying your best to hide the fact you were crying but
        Ryan picked up on it “Decided not to go in today but instead spend the
        day with my gorgeous pregnant wife.” Ryan said and that brought tears to
        your eyes “I’m not gorgeous anymore.” you said with a sniffle and Ryan’s
        heart shattered at that “What are you talking about babe? Since you
        became pregnant, you’ve gotten even more gorgeous.” he said and you
        shook your head although he can’t see you “You’re just saying that to
        make me feel better.” “No baby, I’m speaking the truth. I mean it. So
        can you please open the door?” Ryan said giving it a tap “No! I’m
        hideous, I don’t want you to see me.” you were full on crying now and
        Ryan felt completely helpless and was hurting because he truly didn’t
        know what to do “Who told you that? That you’re hideous?” Ryan asked
        trying to find a way to help “No one need to tell me for me to not see
        for myself.” “Then that means you’re not hideous. I saw you this morning
        and you were the same beautiful woman that i married ten years ago, if
        not, even more beautiful. So please open the door so that i can tell you
        that to your face.” you cried even more “That’s not true. I’ve gotten
        fat. I can’t even wear my rings anymore.” Ryan sighed and looked across
        to your night stand and saw your wedding bands laying there “Remember
        when I was getting chubby and i was worried that you wouldn’t find me
        attractive anymore?” “Yeah?” “But you proved to me otherwise right?” “I
        did, because I would find you attractive no matter what.” Ryan started
        to smile “Exactly and this is the same exact thing because guess what,
        no matter how big you get, I will still love you the same and I would
        still be very much attracted to you.” you listened to his words as your
        cries lessened “Even when I become a whale?” you asked and Ryan grinned
        “Yes, even ‘if’ you become a whale.” Ryan replied and you somewhat felt
        better but it still wasn’t enough “How would I know that you won’t go
        back on your word?” at that Ryan started reciting your wedding vows,
        then he added “Also, I can go tomorrow and get the your bands resized,
        so that you’ll be able to wear them.” that brought a smile to your face
        and your heart lightened “You mean that?” “Every word Mrs. Wolfe.” from
        outside, Ryan could hear you moving and then he heard the lock clicked
        letting him know you unlocked the door. So instead of opening it, he
        waited for you to do that. Slowly you turned the handle and opened the
        door a smidge peeping outside to see Ryan standing right there with a
        smile on his face.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        Seeing your face peep through the crack with red swollen eyes from
        crying broke Ryan’s heart and he just wanted to hold you and take all
        your pain away “There she is, my beautiful wife.” Ryan said with a grin
        making you somewhat smile. So you opened the door more and slowly exited
        “Sorry.” were the first words out your mouth when you came out so Ryan
        shook his head “No. Never apologize for that. Your body is changing and
        that’s normal so no need to feel sorry.” Ryan said moving slowly towards
        you “You meant everything that you said?” you asked once again but this
        time looking Ryan in the face to see his genuine reactions “Every.
        Single. Word.” Ryan said with each step before he stop right in front of
        you “May I?” he asked, gesturing to hold your face and you nodded “There
        is no way in this world that you could look, that would ever make me
        stop loving you because you will still be the most beautiful woman in my
        eyes.” Ryan said before placing a gentle kiss to your forehead “I love
        you Heather, with my every being, and I mean that.” Ryan said sincerely
        and you could tell he mean every word so that once again brought tears
        to your eyes but it was happy tears this time “No no, why are you
        crying?” Ryan said instantly worried wiping your tears away “Don’t
        worry. Happy tears this time.” you reassured so Ryan chuckled “So cute.”
        he said before kissing your tears away.

        Let’s just say the cry session left you with a headache and made you
        sleepy so that’s where you were currently, in bed literally sleeping
        your troubles away. Ryan took this opportunity to go to the jewelers and
        get you wedding bands resized. Ryan explained the situation to the lady
        and she was more than happy to help “Do you have her current size?” Ryan
        nodded because he made sure to measure your finger while you were
        sleeping. Giving the lady your information she got to work. After
        getting your rings done, he decided also to go and buy your current
        cravings to help cheer you up.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        “I hope she’s still asleep.” Ryan said to himself as he entered back the
        house. Resting the food in the kitchen, he headed towards the bedroom
        with the ring box in head. Entering, he rejoiced internally because you
        were still asleep. Going over to you, he gently sat on the bed and
        opened the box revealing the resized wedding bands, so taking them out
        he slowly brought them to your hand and slid them on your finger and
        they fit perfectly. He knows this is going to make you very happy when
        you wake up.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        When you woke up, you found Ryan laying with you watching TV and your
        heart softened at that, thankful that he decided to stay home with you
        as much as you wouldn’t like to admit it. Ryan felt you move, so he
        looked across to find you awake and staring at your finger that held the
        ring and that brought a smile to his face. You were absolutely touched
        looking at the ring because you knew Ryan probably went and got it
        resized while you were sleeping. You were so caught up in your little
        world that you didn’t even realize Ryan was watching and admiring you.
        “You like it?” Ryan asked catching you off guard making you look up at
        him with a smile “I love it, thank you.” Ryan smiled at that before
        leaning forward to give your forehead a kiss “How are you feeling?” Ryan
        asked as he leaned back “Honestly, hungry.” you said with a grin making
        Ryan chuckle as you rubbed your stomach “Well, I brought you home some
        of your current cravings.” Ryan said sitting up, to help you up making
        your face lit up and he nodded “Of course, want me to go and heat it
        up?” “Yes please. I’ll go shower in the meantime.” “You got it
        beautiful. Let me know if you need help with anything.” you nodded as he
        left you at the bathroom door before leaving the bedroom.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        Ryan was finished in the kitchen and was heading back towards the
        bedroom to see if you were finished. “Heather?” Ryan called out when he
        realized you weren’t there “Bathroom.” he heard you so reaching the door
        and twisting the handle he was happy to find out that the door wasn’t
        locked this time. Entering he saw you staring at your naked body in the
        mirror, inspecting it very closer “Everything okay hun?” Ryan asked
        watching you from a distance and you nodded before turning to look at
        him “Yeah, I’m just looking.” you said with a smile so he made his way
        closer towards you “Only looking and no negative thoughts?” Ryan asked
        coming to stand behind you so you shook your head in reply while giving
        him a smile in the mirror “Sure sure?” “I’m sure sure. I do look
        different but i don’t hate myself anymore.” Ryan smiled at that “Not
        different, more beautiful.” Ryan said leaning down to place kisses along
        your shoulder making you smile wider “So I’ve been told.” Ryan chuckled
        “Well, you got to believe it yourself as well.”
