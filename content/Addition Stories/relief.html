        “Beautiful?” came Ryan’s voice as he entered the bedroom to find you
        laying down watching TV. “Yes?” Ryan came next to you and sat on the bed
        and he was giving you a weird smile “Why are you being so weird Ryan?”
        you asked him with a raised brow “Well, I just came from reading an
        article about something and I want to try it out.” you gave him your
        full attention now “Is it something weird?” you asked skeptical and Ryan
        chuckled before shaking his head and reaching out his hand for you to
        take “Trust me.” you looked at him and then his hand and back to him
        before giving in “Okay Mr. Wolfe.” you said as he helped you up and you
        both stood face each other “Okay, ready?” he asked and you shrugged “I
        don’t even know what I’m supposed to be ready for.” Ryan grinned before
        moving to go behind you and you saw his hands came around your waist
        going below your pregnant stomach “The article said that it feels good
        when a woman’s pregnant belly is lifted so I wanted to try with you.”
        you smiled liking the sound of that “Okay then, what are you waiting
        for?” Ryan chuckled before getting into action. He lowered himself and
        clasped his fingers under your stomach “Ready?” he asked and you nodded
        and just like that he lifted and boy did you suddenly feel amazing. You
        released a major sigh of relief that you didn’t know you were craving
        “How does it feel?” Ryan asked as he felt your body caved against his
        “Like I’m not pregnant and a thousand pounds lighter.” he could
        practically hear the smile in your voice “They are heavy.” he said
        feeling the weight for himself “You have no idea. Please carry them for
        the rest of the pregnancy.” you said with a plea making Ryan chuckle
        “Baby, if I could, I would.” “Just a little longer.” “You got it hun.”
        You guys stayed like that for almost eight minutes because Ryan
        eventually got tired in this position “Okay babe, I’m letting go now.”
        you nodded and he slowly released your belly allowing the weight to fall
        back to you “Ugh I hate this.” you whined immediately missing the light
        weight feeling as you carefully lowered yourself back to the bed “I’m
        sorry.” Ryan said joining you but you paid him no mind and laid down
        going back to watching TV “Ice cream?” Ryan asked hoping to make you
        feel better and you nodded, so Ryan gave your forehead a kiss before
        disappearing from the bedroom.

        “I’m sorry.” Ryan said as he laid next to you while rubbing your belly
        “What for?” you asked as you were focused on TV and and eating your ice
        cream “Not being able to help you carry the twins.” “It’s okay you know
        Ryan, I’ve been doing it for eight months now.” you said with a chuckle
        before continuing “And when they’re born, it’s gonna be your turn to
        carry them.” you told him with a raised brow making him turn to look at
        you with a smile “I won’t mind one bit.” he said, his smile widening to
        a grin, then he entered into a state thought with a joyful look in his
        eyes “I can’t wait till they’re here.” Ryan said referring to the twins
        as he kissed your stomach. “Daddy can’t wait to meet you.” Ryan mumbled
        against your stomach making you go soft and smile at him.
