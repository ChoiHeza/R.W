        “Good morning.” you greeted Ryan when you entered the kitchen seeing him
        there preparing breakfast “Good morning beautiful.” Ryan turned greeting
        you back with a smile “Why didn’t you wake me?” you asked Ryan as you
        approached him and hugged him from behind “Because you were sick last
        night and figured you needed the extra sleep.” you grew soft at that
        “Thank you baby.” you said giving his back a kiss “Always. I even ironed
        our clothes already.” that made you move around him going to his side
        “You did?” you asked looking up at Ryan making him look down at you “I
        did.” with the state you’re in, his reply brought tears to your eyes and
        Ryan chuckled “Babe, why are you crying?” “It’s the hormones. I’m still
        adjusting and plus that’s a really sweet gesture.” you told him and Ryan
        paused what he was doing to turn fully facing you. “You’re cute.” Ryan
        said taking your face into his hands and leaning down to give you a kiss
        before kissing your tears away.

        “Good morning everyone.” H said entering the conference room. He wanted
        to hold a meeting with the CSI team first thing that morning. You all
        greeted him back “We have an important case to work on today. Mr. and
        Mrs. Hugo, the couple that abducts other couples and tortures them
        before killing them.” H started before going more into detail. “So
        what’s the plan then H?” Eric asked “We would like to send you and
        Heather undercover as a married couple, because you two fit the
        description best and you both are best for the job.” “Let me guess,
        there’s something to hack?” you asked with a smile and H nodded “We were
        given blueprints of the possible warehouse where they keep their
        victims. And they keep their warehouse under surveillance, so we need
        you to access their home computer and get that footage.” you nodded
        understanding “Easier said than done.” you felt Ryan’s hand moved under
        the table to grip yours because he’s never a fan whenever you have to go
        undercover and if it’s not with him. “We’ll have Ryan and Natalia on
        comms. And Walter and Calleigh, there is something else I need you guys
        to work on. So you two are dismissed for now.” H gave everyone their
        tasks
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        You four stayed back and looked over the undercover assignment “I could
        pass for an Adam.” Eric commented while looking over the file seeing his
        undercover name “Weirdly enough I could see it.” you said with a smile
        towards his direction. While you and Eric read through the files,
        Natalia and Ryan were working with the equipment making sure everything
        was properly set up “So we’re Mr. and Mrs. Greaves.” Eric said making
        you laugh “This is going to be fun.” Eric laughed at that “You just love
        going undercover don’t you?” you rapidly nodded at that “It’s fun and
        plus when we take down the bad guys, it’s rewarding.” Eric nodded
        agreeing with you, then he looked across to Natalia and Ryan to see they
        were caught up in what they were doing so he leaned in closer towards
        you “Is Ryan going to be okay with this?” Eric asked “What do you mean?
        Us being a married couple?” you asked and Eric shook his head “No, you
        being pregnant and making yourself a target?” his question made you
        enter a state of thought because you didn’t think about that “Honestly,
        I don’t know because he hasn’t said anything.” “Talk to him.” Eric
        suggested “I will, after we’ve got our stories covered.”.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        With your undercover clothes on, both you and Eric were with Natalia and
        Ryan as they hooked you up with communication devices. Ryan was helping
        you with yours and since you guys were a little distance away, you
        decided to talk with him “Are you okay?” you asked Ryan and that made
        him pause to look up at you “About you going undercover?” he asked and
        you nodded “Honestly, surprisingly I’m okay.” Ryan said with a smile
        making you not expecting his answer “Really?” you asked and he nodded
        “Even though I’m pregnant?” you asked and he halted again meeting your
        eyes “Well, I’m choosing not to think about that part, because you’ll be
        with Delko and I’m sure he won’t let anything happen to you. Plus I know
        you’ll be extra careful.” Ryan said but mostly to settle his heart “I
        will be.” you both shared a smile before Ryan continued his work “So me
        and Eric being a couple, you’re okay with that?” you asked and Ryan
        chuckled “Yes baby, I’m okay with that and I’ll try my best to not get
        jealous and constantly remind myself that you guys are just working.”
        you laughed at that “This going to be interesting to see.”
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        “How twisted is this.” you said as you and Eric made your way to the
        couples house because they were hosting a married couple restoration
        dinner party and that’s how you guys managed to get invited “What do you
        mean?” Eric asked “Hosting a dinner party just to pick out their next
        victims.” “I guess they take their killings very serious.” “Okay
        husband, let’s do this.” you said reaching out your hand for Eric to
        take and he intertwined his fingers with yours “Okay, we read you.” Ryan
        said thinking you meant him “Sorry real husband, I meant fake husband.”
        you said with a sorrowful smile “It’s okay.” Ryan replied. You and Eric
        shared a nod before entering the state of being a lovely couple.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        “You guys are such a gorgeous couple and your wife is so beautiful.”
        Mrs. Hugo told you both as you guys were talking with the murder couple
        “Thank you and she really is.” Eric said before giving your temple a
        kiss making you smile “So what’s your secret?” the wife asked you
        “Secret for what?” you asked confused “To be so beautiful because
        honestly, if i wasn’t married to this guy, you definitely would be my
        type.” she told you making you chuckle. “I think they’ve found their
        next couple kidnap.” Natalia said towards Ryan as they were listening in
        “I guess H was correct about them matching the description well.” Ryan
        voiced. “And you’re pregnant, how long?” the wife asked you “Four
        months.” you told her with a grin while running a hand along your
        stomach “Four months and this size already?” she asked and you chuckled
        “It’s twins.” and then she understood “Aww, that’s so sweet,
        congratulations.” “Thanks.” both you and Eric replied “Adam, there is
        something I would like to show you, if you don’t mind.” the husband
        gestured towards Eric “Guys, do not separate, that’s what they want.”
        came Natalia’s voice through the comms “Can I bring my wife along with
        me, because since she’s gotten pregnant, I’ve had separation issues.”
        Eric said coming up with that on the spot “Well, it’s really just a guy
        thing that we do here, with the husbands only. The wives can’t be let in
        on it, even my wife doesn’t know about it.” Mr. Hugo told you guys so
        you reached up and took hold of Eric’s bicep “It’s okay love, I have to
        go use the ladies room anyway, you know how the twins are.” you told him
        before looking to the couple “They think my bladder is a squeeze toy.”
        you said with a small laugh “Are you sure?” Eric asked you and you knew
        it was the real him asking and you nodded “Of course, I’ll be fine. I’m
        perfectly safe in this home.” you said and the wife came next to you
        “You have nothing to worry about Adam, I’ll make sure to keep an eye on
        your wife for you.” Mrs. Hugo said so Eric nodded “Okay then, Mr. Hugo,
        you can lead the way.” Eric said before leaving with him and the wife
        took you by hand “I’ll show you were the bathroom is.”
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        In a van parked near the house Ryan and Natalia shared a look “They just
        disregard everything I just said.” Natalia said with a sigh “I just
        think they don’t want to get caught, but they’ll be fine and this maybe
        the opportunity that Heather needs to get the information.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        “Babe, talk to me, where are you?” Ryan asked you “Still in the
        bathroom. She took me to the bathroom in their home office which is
        perfect.” you said peeping out through the door making sure the room is
        still empty “And where is she?” Ryan asked concerned “I told her need
        some herbal that helps soothes with the pregnancy so she said she’ll
        personally make it herself for me.” you said quickly exiting the
        bathroom and heading over to the computer to quickly get to work “You’re
        not drinking that.” Ryan warned “You don’t have to tell me twice. Now
        shush as I focus on accessing their system. “Yes mam.”
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        You made quick work and copied their whole drive to your own and made
        sure to delete any traces of you accessing their system. “All done.” you
        said putting your drive back in your bag and headed for the sofa to lay
        down “Now all to do is lay down and pretend to not feeling well for when
        she comes back.” “Smart.” Natalia said. It wasn’t long before Mrs. Hugo
        returned with the tea in hand and saw you in the state you were in “Oh
        my, are you okay?” she asked resting down the tea and headed over to you
        “Not really, some days I just get this really sick feeling, that’s why I
        asked for the tea.” you mentioned sitting up so she brought the tea for
        you to drink “Don’t drink that babe.” Ryan warned again “Thank you.” you
        said taking it from her and giving it a smell with a contented sigh for
        show “Smells perfect, would you mind getting my husband for me?” you
        said bringing the cup to your lips and she nodded “Of course.” she said
        with a smile and got up leaving the office. So with the tea that was in
        your mouth you spat it back into the cup and poured majority of it into
        a nearby plant and sat the cup back on the coffee table. “Don’t worry, I
        didn’t drink the tea, I dumped it.” “Good girl.” Ryan replied making you
        giggle and Natalia rolled her eyes at you two “I’m right here guys.”
        “Sorry.” you apologized and Ryan turned to her “I’m not sorry for what I
        said.” you just shook your head at that because Ryan was just being
        Ryan.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        “Hey hun, is everything okay?” Eric asked as he entered the office so
        you moved from your laying position and sat up for show “Just feeling
        sick, but the tea helped somewhat.” you told him as he came next to you
        and Mrs. Hugo looked on “Do you want to leave, we can do that?” Eric
        asked and you nodded “I would like that. I just think I need to go home
        and lay down.” you told him and he looked towards the wife “Would it be
        okay if we left early, my wife isn’t feeling well I would really like to
        take her home?” Eric asked her and she nodded coming closer “Of course,
        we have your contact info so we’ll keep in touch because we gotta invite
        you guys over for the final dinner party.” she said understanding “Of
        course we’ll be there.” you said with a smile as Eric helped you stand
        up. “And thank you so much for having us over.” you said as Eric kept an
        arm around your waist “It was our pleasure Mr. and Mrs. Greaves.” with
        that the couple escorted you and Eric out.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        Keeping the facade, you and Eric walked hand in hand towards the car you
        guys arrived in “Let’s get out here.” Eric said and you nodded feeling
        good that it was a mission success. “We’ll meet you guys back at the
        lab.” you heard Ryan say “You got it, see you guys there.” Arriving at
        the car, you both got in and the moment the door was closed you removed
        your ear piece enjoying the freeing feeling and the mic followed next
        “Are you actually feeling sick?” Eric asked with a little concern laced
        in his voice and on his face “I am honestly perfectly fine.” you replied
        making Eric laugh “Then that was perfectly good acting, because for a
        moment i thought you were actually sick.” “Well, I’m just that great an
        actor.” you said making a gestures and with that, Eric drove off heading
        back to the lab.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        “There is the Greaves couple!” Natalia announced as you entered your lab
        seeing her and Ryan there. You and Eric stopped and posed for her before
        laughing “That was truly fun.” you said as you guys joined the rest at
        your desk “You guys make a really cute couple.” Natalia commented and
        that made Ryan cleared his throat making you all look towards him “What
        did you get Heather?” came H’s voice as he entered the lab taking all
        your attention away from Ryan “I’ve managed to copy their whole drive so
        I was just about to take a look at it.” you told H holding up the drive
        in hand “Okay good, let me know what you find. Eric, Ms Boa Vista, with
        me.” H said before leaving and the others nodded following him leaving
        you and Ryan in the lab. “What’s wrong?” you asked turning to Ryan while
        hooking up the drive “What do you mean?” he asked avoiding your gaze and
        looked at what you were doing as if it was the most interesting thing
        “Come on Ryan, did the mission bother you?” he took a sigh before
        looking towards you making you pause “At first, i was worried for your
        safety and the twins but then that left when i knew you were in good
        hands with Eric.” Ryan started so you showed that you were paying
        attention for him to continue “Then you guys kept getting compliments on
        how gorgeous you guys are today and how perfect you both look together
        and i hate to admit it but you guys actually do look really nice
        together.” Ryan voiced honestly and you weren’t sure how to reply, so
        you started by raising your hand to take his in yours “As good as th-”
        you were cut off by Ryan’s phone beeping “It’s Tom, he needs me in the
        morgue.” Ryan said looking at his phone so you nodded “Well continue
        this talk later, i love you.” you told him with a smile and he nodded
        returning your smile “Okay, and i love you.” you guys shared a hand
        squeeze before Ryan left. So with a sigh, you returned back to work.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        With the day over, you found the info you needed and it was more than
        enough evidence to arrest the couple for the kidnappings and murders and
        boy was it an amazing feeling to get people like that off the street.
        You and Ryan just stepped through the front door and he was quiet the
        whole way home and deep down you have a feeling why but for now you’ll
        just let him be in thoughts before you settle them for him. “You can go
        and shower while i heat up dinner.” Ryan said as he headed towards the
        kitchen not even looking back or waiting for a reply so you played along
        for now and did as suggested. While stepping out the shower you saw Ryan
        was standing in front the bathroom sink looking in the mirror. Making
        sure your feet was dry you headed over towards Ryan because you think
        it’s time “Hello love.” you said coming next to him and leaning your
        head on his shoulder as his eyes met your in the mirror “Hey.” “I know
        it’s still bothering you because you barely spoke to me.” you said and
        Ryan sighed “I’m not mad at you, I’m just, i don’t know.” you understood
        him “You’re thinking about me and Eric as a couple.” you asked him and
        he nodded looking back at himself “Well, as fun as today was, and as
        much as people say what a beautiful couple we make, that makes me feel
        good but not for the reasons you’re thinking about, but that meant we
        were good at our job today and was never suspected to be anything but.”
        you started and Ryan rolled his eyes “Thanks for making me feel better
        Heather.” Ryan said sarcastically making you reached up to hit his lower
        back before wrapping that arm around his waist. “You want to know why we
        were so believable and good as a couple?” you asked “Sure, please do
        tell.” Ryan said with a little annoyance so ignoring it, you answered
        him “Because Delko pretended to be you.” you said and that made Ryan
        look back at you in the mirror with confusion written on his features
        “What do you mean?” “Eric told me that he was only able to pull off
        being my husband was by acting and behaving how you would with me or how
        he thought you would be around me. He just pretended to be you. So what
        people saw today was a reflection of the real thing, and if being so
        fake looked nice, imagine if that couple saw the real thing.” you said
        with a smile and that made Ryan smile “Because you know what i think, we
        look pretty amazing together.” you said referring to both your
        reflections in the mirror “Don’t you think so, and who cares what people
        thinks, it’s what we think that matters.” you said hoping to reassure
        him “You’re right.” Ryan said feeling better “And also, last time i
        checked my name was Heather Wolfe.” you said looking up at him now with
        a grin “You are.” he said looking down at you “And I wouldn’t want to be
        with anyone else.” you said making Ryan chuckle “Thank goodness.” he
        said before connecting both of your lips.
