            You were both getting ready work "Don't forget I'm taking my car today." you said exiting the bathroom to the bedroom seeing Ryan on the bed putting on his socks "You know I don't mind taking you." Ryan said looking up at you "I know you don't but I also have to go by the office today. There's supposed to be a meeting about a new project they want me to lead." you said coming over to Ryan, a smile gracing his lips with pride "Look at my wife, a very busy working woman. It's a nice look on you." Ryan said pulling you to stand between his legs, hands going to the back of your thighs while yours went to his shoulders "It does feel really nice. Makes me feel accomplished." you said grinning down at him and Ryan love seeing you being successful. You felt his hands starting to move up your thighs "No Ryan." you scolded "But we have time. We are always super early." he begged checking his watch before placing his hand back on you so you sighed bringing your hands up to run through his hair, fixing it and at the same time admiring the length. The action caused Ryan to hum before placing his face against your stomach placing a kiss on your dress "Well, you do look really nice in the green." you said making up look up at you with soft eyes "Please." he begged again before placing more kisses along your clothed stomach, so checking your watch yourself you sighed "Fine! Just because you look very handsome right now." you chuckled and Ryan wasted no time pulling you to his lap. Just as his lips landed on yours his phone rang making him groan "Who knows we're about to have sex?" he asked annoyed before picking up his phone answering it. You watched Ryan as he talked, hands gracing over the features of his face. "Sure, no problem. I'll leave now." Ryan said before hanging up and sighing. Throwing his head back he sighed once more before looking at you "What's wrong?" you asked rubbing his shoulders "That was Tim, he wants me to drop school Jack." a smile graced your face when he said that "No no, don't smile. I've been cockblocked." Ryan said making you laugh "That's your friend, behave." you said smacking his chest before getting up and Ryan sighed at the removal of your body "I know, I know, but-" you cut him off "No buts, now, leave and drop that kid to school and then head to work. I don't want you to be late." you told him with a pointed finger and he stood up towering over you "Are you giving me orders babe?" Ryan asked looking down at you and you nodded "Yes I am, and if you don't follow said orders, we won't be able to continue what we just started tonight." you said with a raised brow and internally moaned at how you're being right now, it was turning him on but fighting it he said "Okay, I'll leave now." you chuckled "Good boy." you said with a wink before leaning up to plant a kiss on Ryan's lips and he went to deepen it but you stopped him "Not the time Ryan, it's getting away." he sighed "Okay, I'm going, I'm going." he said before giving you a quick kiss. "I'll see you at work, drive safely please." he said moving away from you and you nodded "Always." you said and you both shared a smile before he was gone.

            You were in the lab working, when you heard Eric and Calleigh entered greeting you before going to the other surface computer. Realizing who just spoke to you, you looked back catching Eric's gaze and you guys shared a knowing look and you smiled knowingly while gesturing your head to Calleigh as she was looking at her phone and Eric shook his head before chuckling "Did I miss something?" Calleigh asked looking up after hearing Eric and he appeared like a deer caught in headlights so you saved him "Just an inside joke." you told her and she bought it with a smile. Then you all turned back to your work.

            Ryan and Natalia were in the lab looking through some evidence, and discussing what they already know, but an idea came to Natalia as she put up a photo of the victim then turned to Ryan asking "What does a girl do before a big date, or in your case, what does Heather do before a big date?" Ryan thought for a moment before replying "Uh, make me wait in the living room or bedroom while she decides what shoes to wear." Ryan replied folding his arms looking towards Natalia and she chuckled "Okay, but before that, what does she do." Natalia said before pointing at the victim's photo "Because you see this right here, these little marks along her eyebrow, that's from threading." she said pointing it out to Ryan "Threading? That sounds painful." Ryan commented and Natalia explained to him what threading was and Ryan listened on, Ryan looked lowkey impressed "Wow. So you get this done in the salon?" Ryan asked curious and Natalia nodded "Monthly. I'm surprised you don't know about this." Natalia said referring to him being married "Well, I didnâ€™t because Heather doesn't do that." "Really?! So how does she get her eyebrows to look so perfect?" Natalia was truly intrigued to know and Ryan chuckled "She uh, does them herself actually. I've sat and watched her a time do it." Natalia was amazed now "No way! That's very impressive, what doesn't she do." "When I asked how she knew so well, she said she learnt before coming to Miami." "We will need to have some words." Natalia said before picking up a case file as they continued discussing the case.

            You were the first in the locker room since you had some errands to run. "There she is. The woman I was hoping to see." Came Natalia's voice as she entered the room "Hey, what's up?" you said turning to her closing your locker "I've heard that you do your own eyebrows." you were caught off guard but nodded anyway "I do, and how did this known fact come up?" you asked going over to stand next to her locker "I was explaining threading to Ryan, and that's how I found out, you don't go to a salon but do them yourself." you smiled "I do, something I learnt back home, cause I'm really weird about people touching my face." you said truthfully and Natalia understood that "So, Heather, you know what I'm going to ask you." Natalia asked with a grin and you chuckled "Yes, I would do them for you." you caught on immediately to what she was going to ask and she laughed "Thank you, because yours are perfect and I've always wanted to ask who you go to." that made you smile "Thank you." Just that moment Ryan entered the room with Eric "I thought you left already?" Ryan asked going to his locker "I am about to but had to talk with my girlfriend first." you said sending a wink towards Natalia "Just let me know when." you said referring the eyebrows and she nodded understanding "I will." With that you started to leave "Okay guys, I'm going now, I'll see you tomorrow." you said stopping by Ryan on the way out "And I'll see you at home." you said with a wink while running a hand along his arm and Ryan smirked immediately catching on "Okay. Be safe." "Always." you kissed his cheek before leaving saying your byes to everyone in the room and they all replied back.

            With everything completed, you made your way home and entered through the apartment door "I'm home baby." you said alerting your presence and Ryan wasted no time making himself present "Hey." he said coming into view and watched as you took off your shoes before resting down your bags. "Waited long for me?" you asked stepping into his hold, hands immediately going to your hips while yours wrapped around his neck "Not at all." he said signaling for you to jump and you did, wrapping your legs around his waist "Not once has this beautiful body of yours left my mind from this morning." Ryan said making you chuckle so you leaned in going to his ear whispering "Then lets fix that." you placed a kiss right below his ear making him moan "Gosh I love you." he said before connecting his lips with yours in a very heated kiss.
