            A shootout happened at a motel where Eric is temporally staying and that resulted in him calling it in. Ryan was suspicious of the whole thing, and not believing what Delko was telling him. He decided to do a little investigation on his own cause at the end of the day he actually cares for Delko and wouldn't like to see him hurt.

            Ryan came seeking you out for some help. "Hey, Heather." Ryan called out as he entered your lab and at the sound of your name made you turn around "Whoa, sounds serious. What's up?" you said giving Ryan your attention "It's Delko, I want to ask you something." you nodded "Sure, what is it?" Ryan took a deep sigh before asking his question "Did you know that he was staying at the motel?" "You mean where the shootout was this morning?" Ryan nodded answering your question so you shook your head no "No, he didn't tell me anything. Why, is something wrong?" there was a look of concern on Ryan's face "I know he's hiding something, cause I've seen it before but with myself." you smiled knowing that Ryan cares "Maybe it's something he's not ready to share yet." you told Ryan truthfully but he shook his head "I think it's something more than that. I found a field explosive kit in his room, I think he's in danger." you understood what Ryan was saying but him getting involve could put him in danger as well. "Well, if you think it's really something, don't go playing hero. Talk to Horatio about it." you said with a stern look before pointing a finger "And I mean it Ryan, go to him, do it now." Ryan nodded, taking your orders "I will. Thanks babe." you both shared a smile before he left.

            You were working on the tire threads that Ryan and Natalia got from a crime scene to see if you could identify the vehicle that was used when you heard Horatio enter the lab "Mrs. Wolfe, have we identify the vehicle yet?" he asked coming close to you and you shook your head "I've ran all the thread measurements and no ATVs match the specs." you told him "But we have the middle thread." H said looking towards you so you started to run the tire thread of the third wheel "Yeah, that's from the front wheel, so I figured the killer must have backed out and then rode away." you told H your theory "What if he didn't?" H asked thinking something else "You mean, what if the single tire was the back tire?" you said switching the tires on the screen "Yeah." H confirmed so you applied the new arrangement hoping to be lucky this time "Well that changes everything." you said finding the ATV you guys were looking for "Wow, that's amazing. The CAN-AM Spyder is a cross between a motorcycle and a ATV. Well let's see who owns one." you said starting your search "Fifty-six registered in Southern Florida." "Cross check them for women please." H suggested "Because of the lipstick on our victim, right." you did just that "Three." you said as they appeared on screen, one of the women H recognized from the bar where he visited earlier. "Well that puts her at both scenes." you said "It does, thank you." he said before leaving and you offered a smile.

            You and Ryan were home now and currently lounging on the sofa watching tv. "Did you manage to find out what it was, that Eric was hiding?" you asked Ryan turning to him and he nodded "Yeah, and it's honestly messed up, what about you?" Ryan asked at the end turning to you "Eric talked to me and I wish there was something I could do to help." you said truthfully and Ryan smiled at that "You really care for him, don't you?" Ryan asked bringing you into his side and you nodded "I really do, but I don't think it's near as much as you do." you chuckled looking up at him "You love him." you said and Ryan gave you a look making you laugh "Now, you're saying too much." and you shook your head "It's okay baby. The love is there, I know that so you don't have to say it because your actions speaks louder." you told him truthfully before kissing his cheek and turning back to the tv. Ryan loved that you understood him even if he doesn't speak his mind fully, so he kissed your temple before turning back to watching tv as well.
