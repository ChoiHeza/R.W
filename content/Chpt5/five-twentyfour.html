            "What colour dress are you wearing today?" Ryan asked you as he was going through his ties because he loves matching with you "This one." you said pulling out your royal blue dress from the closet and Ryan's face fell "But I don't have a tie to match that." he said looking back through his drawer to make sure "I know, that's why I got you this." you said pulling out a box from your closet before giving it to Ryan. He took it from you and unboxed it, and inside was a gorgeous royal blue tie, to match your dress and a smile immediately appeared on Ryan's face. "You planned this, didn't you?" Ryan asked looking up at you and shrugged "Not really. When I bought the dress I remembered you didn't have a tie in the colour so I bought it the same time." Ryan's heart softened at that "Thank you." he said before pulling you in for a kiss "No need." you told him while touching the back of his head before starting to walk away "Where are you going, I have to thank you properly." Ryan not giving you a chance to reply, he rest down the box and pulled you against him, connecting your lips. "You're lucky it's still early." you told him before jumping up and he caught you wrapping your legs around his waist, before connecting back your lips.

            Bodies were found dissolving in barrels so when brought back to the lab and Ryan went to help Tara. Entering the room, Tara had her back turned to him but he managed to catch her in the act of popping pills so he approached her about it and talked to her, but of course once again she denied it and pushed it aside putting everyone to work. Ryan allowed it for now just to work on the case, but he's going to follow up because she couldn't keep doing this.

            "Hey babe." came Ryan's voice as he entered your lab "Hey, how may I be of service my love." you greeted Ryan with a smile "Hopefully to help me clear my conscious." he said giving you a sad smile so you turned giving him your attention "What's wrong?" he sighed before replying "I caught Tara in the act this time." "Taking the pills?" you asked just to be sure and Ryan nodded so you sighed "Wow, okay, um, did you talk to H about it?" "Not yet, but I think she's stealing from the bodies." your eyes widened at that "That's a pretty big accusation Ryan, you know you got to back that up right." Ryan nodded "I know, when I talk to H about it we'll get the proof we need. But I needed to know that I'm doing the right thing and not throwing someone under the bus." he asked giving you a worried look so you touched his hand "You are, because you warned her, and keeping a secret like this can get you in trouble because what she's doing, if true, is illegal." you told Ryan truthfully hoping to rest his heart "Okay, thank you Heather." Ryan said smiling down at you and you offered one back "Anytime love."

            Ryan then went to H and confronted him about it and he told Ryan the same thing you told him, they need the proof first to make it concrete. Getting a warrant for her locker they searched it and found a bunch of pills, so H told him to do a follow up. So he went to the morgue and checked the toe tags to correspond the names with those on the pill bottles and hated that he was correct. She was in fact stealing from the bodies. While Ryan was cross referencing the pills, Julia entered the morgue with a gun and rang out a shot capturing everyone's attention, so dropping what he was doing, he went into stealth mode, but H quickly came and helped with the situation and Ryan arrested her under H's orders.

            After that was dealt with, Ryan went back to H and confirmed what he found pertaining to Tara, so H told him that he knows what to do. Ryan went to Settler about it and Settler told him to bring Tara. Tara knew what was about to come but she couldn't believe it when it happened "Ryan." she said looking towards him and he gave her a sad look "I gave you a chance, I'm sorry." Ryan told her but she was still in disbelief. So while Tara was being brought out the room in cuffs, you and Eric were walking down the hallway and caught sight of what was going on "What's going on?" Eric asked and you quickly explained what happened. Just as you both were watching her enter the elevator surrounded by officers she looked at the two of you and you weren't able to read her expressions but you truly felt sorry for her, cause it's not easy seeing a woman of colour being taken down. As Ryan came to stand beside you guys, he saw you both shared a knowing look before looking at him. You all watched till the elevator was close. "I got to get back to work." Eric said then you both shared one more look before he left you and Ryan "It hurts but you did the right thing babe." you reassured Ryan as you both walked off heading back to your lab "Doesn't feel right." Ryan commented "I know but it had to be done." you told him truthfully rubbing his back and offering a smile.

            You were both home now and Ryan was washing the dishes while you were sitting on the island counter working on your laptop. You were playing music softly from your laptop just to fill the quietness of the apartment but Ryan was the first to speak "I want to ask you something." Ryan said making you turn down the music before looking at him "Sure." he paused washing the dishes and turned to you "I saw you and Eric shared a knowing look, what was that about?" Ryan asked truly curious cause the question has been pondering on his mind from that moment "Oh, it's just that it sucks to see a person of colour, especially a woman of colour being taken down." you told him and Ryan instantly felt bad because it's his doing that that happened and you saw his expression and knew what he was thinking so you quickly reassured him "Not your fault babe, you were doing your job and she was in the wrong, so we don't hold any hard feelings towards you. It's just sad to see, that's all." you told him truthfully and you saw his features relaxed a bit "I'm sorry." you shook your head "You have nothing to be sorry about." you said getting up, making your way over to him "I promise." you said as you were in front him now and took his face in your hands and you sensed he was about to apologize again so you smiled up at him and shushed him "No, not a word." you said before quickly pecking his lips and Ryan smiled nodding "Yes mam." he said before kissing your forehead "Good." you said tapping his chest before going back to the island and he turned back to the dishes "You weren't the slightest bit mad right?" Ryan asked just wanting to be sure and you chuckled "At what?" "At what I did, with the Tara situation?" you shook your head "No, there was no reason for me to be mad." you told him "Okay, just wanted to be sure." you chuckled "It's okay babe, but if it did bother me, I would of told you, don't worry." you said smiling towards him "Thank you." he returned the smile before turning back to the sink and you turned back up the music to fill in the silence as you both went back to your previous tasks.
