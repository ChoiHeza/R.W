            "Dave, is that you sitting down?" you asked entering the lab and he turned back towards you chuckling "Yes it is, just because I'm so tall the computer surface felt too low for me so I wanted to be closer." you were next to him now "I was going to make a joke about you being old." you said chuckling "Do you want a chair as well?" he asked looking at you and you shook your head "I'm a pretty short person as you can see, but I prefer standing since I'm moving around so much." Dave nodded "Well, if you ever change your mind, I could get one for you." "Aren't you sweet. Thank you." you smiled towards him which he returned "The sweetest." Just as you were about to ask him what he's working on Calleigh and Ryan entered the lab, so you all greeted each other "Heather, I need your help on something." Ryan said coming next to you so you nodded "Sure." and at the same time Calleigh went to Dave and she asked him for help as well. So you took your tablet before following Ryan out "Do you actually need me or do you still not like me talking to Dave?" you said and Ryan chuckled "I actually need you." "Okay CSI Wolfe." you said as you both walked to where Ryan wanted your help.

            Once again later that day, Ryan needed you to check out some info with him. As you were retrieving info from a previous case you turned to Ryan "What is really going on Ryan?" "What do you mean?" Ryan asked looking at you, then you gestured towards the computer "You can easily do this yourself so something is up." Ryan was hoping you wouldn't catch on but you're pretty smart after all so he sighed before answering "I guess I'm just trying to keep you near me as much as possible." he said truthfully and you've realized it from when you were taken but that made you smile "Well Ryan, no one can snatch me from the station." "I know but still, I like being near you." Ryan said making you chuckle "Let's just get back to work and I'll deal with you later." you told him turning back to the screen and Ryan did the same. "Wait a minute, she looks just like one of the suspects from today, Bonnie." you said pointing to the lady on the screen "The surgeons wife?" Ryan nodded then it clicked "I think we found the reason why he stopped operating on her, because he created what he wanted already." Ryan said leaving you completely confused then he pulled out his phone to call Calleigh "What?" but all Ryan did was kissed your forehead "Thanks babe." he said before leaving, not even explaining himself so you just chuckled before turning back to the screen.

            You both were currently on the sofa watching a movie, your feet in Ryan's lap as he massaged your calves and feet. "Did you know that Dave works sitting down now?" you said making Ryan look towards you with a raised brow "Is it because he's secretly an old man?" Ryan asked making you chuckle "I was going to make a joke about, but he said it's because he's so tall." Ryan hated your reply, so he rolled his eyes before turning back to the tv "Of course he is." that made you laugh "Ryan, what is up with you and the guy's height, I thought you were past that?" you asked him but he remained looking at the tv "I am, it's just, he could of shared some of it with me." you just shook your head at his reply before moving closer to Ryan "Well I sure hope he doesn't, because I love your height and if you get any taller you'll be too high up for me to kiss." you said with a pout and that made Ryan smile "Really?" he asked finally looking towards you and you nodded "Yeah, I can easily just tiptoe to kiss your lips and that's perfect to me." you said before placing a kiss to his cheek, so Ryan took hold your foot pulling you closer to him to sit on his lap "Perfect?" Ryan asked as his hands went to rest on your hips and you nodded "Your body is just perfect for me." and Ryan smirked pulling you closer "All of it?" he asked hoping you caught on and that you chuckle "Is this you being a pervert?" you asked with a raised brow and Ryan shrugged "Maybe." so you decided to play with him "Well…" you started at the same time running your hands up his chest bringing them to connect behind his neck and you just shrugged so Ryan gave you a puzzled look "You don't know?" Ryan asked and you tried your best to keep yourself some smiling "Come on babe, this is mean." you chuckled caving and decided he doesn't deserve you being mean "Yes baby, all of it." you said smirking indulging him "Good, cause then I'll have to prove you otherwise." you raised a brow at that "Really now?" you asked and Ryan nodded "Sucks I decided to agree with you." you said with a sigh and Ryan laughed at that "You know I could always still show you." Ryan said but you wanted to be a tease "Nah, the moment has passed." you said removing yourself from Ryan's lap, going to sit back on your side of the sofa and Ryan looked at you in disbelief and shook his head "No no. You aren't winning this one." he said pulling you back making you lay down as he went to hover over you "What are you talking about?" you asked looking up at him innocently "I know when you're being a tease babe." so you shrugged "I have no idea what you're talking about." Ryan chuckled at that "Right… and I'm not going to make you forget your name soon from now." Ryan said smirking down at you and before you had a chance to say anything, Ryan had his lips on yours.
