            It was your off day so you decided to take the opportunity and cleaned the apartment, get some grocery shopping done and even made dinner in time for when Ryan comes home. "Hey babe." you heard Ryan's voice as he entered the apartment "Kitchen!" you called out while cleaning the sink and it wasn't long before you husband entered the kitchen with a somewhat tired look but his eye lit up the moment he saw you. "Hey." you said turning around drying your hands and Ryan wasted no time closing the distance between you two, engulfing you in a hug, head going immediately into your neck "Had a long day?" you asked rubbing his back while you him nod in the crook of your neck "Well, let's get you fed and you can rest." you said making Ryan chuckling as he pulled away "You're making me sound like a baby." you looked up at him with doe eyes "Well, you are my baby, aren't you." Ryan thought for a moment before replying "In a way, I guess I am." you chuckled and he leaned down to press a kiss to your lips "I missed you today." he said hugging you back once again "I missed you too." you said reaching up to run your fingers through the hair at the back of his head "Let me just finish with the sink then we can eat together." you said pointing over your shoulder towards the sink "Okay." Ryan said with a kiss to your forehead before going to sit on the bar stool to watch you "What was the case today?" you asked him going back to cleaning and before Ryan replied he caught sight of your wedding rings on the island "Baby kidnapped from mom in broad daylight to be sold off to another couple." Ryan said as he played with your rings "What?!" you said looking towards Ryan and he got into explaining the case, breaking it down. As he was explaining the case, you finished cleaning and asked Ryan to get the plates for you. "They sound foreign to me." you said as you and Ryan headed to the island to eat. "The couple?" Ryan asked and you nodded "I think they were." he replied before you said grace and just as you were about to eat, Ryan stopped you "Wait a minute." he said taking back up your wedding rings and held out his hand for you to place in his "Hand mam." Ryan said making you chuckled as you gave him your left hand and before putting on the rings, the tattoo on your finger caught his attention making his smile grow wider "You know because you're always wearing your rings I forget you have this." he said gracing his finger over your tattoo with his thumb "A drunken incident." you said looking at it chuckling "But it was what your heart felt in that moment, and to make it even more meaningful, you got it while we were separated, with a part of you not knowing if I'll come back or not." Ryan said looking up at you with sad eyes so you brought your other hand up to grace his cheek "There was never a part in me that doubted you Ryan. I knew you were coming back to me because you truly love me." you said offering a smile "So cheer up. This claims that I'm basically yours, even when we weren't together." you said showing him the tattoo and Ryan's smile widen "Well, I love it and the thought behind it, thank you." he said bringing your hand up to kiss the tattoo and you sent him a wink "This gesture alone makes me love you even more." he said referring to you getting the tattoo making you grin "I'm thankful that you do, because a part of me thought you hated it." Ryan looked at you in disbelief "How would that be even possible? Babe, you have my initials tattooed on your marriage finger, if anything it drives me crazy also wanting to live up to earning that spot on your finger." Ryan said truthfully but you tilted your head to side asking "You sure?" and Ryan nodded "Very sure beautiful." he said kissing the tattoo once more before putting on your rings "I never get tired of that feeling." you chuckled referring to Ryan sliding on the rings "Neither me. If I could I would marry you over and over." Ryan said smiling down at you before you both shared a kiss "So tell me about your day" Ryan said as he pulled away turning to his food and you did the same but also telling him of your day and Ryan listened intently to every word you said.
