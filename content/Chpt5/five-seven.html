            Early that morning Eric and Ryan were scheming on pranking the new M.E. Tara by replacing the body with a fake one and caused it rise up like it came to life. The boys found it funny while Tara didn't because they messed with the position of the body before she had time to work with it but if it was any other day she would of appreciated it but just not this case.

            You were just passing by the hallway when the elevator opened and Tara stepped out, so halting, you stopped to greet her "If it isn't Tara Price, what brings you up here?" you asked as she saw you, you guys have gotten a chance to get close and got along well with each other, so sighing she replied "To retrieve some crime scene photos, because your husband and his partner in crime decided to play a prank on me." she said clearly annoyed "Oh no, what did they do?" you asked concerned "They moved the victim's body before I had chance to work with it in finding out the murder weapon. And placed a dummy on my table instead that came to life jumping me." you had to smile at that cause it was clever "It's something they do to newbies. In the beginning for me, they got me with a scary video that they said was 'evidence footage'." you said making air quotes "I get that, and I'm okay with pranks but not this one cause it set me back." so you offered her a smile "I understand, I'll talk to Ryan, don't worry about it." she gave you a grateful look "Thank you." she offered a smile "I did warn you about him." you said with a pointed finger and she chuckled lightening up "You did, but not about Eric." you laughed "I can only claim one of them, so when you see Ryan, send him my way." she grinned "You got it." she said and with that you both headed in different directions.

            Ryan and Eric were in the lab when Tara entered and started removing the photos, explaining to them on how they messed up and found out that the prank was a fail "And CSI Wolfe, your wife wants to see you." Tara said looking at Ryan before she left and Ryan looked towards Delko "You think she knows?" Ryan asked concerned "I doubt it. It just happened." Ryan nodded feeling good before leaving to find you. You saw Ryan as he entered the lab "If it isn't the prankster Ryan Wolfe." you said as he made his way over to you "You knew?" Ryan asked as he stood next to you "I do. I just met Tara when she came up to our floor and she told me everything." you said giving Ryan a look and he sighed "Am I in trouble?" he asked but you looked around quick before presenting a fist to him and he looked confused "Just between us, it sounded like a good prank." Ryan smiled before bumping your fist "So I'm not in trouble then?" he asked hopeful "Oh, you are in trouble. Tara is pissed." you said making Ryan's face fall "That wasn't the plan." Ryan said truthfully "I know it wasn't but it failed. Have you apologized to her?" you asked and Ryan shook his head no "Ryan Wolfe, you can't be serious." you said disappointed "I never got time." that was true, he didnâ€™t had time "What should I do?" Ryan asked hoping you would help him out so you thought for a moment before replying "Buy her flowers." Ryan gave you a puzzled look "What?" he asked completed taken off guard by your answer "Take a page from your book for when I'm mad at you and buy her flowers." he raised a brow "Yeah, but I do that because I'm your wife." Ryan stated "I get that, but she's really pissed off at you guys, so buy her flowers and apologize. My orders." you said with a pointed finger at him "You sure?" he asked uncertain and you nodded "Yes! Women love flowers and I guarantee you that she'll forgive you." "Okay, I'll do that." he said so you smiled up at him "Good." Ryan retuned the smile "Thank you." he said with a wink so you rolled your eyes "What about you do without me?" "Make stupid decisions." he said tapping your back before leaving making you chuckle 'He's not wrong' you thought to yourself before turning back to your work.

            You and Calleigh were currently in front the surface computer looking at some photos she brought in "Is that as good as it gets?" she asked you looking at the photos "Photos are not a high enough resolution. This is as big as I can blow them up." you stated "So we can't I.D the photographer?" Calleigh asked looking for another angle "I have an idea for something different." you said with a wide smile "I like that smile, impress me." Calleigh said matching yours and you got to work telling her of the process along the way, but while working on that Calleigh asked you a question "Did you hear about the prank the guys played on Tara?" you nodded chuckling "I did, from the source herself." "Really?" you nodded "The guys wanted me to go and talk to her, to try and making up for their mistakes." the moment she said that you laughed "Such grown men they are. Ryan came to me for help on how to apologies." Calleigh looked at you chuckling "What did you tell him?" "To buy her flowers and apologies." "That is a good idea." you were about to say something the parts of the different photos pieced together making you both look at the outcome "Oh my goodness Heather, you're a genius." Calleigh grinned pulling out her phone "You are very welcome." she gave your forearm a squeeze before leaving on her call.

            "Find the murder weapon yet?" Eric asked as he entered the lab that Calleigh was in "Did you apologize to Dr. Price yet." she said looking up at him and he released a sigh "I will. At least she was able to get all the information she needed from the body." Ryan stated looking at Calleigh "Well that doesn't mean that you're off the hook. I happen to know that Ryan sent flowers." Calleigh told Eric with a smile, hoping he catches on but he chuckled "Of course he did." he said with a shake of his head "Heather told him how to apologize and I agree with her on it. Girls love flowers." Calleigh said smiling before looking away but Eric kept his gaze on her wondering if it held a double meaning.

            You guys were in the car on your way home as Ryan drove. Hand in yours on your lap, his jacket discarded to the back seat, looking very handsome in just his button up and tie "How did it go with Tara?" you asked looking towards Ryan and a smile immediately graced his lips "You were a genius, it worked." you chuckled "That's was all you babe. You do that already." and Ryan laughed "Yeah yeah, but still, thank you." he said squeezing your hand "You're welcome." you brought his head up and left a kiss at the back of it. "Did I mentioned that you looked really beautiful today?" Ryan said taking a quick glance at you before turning back to the road "You did, this morning, before the dress hit my body." you said and Ryan smirked at the memory "Well, I am a big fan of your natural beauty." he said releasing his hand from yours going to squeeze your thigh "Is this you flirting me with Mr. Wolfe?" you asked with a raised brow looking towards him "Babe, you know I flirt with you every chance that I get." Ryan chuckled raising his hand higher on your leg by a little "Or are you trying to start something while you're driving?" "Maybe that too." he said hand going higher again "Ryan you're driving." you gave him a stern look, placing your hand on his to stop his movements but he wasn't having it "Exactly, I'm driving, you're not. You don't need to have a clear mind." he said stopping at a red light before looking at you taking his hand even higher and you just shook your head "This is dangerous Ryan." you scolded "For who? Me or you?" he asked tauntingly and you just chuckled "Okay, you win." you said right before his hand reached its goal and the light turned green.
