            You received the video footage from the limo and was just uploading it to the surface computer when Natalia entered "Are you a fan as well?" she asked coming to stand next to you so you looked at her and shook your head "No sorry, I'm more of an ESPN kind of girl, but I take it that you're one" you told her and she chuckled "That's funny because Eric said the same thing, but yeah, I'm a huge fan I never miss an episode." she said looking towards you with a wide grin "Damn." you said and at that moment Ryan entered "Perfect, you guys haven't started without me." Ryan said coming to your other side "We were talking, that's why." you told him and Natalia nodded "Yeah, I found out Heather is a sports fan." Natalia said making Ryan chuckle "Just don't ever get her started, especially when a basketball game is on, she turns into their coach." Ryan said making Natalia laugh "Babe, I'm not that bad." you said looking towards Ryan and he smiled widely "That's because you can't see yourself and that's why I stopped going to sporting events with you and Delko because you two make each behave worse." Ryan said and you just covered your face "I swear to you Natalia, I'm not that bad." you said looking towards her and Ryan did the same imitating you "I swear to you Natalia, she is that bad." Ryan said making Natalia laugh at you both and just as you were about to protest a knock came at the door "Heather, are you busy?" it was Eric so you looked towards the others before looking at him shaking your head "I'm not." "Perfect, then I need you." you nodded starting to make your way towards Eric but Ryan halted you "Wait, you're just leaving us?" Ryan asked and you nodded "Yes, because I'm being bullied by my husband." you said looking back quickly towards him "What's going on?" Eric asked now curious "When I asked Heather if she's a fan of the show, funny enough she gave the same reply as you and Ryan said you both behave badly towards sports." Natalia said Eric chuckled "We do not." Eric's reply made Ryan gave Natalia a look and she understood "Weâ€™re leaving." you said pulling Eric out the lab with you making both Ryan and Natalia laugh.

            Tara sent up some evidence to Valera to process so Ryan made his way there to get those results "Hey, so I heard Tara sent up some evidence from the victim." Ryan said entering the lab and Valera looked up at him "Oh yeah. From uh, Grace Carlson. I'm still working on the nail scrapings but the sex kit DNA is running through the system as we speak." Valera said turning back to the computer "You know what's funny, you're like the first person I've met that haven't heard of her." Ryan said giving Valera a smile "Heather is a fan as well?" she asked looking towards him so Ryan shook his head "No, she's not, she doesn't know either but meant outside of her." Ryan told her "Oh, yeah sorry. I'm not really into tv. It can't beat the smell of old books." Ryan's eyes widened at that "Really?!" Ryan asked amazed and Valera nodded "That's interesting because Heather is the exact same way." now it was Valera's turn to widen her eyes and ask "Really?!" Ryan chuckled nodding "Most times when I'm watching tv, she'll be reading." Valera loved the sound of that "Heather and I need to talk books, I love it." and Ryan just shook his head, then the computer pinged letting them know the results are ready. "Is that the guy?" Valera asked and Ryan shook his head "No, but thanks Valera." Ryan said starting to leave but then turned back "Oh, uh, by the way, old books are printed with lead based ink, which makes them toxic, and they say television is hazardous to your health." Ryan said giving her a look before leaving and he left Valera there stunned.

            Ryan and Natalia were back in the lab looking for anything else that could help prolong the case. You were on the computer behind them working on something different. Natalia talked about how they reached a dead end "So you're gonna need other proof." Ryan suggested before turning back to the computer. He was going through the footage from the room that the contestants stayed in "Oh, there's night footage. Hopefully there's a cat fight between the girls and their wearing bikinis." Ryan commented making Natalia laugh "Heather did you hear him?" Natalia asked loudly for you to hear so you chuckled "I did." at that same moment you took up your tablet making your way for the exit "Where are you going?" Ryan asked looking at you "To pass off some info to Dave." you said with a wink before leaving and Ryan shook his head "That's very funny wife." Ryan said after you and you wave your hand not turning back to him "I'm just playing your game husband." you said before you were completely gone "I deserved that one." Ryan mumbled to himself while turning back to the computer and Natalia chuckled "Woman can hold her own, I love it." Natalia commented before she and Ryan went back to the footage.

            "So am I forgiven?" Ryan asked as you both were taking an evening stroll after eating from your favourite food spot  "For what?" you asked looking up at him "When I made the comment about the girls in bikinis?" you chuckled and shook your head "I was never mad." so Ryan gave you a look "Really?" and you nodded "Really. You were just being a guy." you told him truthfully "Like me just being a woman when I'm out with the girls and we check out guys." now that caught Ryan's attention "You what?!" Ryan paused making you both halt walking so you turned towards him taking his hands in your "I'll give an example, the last time we hung out, Calleigh pointed at a guy and asked us what we thought about him." you said with a shrug "And what did you say?" Ryan asked with a raised brow curious "He was an okay looking guy." you said truthfully and Ryan made a face "That's a good reply." Ryan said making you laugh "But it's hard to find someone that's as handsome as you. Truthfully your face has become my type so it's hard to be attracted to anyone else." you spoke honestly "So that means you find all other men ugly now?" Ryan asked trying to understand so you shook your head "No, I can still tell if a guy is good looking I just meant it wouldn't do anything to me, still an Ace remember." you told him and he understood smiling "Well that is very comforting." Ryan said capturing your face and giving you a kiss "Well, you don't have to worry about me either." Ryan told you making you chuckle "I never was." you said smiling up at him before giving him a kiss of your own. You guys shared a smile before intertwining back your fingers and continuing your stroll.
