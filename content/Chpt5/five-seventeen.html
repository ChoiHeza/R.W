            Today was going to be a good day for you because you were getting another colleague to work with you, which is going to be a big help. You had to leave earlier that morning for work to help him get adjusted and set up, along with teaching him how to operate the surface computer, his name was Dave and he was nothing like Cooper, smart but not a smart ass and he was a gentlemen the whole time. You guys bonded pretty quickly because of your job description and you guys share a lot of the similar interest so it felt nice to have someone you can smart talk with and they understand.
        </p><br>
        <p class="story">
            Ryan sent you guys some photos from the crime scene to go through so you decided to use this as a teaching opportunity for Dave, so he could get accustom with the equipment. Dave asked about the last computer guy, Cooper and you told him about him. Then you remember the joke that Cooper placed on the site that the guys didn't get so you told him about it and Dave immediately got it and laughed "He sounds like a jerk but that was a pretty good joke." Dave said and you nodded, laughing along and at that same time Ryan entered the lab catching you two laughing with each other and something in Ryan didn't settle right seeing the interaction "What's so funny?" he said slowly coming towards you two "I told Dave about a joke." you said then introduced Ryan and Dave to each other "So you got the photos?" Ryan asked so you turned to Dave "We did, but I think I'm going to let Dave take over this one." so Dave gave you a nervous look "You sure?" you nodded "You gotta start somewhere, but I'll still be here." you said going to the other side of Dave so Ryan could stand next to him. Then you gestured your hand for him to begin so he sighed before starting "I was able to stitch together a virtual view of the photos from before and after the hanging." Dave said confidently making you smile as you both looked on and Ryan didn't miss the smile you produce so he looked at Dave then back to the screen "God Dave, what is taking you so long, is the learning curve too steep for you. It's not even complex, I learnt the whole thing in like one day." Ryan commented cause he clearly felt intimidated by Dave so you leaned forward and looked towards Ryan to say something but Dave stopped you "Nice, picking on the new guy. Well Heather here is an amazing teacher and I've managed to learn a good set of the program but unlike you my friend I have to learn the behind the scenes stuff as well." Dave said as a comeback towards Ryan, you both weren't expecting that reply because you know how Ryan can be toward newbies but lowkey you were impressed so you tried to stifle your laughter while Ryan looked shocked and you just thought to yourself 'You know what, Dave's got this.' so you looked between the two "Dave, I mostly stayed because Ryan can be hard on the newbies but you showed me you could handle him." you said with a smile towards him then you turned to Ryan with a pointed finger "I told you the day was coming." you said before taking up your tablet then reached up to tap Dave's arm "Since I've seen that you're way more than capable, I have some info to go and deliver." you said gesturing to the tablet as you started to leave them both before stopping by Ryan "Close your mouth babe, you'll catch flies." you said with a tap to his cheek before walking out. Then Ryan and Dave turned to each other "She warned you about me didn't she?" Ryan questioned and Dave nodded before turning back to the screen "She did but she didn't believe me when I said I could handle it, but I guess she believes now." Dave said with a smile. Lowkey deep down, the emotion that Ryan was feeling was jealousy. He didn't like that you guys bonded so quickly and were making jokes, or the fact that he held the same level of smartness that you did. It also didn’t help that he was way taller than Ryan, handsome and has long hair. So yeah, Ryan was feeling jealous and the fact that you guys would be working together going forward, he didn’t like it. Ignoring his emotions for now, they went back to discussing what was on the screen.

            You guys managed to get through your day smoothly but there is still more that you have to teach Dave but he is definitely getting the hang of it pretty quickly. "You have to show me your source code for the program, or is that a company secret?" Dave asked you as you both were in the locker room at the end of your shift "Well, it's my personal code so I don't mind showing you, cause you never know, they might be ways you can make it better." Dave laughed at that "I highly doubt that, you're way too smart." so you shook your head "I think we're the same level because the background stuff you picked up pretty quickly." you commented then he mentioned something that he picked up on while learning it "I saw the joke you hidden in there." he said starting to laugh and you couldn't believe it "No way you did." you said in disbelief but he told you what it was making you both laugh out "You're the first person to get that." you said and he shook his head "How? But then again it was so cleverly placed." he commented. Little did you guys know that Ryan was outside the door watching you both engage with each other and he didn't like the feeling that it gave him "Are you spying Wolfe?" Delko asked coming beside Ryan and he shook his head, quickly looking towards Delko before looking back at you two "I'm not, I just don't like seeing them together." Ryan commented truthfully "Is this jealousy I'm sensing from you?" Delko teased but that irritated Ryan a bit "I'm not, I just, look at them, laughing together like that. He understands her when she talks smartly and I can see that impresses her because I don't get that look because I don't get those jokes." Ryan said clearly jealous so Delko decided to help "Well Ryan, I don’t think you have anything to worry about. This is Heather we're talking about, still loves you but she's probably just happy to have someone around to talk her language with and you're going to have to be okay with it because they're going to be working together going forward and you can't hate the guy forever." Delko said truthfully and Ryan knew he was right but jealousy was just clouding his vision at the moment "And look at how tall he is." Ryan randomly stated making Delko chuckle "Okay Wolfe, let's go in." he said pushing Ryan into the room in protest and that caught you and Dave's attention. So you all greeted each other. "Eric, it looks like Ryan has met his match." you said gesturing to Dave and Eric chuckled at that "He picked on you didn't he?" Eric asked Dave and he nodded smiling "He did, but I managed to handle myself because Heather warned me." "And how are you picking up the surface computing?" Delko asked turning towards Dave "Pretty quickly, it was very smartly designed. I was in complete awe." Dave complimented towards you and you did a curtsy "Why thank you good sir." you said towards him offering a smile, then you felt your phone vibrate, checking you saw it was Monica, you were supposed to meet her that evening before going home. "I almost forgot, I gotta meet Monica." you said looking towards Ryan and he nodded "Okay." so quickly, you turned to the others "I gotta go. See you guys tomorrow, and Dave, bright and early again." you said then pointed at Dave for the last bit and he nodded "You got it." so they all told you bye and you stopped by Ryan quickly kissing his cheek "I'll see you at home." you said with a smile but he gave you a tight lip one. "Okay, be safe." you nodded finding his reactions weird before leaving.

            "Hey babe." you said coming in through the apartment door but was met with silence. So taking off your shoes you called out again but silence. You headed for the bedroom and saw he was there in bed watching tv "Hey hun." you said and he just hummed, not even looking at you. Before if you thought Ryan was acting weird, now you were definitely sure that he was "What's wrong with you?" you asked coming over to him but he just shook his head saying "Nothing." so you raised a brow at that before going to stand in front the tv blocking off his view so he has no choice but to look at you. So turning it off, you turned back to him folding your arms "Explain yourself Ryan." Ryan sighed before sitting up "You and Dave." Ryan said but you didn't catch on "What about me and Dave?" you asked truly confused "I saw you guys today." he left you even more confused with that statement "And what exactly did you see and stop replying in short sentences and explain fully." you told him sternly and he explained all that he saw "Okay, but I still don't see what's the problem." you said dropping your arms now with a shrug so Ryan sighed before saying how he felt "I didn’t like it okay, I was jealous." then your features entered a state of realization "Oh." then you smiled before approaching him "You're jealous of Dave?" you asked and he shook his head "Don't make me say it again." "So what do you want me to do, not work with him anymore?" Ryan sighed "No because you're just doing your job, it's just when you guys laugh together and share jokes." Ryan said looking down so you sighed before sitting in front of him "Look at me." you told Ryan and he looked up "I'm going to speak honestly with you okay." you stated first and Ryan nodded afraid to hear what you will say "I like Dave, but not as the way you're thinking, I like him as a friend and coworker. From since Cooper, I've felt comfortable with him and we bond more, and no he doesn't have any ill intentions." "You don't know that, he might be secretly crushing on you." that made you chuckle "I highly doubt that. When he found out what I'm capable of, with my skills, he wants me to help him build a program for his girlfriend." you said tilting your head to the side and Ryan immediately felt stupid "I didn’t know." Ryan said so you position yourself to straddle Ryan's lap "Being jealous is okay, I get that. Just don't let it become a problem for us cause then you'll keep hating the guy and that'll interfere with my work." you said running your fingers through the hair at the back of his hand "I love you Ryan, I am married to you, my name is Heather Wolfe, because I wanted to take the love of my life last name." you said reassuring Ryan and he took hold of your waist. He knew you were right, and what Delko told him before was true as well but hearing it from you settled his heart more "Thank you." "What for?" "Settling my heart." he said before pulling you in for a hug "I'm sorry." he said while you rubbed his back "What for?" "For being jealous." you shook your head "You don't have to apologize for that because I've been there before." that made Ryan pull away to look at you "When was this?" his eyes lit up and you chuckled "Was a time back with you and Natalia. Because have you seen her, she's gorgeous and she gets your scientific talks." Ryan smiled at that because he didn't know you get jealous as well, he thought it was always him "So you get jealous as well?" he clearly heard nothing you said and just focused on the fact that you get jealous so you chuckled "That's all you're hearing right now?" you asked and Ryan rapidly nods his head making you shake yours "Wow." you said starting to move away from him but he held you in place "No no, you're not going anywhere. Another guy had your attention today so now it's my turn to have all of it." Ryan said smirking up at you bringing his hands down to rub your bum "But you always have my attention." you told him truthfully going to place kisses in his neck "Then show me." he teased so that made you look at him with a smirk "Is that a challenge Mr. Wolfe?" you asked with a raised brow and he pulled you closer towards him "One that I won't back down from." so you chuckled "He says that now." you said before capturing his lips with yours in a very heated kiss.
