            "So any plans for after work or tonight?" you asked Ryan turning to him while you were both in the locker room. "I was trying to book that restaurant that we've always wanted to go to but they're always filled up. But they did say if they get an opening they'll call me." you nodded at that "So, and if they don't call, you have a plan b?" you asked him and he turned to you closing his locker "Of course, but it will be a surprise." Ryan said smiling widely and you joined him "I like the sound of that." just as Ryan was about to say something his phone rang so he apologized with his eyes and you told him itâ€™s okay "This is Wolfe." he answered and he listened on before speaking again "What? Where are you?" concern instantly overtook his face "Okay, just calm down, I'll be there." Ryan said before hanging up "Babe I got to go, that was Mark, he's in some sort of trouble." you nodded urgently "Go, be careful." you said, no questions asked "I will." Ryan said before kissing your forehead and leaving. You watched him leave and just kept wondering what kind of trouble Mark has gotten himself into this time. So sighing, you left the locker room and headed up ready to start your shift.

            Arriving at Mark, Ryan found him in the middle of getting beaten by a guy, so taking action he took out his gun but the guy got a better hand and knocked the gun out of Ryan's hand, so Ryan and the guy were in a fist on fist fight before Horatio showed up, stopping it, and when they asked the guy who he was, he straight up offed himself without a thought. Ryan quickly rushed to him to see, if he could stop the bleeding but it was too late. Horatio asked questions and Ryan answered the best he could of based on what he knew, but by inspection of the guy's tattoos suggested that he was in the Russian mob, and instantly the situation became a red flag. So Ryan hurried back to the lab to see what he could find out.

            While in your lab working, your attention was taken away from your screen by a voice "Hey Heather." it was Eric as he entered the lab making his way to you "Hey, what do I owe the pleasure." you said smiling looking up at him and he returned it "I came to talk to you about something." he suggested and you nodded "I'm all ears." Eric sighed before continuing "Calleigh." he started and you decided to make a comment "You love her, we know this." you said making Eric chuckle "I've been thinking about making a move." your eyes widened at that "Really?!" he nodded and you couldn't contain your smile "How are you going to do it?" "I'm not sure. I was hoping you could of helped me." so you thought for a moment "You could try gifting her something, that's special or has meaning to her." Eric nodded liking the idea and then realization flashed across his eyes "Today at the main crime scene, she mentioned these chocolates that are favourites' of hers, but are really hard to acquire because they're out of state." "What kind of chocolates are these?" you asked and Eric gave you a name and instantaneously a smile graced your face "I think you are just in luck CSI Delko, because I happen to know someone that has those treats you desire." Eric's face lit up "Are you serious?" you nodded "Dead serious, and I'm going to get a box for you today." you told him with a grin and Eric's face matched yours "Heather, I don't know how to thank you. I really don't" you shrugged "It's what friends are for Eric." Eric just kept thanking you nonstop making you smile.

            "Heather Wolfe." came Calleigh's voice as she entered the lab "I'm being full named, am I in trouble." you said smiling looking towards Calleigh and she shook her head chuckling "Of course not." before she continued you halted her "Ms. Duquesne, I am in love with the look." she paused doing a little pose for you, making you both laugh "Why thank you Mrs. Wolfe." she said before approaching you "And it's so on theme." you chuckled "What are the chances." she said before handing you a chip "So what are we doing with this?" you asked taking the chip from her "This was from the victims camera." you nodded "And you want to see what we can find that will be helpful?" she smiled towards you "You know it." you both shared a smile before turning to the screen getting started.

            After getting the lab results from Mark's belongings, and not liking them, Ryan went to confront Mark about it. Ryan felt betrayed and hurt, knowing that he's been helping Mark, but he just seemed to be going back to his old ways. Mostly Ryan felt pissed knowing that Mark dragged him into something dangerous and most likely brought you along as well, because you also help out Mark and look after his son Billy. So he looked to Mark and pointed "You dragged me into this, meaning you've probably dragged my wife into this as well and knowing it's the Russian mob, they attack from all angles." Mark felt hurt cause he never meant for any of this to happen "I will deal with this." Mark said looking apologetically towards Ryan so he shook his head "No, I will deal with this, cause it's out of your control now, so if you want to help your son, help yourself." Ryan said pointedly before getting up and leaving.

            After getting tox reports back on Mark from Calleigh, Ryan found it out, cause there was no cocaine found in his system, so Calleigh figured he's covering up for something bigger. So Ryan decided to confront Mark about it and realized he was being threatened by the mob leader, as far as blackmailing him with his son. He wanted Mark to dose the horse with cocaine, but he couldn't bring himself to do it. So sensing the seriousness of the situation Ryan suggested that Mark and son leave town and disappear and start over somewhere else. But Mark said it would be futile because no matter where they go, the Russians would always find them, so Ryan and H decided to come up with a plan to capture the mob leader. And they succeeded but little did they know, it only made things worse.

            You saw Eric entered the lab cause you called him to come and see you "What's up?" he asked and you looked at him smiling widely so he caught on "You got them?" you nodded "They're in my locker, my number is 333." you told him and a wide grin appeared before he thanked you a million times before leaving, making you laugh.

            Ryan called and let you know he had to do something after work so you could on home without him. Besides this morning in the locker room, you have not seen Ryan all day, cause you were both busy with your own tasks. It was an hour before you heard Ryan entered the apartment "Hey babe." Ryan said coming in through the door but you didn't hear him because you were in the bedroom picking out an outfit for tonight. Only when you saw him enter the bedroom did you know he was home "Hey babe." Ryan said again making you look towards him and you greeted him with a smile but it quickly faltered cause you caught sight of his outfit "What happened?" you asked gesturing to it and Ryan looked down before replying "The incident with Mark from this morning, and I got my shirt dirty so I came home and changed." Ryan asked coming towards you after shedding his jacket "Anything serious?" you asked Ryan and he shook his head "Nothing major to worry about. Got it taken cared off." Ryan hated having to hide this from you because since you guys got back together he has been a completely open book with you but this situation, involving the Russian, he definitely wants to leave you out of it, because these are some very dangerous people and if something ever happened to you, he would hate himself. So the less you know, the better. "Okay. So are we still on for tonight?" you asked wrapping your arms around Ryan's neck making him smile and he captured your waist "Of course, and it will be plan b. Sadly I did not get a call back, but we will not lose hope." Ryan said making you chuckle "So how shall I dress for plan b, since it's a surprise?" you asked smiling up at Ryan "Fancy and sexy." Ryan said smirking and you shook your head "Is this just for you, or are we actually going somewhere?" you asked with a raised brow "We are actually going somewhere, don't worry." he said leaning down to peck your lips before leaving "Okay Mr. Wolfe, fancy and sexy it is." you said before turning back to closet looking for clothes that matches the description.
