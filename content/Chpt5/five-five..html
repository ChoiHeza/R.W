            You were in the lab just finishing up something when Calleigh entered "Hey Heather." you turned looking at her "Hey, just the person I wanted to see. I finished what you wanted." you said handing her the documents you printed "Perfect. I need you for something else." you nodded "Sure, what is it?" "How do you feel about coming into the field with me, and going to the main crime scene." you chuckled "I would feel pretty excited if I was a CSI, but I'm just a computer tech." she grinned "That's why I need you cause you're the best computer tech I know. At the boutique they have smart mirrors that captures and records." you finally caught "And you need the data from it before the murder?" Calleigh nodded "It's too big to bring back here." "Okay, so what are you waiting for, let's go." you said happily making Calleigh laugh as you both left arm in arm.

            Arriving to the scene it was pretty interesting to see because it was your first time in the field and you were low key excited, plus you got a glimpse more into Ryan's work life and an idea to what he sees. Calleigh showed you where the mirror was and you set up to see what footage you can get, while she went to talk to the owner to see what else she could find out. "Hey Heather, whatcha got?" she asked coming back into the dressing room with the owner behind her "The display panel's hard drive is set up to capture it's video every couple of minutes, but the explosion blew out the motherboard." you told her as you typed away "Can you pull anything?" Calleigh asked looking on "Just the last few moments." you said giving her a look before replaying it on the mirror. While the video played the owner explained to Calleigh what was happening and why it wasn't him that gave her the dress. You and Calleigh shared a look after the owner spoke realizing that this situation ran deeper.

            Calleigh went to visit Ryan to see if he had the dress fixed back together, and what he found out about what kind of bomb it was. After they discussed, Calleigh was about to leave but she remembered something she wanted to tell Ryan "Guess what, I took Heather out into the field today." Calleigh said with a wide smile and Ryan's matched hers "Oh really. She's CSI now?" "Unofficially. I had to get data from the mirror in the boutique, but she was very happy to come along and get outside the lab for once." Calleigh said grinning now remembering how you were and that made Ryan feel good inside "I'm glad she enjoyed it." Ryan said smiling imagining how you must have been.

            "Beautiful." Ryan said alerting you of his presence as he enters the lab "Do you ever check before entering to make sure I'm in here? Now what if it was Eric?" you asked with a raised brow and a smile appeared on his face "Well, Delko is not a bad looking guy, plus I always look in from outside first." you chuckled as Ryan came next to you "I'll tell him you said that." and Ryan pointed a finger at you "Don't you dare say a word." he warned and you just chuckled "So what do you need help with?" you asked and he held up a cellphone "Anything that could help us identify our bomber." you nodded "Okay, put it on." Ryan placed the phone on the surface computer and you began to pull up the contents of the device, turning to look at Ryan to ask a question, his lips caught your eye "Since when do you have chapped lips." Ryan looked at you before licking his lips "I guess it's a bit dry today, plus I'm mostly in the field today than inside the lab." so you reached into your pocket and pulled out your lip balm, offering it to him "Use it, cause I'm a big fan of your soft lips." Ryan eyed the chap stick and you "What if I refuse?" he asked with a raised brow "Then you won't be able to kiss me." you said with a shrug before turning back to the computer and Ryan chuckled taking the balm from you "Thank you babe." he applied it before putting it back in your pocket "So, where to start?" you asked pulling up the different apps from the phone "Well, teens these days have all their life on their phones, so start with photos and let's go from there." you nodded pulling up the app, allowing the photos to be displayed. As you both looked through them one caught Ryan's eye "Wait a second." he said pointing at it and you made it full screen "That's the murder victim. She's standing outside the fitting room that's the crime scene." Ryan said as you both looked closer at the photo. Someone in the background caught your eye,  so you enhanced on said person "I can enhance it some more but I'm afraid that's as good as you're gonna get." you said before part of the persons face was cut off and only their hand was in the shot "No, I got everything I need." Ryan said recognizing the watch the person was wearing, he pulled out his phone to make a call "I know who I gotta bring in. Thanks babe." he said with a wink and a tap on your lower back before leaving.

            "You know, for someone, me, that doesn't love the colour pink, loves to see it when you're wearing it." you said titling your head to the side and Ryan chuckled "I've realized, but I'm not going to complain about it." you just couldn't take your eyes off of him "I can't decide if you look cute or sexy." you said with a wink "Just from wearing pink?" you nodded "Plus your hair is getting longer, meaning there's more for me grab onto." and Ryan laughed "Be careful there babe, we're still at work." "But our shift is over." you commented back so Ryan closed his locker and turned to you "Yeah, but we're in the locker room." "Then why don't you hurry and take me home, so I can find out if I find you cute or sexy." you teased and Ryan was just about to close the distance between you two but a voice came halting him "I'm going to think twice now when trying on clothes." came Natalia's voice as she entered the locker room with Calleigh "Tell me about it." Calleigh agreed "Heading off now guys?" Natalia asked noticing you and Ryan "Yeah, had a long day, and I'm craving something sweet." you said with an innocent smile hoping Ryan catches on while the others don't "Like ice cream?" Calleigh asked not catching on "Yeah, but more like strawberry ice cream." you said indirectly referring to Ryan because he was wearing a pink shirt, and Ryan definitely caught on because he coughed, being taken by surprise of your comment "You okay babe?" you asked turning to Ryan rubbing his back "Yeah, I'm fine. Anyways guys, we have to go, so I'll see you all tomorrow." Ryan said trying to keep his blush down and keep calm and you just laughed "Tomorrow guys, bye." you told them with a wave as Ryan tugged you along and they all waved and said their byes. Outside the room walking side by side Ryan leaned in and whispered "So I'm ice cream now?" you smirked before pausing, holding him back so you can tiptoe and whisper in his ear "Yeah, and a delicious one that I can't wait to get home and devour." you said with quick light kiss to his ear lobe before walking off. 'God I love this woman.' Ryan thought before rushing back to your side.
