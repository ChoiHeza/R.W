            The day started off normal, so much smoother because having Dave working with you lessened a lot of the work load and with you two a lot more was able to be done. Since you were still working on some updates for different programs Dave was able to work with the team that morning while you managed to get other work done which was such a nice feeling, instead of having to stop constantly to do something else.

            Ryan and Natalia were on the plane, working the crime scene trying to find out what happened with the air hostess when Natalia discovered a hidden elevator that led to a little room at the top of the plane. Then Ryan and Natalia got to talking about the room they found "I can't believe they have these little love nests on planes." Ryan said looking around in disbelief before looking towards Natalia "You know, I think we need one of these." Ryan said going back to looking around "Yeah right, we could convert firearms." Natalia said joking with Ryan "Sure, I could think of two people who would enjoy that." Ryan said not having you two in mind but another couple "Oh, who?" Natalia questioned looking at Ryan and he stopped to look at her, giving her the 'think about it' look, then she chuckled "I don't think you need any more reasons to spend more time with your wife Ryan." she said laughing and Ryan shook his head "I wasn't even thinking about Heather and I but that would be a good idea though." Ryan commented "Then who were you thinking about?" Natalia asked and Ryan gave her the look again, then realization crossed her face and her eyes widened "Calleigh and Delko, no way." she said in utter disbelief, she was at a loss for words "Do you have proof?" she asked pointing a finger at Ryan and he held his hand up "I don't have any proof, I just have a feeling." then Natalia got to thinking "Did you get this from Heather?" she asked Ryan and he shook his head "Not directly because she never tells me what she and Delko talks about but I sensed something along those lines." Ryan said chuckling making Natalia make random noises "I don't wanna hear it." she said shaking her head and waving her hands making Ryan laugh, so they returned back to investigating the room.

            You were in the lab just finishing up something when Ryan entered "Hey beautiful, where's Dave?" Ryan said coming over to you "Bathroom break, need something?" you asked turning to him and he held up a camera "Need to look at some photos." "I could help with that or do you prefer your new best friend Dave?" you said with a teasing smile and Ryan faked laugh "You're funny babe, you know I prefer you any day." he said handing you the camera and you took it from him "So what's this about?" you asked plugging in the camera "It belonged to our victims stalker." Ryan said folding his arms "Ew. Lord, please don't let me see anything unpleasant." you said making Ryan chuckle "By the way, you would not believe what Natalia and I found today on the plane." "What?" you asked uploading the photos "A love nest." that made you look towards him with a suspicious look and raised brow "You guys found a love nest?" you asked and Ryan realized how it may have sound so he immediately shook his head "Not like that babe, we were just amazed by it." Ryan said trying to justify himself and you just laughed "Calm down babe, I'm just teasing you but I didn't know planes had those though." you said turning back to the screen "It's more like a rest area for the pilots and air hostess but we both know, no resting goes on up there." Ryan said making you chuckle "Facts." "I joked and said we could use one of them, the department I mean cause I may know of a couple that would enjoy that." Ryan said giving you a side look so you scolded him "Babe, we have a home already. Why would we need to do it at work as well?" you asked him with a raised brow and he shook his head "Not us I was thinking about." he said giving you a look hoping you would spill something, so you looked around before looking back to him "What are you getting at Ryan Wolfe?" you asked with a raised brow challenging him so he shrugged "I just have a feeling that Calleigh and Delko maybe somewhat of an item." Ryan said but you weren't going to be a snitch "That's interesting." you said trying to play it cool turning back the computer sorting through the photos "No comment?" Ryan asked smiling so avoided his question by pointing at the screen "The photos are ready." Ryan just chuckled and turned to the screen, he'll get what he needs to know from eventually.

            Calleigh, Delko and Ryan were in a lab discussing the case trying to find out what they were missing. "Do you have the flight data analysis?" Calleigh asked looking towards Ryan "No, Heather has that, I'll get her bring it." Ryan said pulling out his phone to call you. Seeing it was Ryan that was calling you decided to have fun with it "This is Wolfe." you answered saying Ryan's line whenever he answers the phone, that made him chuckle "Cute. I need you to bring the flight data analysis to the data lab for me please." "Sure no problem. On my way." you said before hanging up and getting the drive. "Hey." you said entering the lab and seeing Calleigh, Eric and Ryan there. "I have what you need." you said presenting the drive to Ryan and he took it from you "Thank you beautiful." Ryan said with a smile and the others thanked you as well. "Can I stay?" you asked and Calleigh chuckled "Of course." she said and you went beside her and looked on as they went back to discussing what they were talking about.

            "Did you tell Ryan something about Calleigh and I?" Eric asked and you shook your head "I didn't but today he even tried getting info out of me, cause he said he had a feeling but I didn't indulge." you said truthfully and of course Eric believed you "A feeling? Well, he is a good CSI for a reason." Eric commented "If he does figure it out though, I would let him know to keep it a secret." you told Eric and he nodded "Thanks Heather. By the way something weird happened today." Eric said as you closed your locker turning to him "What was it?" you asked giving him your full attention "I pictured Calleigh and I taking a trip together on the plane." the moment those words left his mouth, a huge grin appeared on yours "I think you guys should really do it, get away together for a little bit. I think it would be really nice." you suggested with a shrug and Eric chuckled "Wouldn't it be too soon though?" Eric questioned "Well, just a while ago you nearly lost Calleigh, and we're not in the kind of job to take things slow. Ryan proposed to me after we were dating for two years." you said making a point and Eric agreed "You are right. I'll think about it." "You should." you said offering him a smile because you're so happy to see your ship sailing.

            It was Friday so you and Ryan were currently at the ice cream parlor having your favourite "Okay babe, I'm going to be straight forward." Ryan said resting his spoon in his glass before looking fully at you "You know I'm never wrong about my feelings so that's why I'm convinced that Calleigh and Delko are together." as Ryan spoke you just smiled because you know he doesn't drop things easily "And you're sure sure about this feeling?" you asked him with a raised brow and he nodded "All the signs are there, how they act around each other and the stares." so sighing you nodded "I see." so you leaned forward and gestured your finger for Ryan to do the same "You're correct." and his eyes widened "I knew it!" he said smiling widely "How long?" he asked and you went back to eating your ice cream "Not my place to tell but you have to keep this between us, cause Eric doesn't want anyone to know and I mean it Ryan." he nodded with seriousness "I understand. I won't say a thing." so you offered him a smile "Thank you." Ryan smiled towards you cause everything made sense now "So those talks and meetings between you and Eric?" you nodded "Were sometimes about him and Calleigh." you said and Ryan chuckled "Wow, I can't believe it." "You should, because I was gonna kill Eric if he didnâ€™t make a move." you said making Ryan laugh and you guys continued talking about one thing to another till all the ice cream was gone.

            "She suggested that fire arms be made into the love nest?" you asked looking at Ryan in the mirror as you did your face mask "Yeah, and I know we were joking but that wouldn't be such a bad idea." Ryan replied and you raised a brow at him "That's a very bad idea Ryan, also so inappropriate." you said honestly and Ryan chuckled "Well I was thinking more along the lines of a rest room and not a literal love nest. Like those times I have to work a double shift and I just want to rest a little bit." Ryan said clarifying and you nodded "Now that I understand and that's actually not a bad idea, but sadly some people would abuse it." so Ryan looked at you "You think so?" he asked and you nodded before turning back to your reflection "I guess that's why we can't have nice things." Ryan said making you chuckle "You'll be fine." you told him and he moved to take hold of you from behind, resting his head on your shoulder "Are you and Dave still on good terms?" Ryan asked out of the blue "Yes we are, why?" you asked finishing with the mask then dropping your hands to meet his as you looked at him through the mirror "So then you won't have to around him so much." Ryan said making you chuckle "Are you still jealous about that?" you felt Ryan shrug "Just a little bit. He's like really tall." so you raised your brows hearing that "You're intimidated by his height?" "Not really." you just smiled at Ryan shaking your head "Well, I think your height is perfect." "You're just saying that because you're my wife." Ryan mumbled so you shook your head "Even before we were married, or dating. I loved everything about you and I will continue to love those things, till we both shrivel up and die." you said making Ryan chuckle so he kissed your shoulder "Thanks babe, I know he's not a threat but it's hard to ignore at times." Ryan said truthfully "Well, just remember who's here holding me currently." you said tightening his arms around you making Ryan smile "I love you." Ryan said after turning you in his arms so you took how of his neck before replying "And I love you." you said and that made him lean down to kiss your lips but instantly regret it "I keep telling you to not kiss me when I'm wearing the mask." you said chuckling at Ryan's face as it was in disgust "I know I know, but I never listen." he said making you laugh so you leaned up and kissed his cheek. "It's not going to kill you." "You don't know that." you chuckled "Well, the amount of times you've done it, nothing has happened yet." you told him with a pointed finger before turning back to the mirror "Yeah yeah." Ryan said before taking back hold of you from behind.
