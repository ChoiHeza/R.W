            "You know this is one of my favourite looks on you." you told Ryan approaching him "The white shirt with jeans?" you nodded smiling at Ryan "You look really nice in white." you said bringing your hands up to run along his clothed chest "It's sucks that it's your day off, or we could of worn white together, cause it is one of my favourite colours on you as well." Ryan capturing your waist so you tilted your head to the side "Yeah, it does suck." you said leaning up and pecking Ryan's lips before moving out his arms so he could finish get ready for work. You went back to bed and watched Ryan as he got ready and when he was finished he approached you "I have to go baby." he said as you went to the edge of the bed on your knees "Okay, have a good day, and please be careful. I want you coming home to me alive and in one piece." you told Ryan sternly and he nodded giving you a smile "I promise." he said looking down at you lovingly "Thank you. Let me walk you out." you said getting off the bed and followed Ryan to the main door. "I love you." you said pulling him in tightly into your embrace and he returned it "And I love you, relax today okay?" Ryan said pulling away before capturing your face in his hands so you nodded "I will." "That's my girl." he said smiling down at you before capturing your lips for a goodbye kiss.

            Calleigh and Ryan got called out to a house because a bad smell was reported, so upon investigation, they found a body in the attic. While up there, they heard a noise "Maybe it's backup?" Ryan suggested but Calleigh shook her head "They would have announced themselves." just after Calleigh said that gun shots came through the flooring towards them, so immediately they took out their guns and started shooting back, causing the person to stop. Just when they wondered if they got the person, they heard beeping before hearing and feeling an explosion instantaneously engulfing the house in flames. And the fact that smoke rises, the attic started to fill up pretty quickly, so Ryan tried breaking open a wooden window why Calleigh tried for the floor. The same time while escaping, they managed to get the body out, securing any evidence they could. Emergency and rescue came to the scene to get the fire under control and Horatio also showed up. He told them to leave with the ambulance to the hospital to get checked up to get the all clear before returning back to work. While at the hospital, Ryan realized that he'll need to get home and change his clothes but he doesn't have his car and he doesn't want to take a cab looking like this, so he decided to give you a call. Right before he could call, Delko showed up because he heard what happened and came to check up on you guys "Do you need a ride?" Delko asked him and Ryan shook his head "I'm going to call Heather so I'll just see you back at the lab." Delko nodded before leaving with Calleigh.

            You were reading when you your phone rang, seeing it was Ryan, you quickly answered "Hey babe, miss me that much?" you joked into the phone and Ryan chuckled "Of course, but that's not why I'm calling. I need a favour." you heard Ryan sighed "Sure, what is it?" there was hesitancy before Ryan replied "Can you come and pick me up from the hospital please." Immediately your mind started racing and Ryan sensed it so he quickly put a stop to it "I'm fine. I'll explain when I see you." so you wasted no time in leaving home, not caring that you were wearing a pair of sweats and one of Ryan's t-shirts.
        </p><br>
        <p class="story">
            Upon arrival you asked for Ryan, and they told you wear to go. So entering the room you looked around but his voice helped you find him "Heather!" he called out and you immediately whipped around towards his direction and sprinted towards him. Taking in the sight of him, your heart dropped so the moment you were in front of him he stood up and you pulled him into your arms. Ryan felt you squeezing him tightly so he rubbed your back "I'm okay baby, I'm perfectly fine." so calming a bit from his words, you pulled away to look at him "What the heck happened?" you said inspecting him more, and seeing he's covered in soot. "Just got caught up in a fire." Ryan said like it wasn't a big deal so you gave him a deadpan look "You make it sound like it was nothing." Ryan chuckled "It really wasn't" "Try saying that if it was me in the fire." you said shaking your head and Ryan immediately came to realization "So are you cleared to leave?" you asked looking up at Ryan and he nodded "I just had to wait on an escort." Ryan said smiling down at you and you chuckled "Gosh, I almost had a heart attack." you said as you both left. Ryan signed out and you headed to the car "Was it just you?" you asked as you both were in the car now, so Ryan shook his head "No, Calleigh was with me." "And she's okay?" you asked and Ryan nodded "She got cleared as well. Delko came for her." that made you smile widely and Ryan did not miss that "What's with that smile, is something going on between them?" you just chuckled and shrugged "Maybe." Ryan turned to you "And that's all you're giving me?" Ryan asked and you just nodded.
        </p><br>
        <p class="story">
            You both got home now, and Ryan let you know that he was going back to work and to don't argue with him on it. So you just decided to iron fresh clothes for him while he went and showered. "I think you wearing white, might be bad luck." you said as you watched Ryan get dressed "What makes you say that?" Ryan asked and you thought before giving him your reasons "Well, I'm not a superstitious person, but I can see where you're coming from." he said as he tied his tie. "Look good?" Ryan asked turning to you so you nodded "Perfect." so he approached you capturing your face in his hands and he saw the look in your eyes, they still held concern "I promise babe, I'm fine." he said reassuring you so you sighed "Well let me be the wife that worries a little, cause my husband could have been seriously injured today, or worse." "But he wasn't." Ryan said making you smile so you rolled your eyes "Fine, you win." he chuckled before capturing your lips "Ready to go?" you asked Ryan, cause you had to drop him back to work and he nodded "Yes mam.". You guys shared one more kiss before leaving.

            Calleigh wasn't as lucky as Ryan to get out the smoke unscathed because later while she was interrogating a suspect she went down not being able to breathe, and Eric was with her when it happened, so immediately an ambulance was called for her and she was rushed to the hospital. How things were looking in that moment, she wasn't doing too well and they weren't sure if she was going to make it and Eric was there the whole time looking on, in constant panic and worry. When they were able to get her under control or somewhat stable she was placed in a room hooked to a machine to help her breathe, and Eric was with her the whole time. Alexx was the doctor that worked on Calleigh and told Eric that it was okay if he stayed by her side. While with her Eric remembered what you told him, so he started spilling his heart to her "You know, I talk to Heather a lot about you. She scolds me for not making a move on you, because she says we're perfect for each other. And you know what, she was right." Eric continued spilling out his heart and came to a realization, he's not helping you just sitting here so remembering that it's your off day he gave you a call, and asked you to come and replace him "Of course." you quickly got dressed and headed there. Upon entering the room you both quickly engulfed in a hug, Eric was hurting and you felt that "You know I should of listened to you." Eric said making you chuckle, pulling away to look up at him "Well, she's going to wake up eventually, then please finally tell her." you told him sternly and he nodded "I will." you talked for a bit before he left returning to work and you remained with Calleigh till when he returned.

        <p class="story">
            While with Calleigh, the others called you from time to time to see how she's doing and Ryan also called to personally check up on you along with Calleigh. "Are you sure you're okay, and not having a delayed reaction like Calleigh?" you asked Ryan, concern returning once again "I'm fine. I not too long chased the guy that tried to kill Calleigh and I, so if I were having any lung or breathing problems, it would have appeared while running." you listened and Ryan was correct so you sighed feeling relieved. "Okay, well get back to work and I'll hear from you later." "You got it beautiful." you both said bye before hanging up and you turned back to Calleigh, updating her that the guy was caught.
        </p><br>
        <p class="story">
            You were just coming back from the bathroom when you entered Calleigh's room seeing her open her eyes, so you immediately left calling for Alexx, to let her know that Calleigh was awake, and the moment she came, you pulled out your phone calling Eric, and he wasted no time in coming to the hospital. So after getting checked out and to find out that she would be okay, you talked with Calleigh and Eric a bit before leaving, giving them their personal time. You squeezed Eric's shoulder, giving him a look "Don't make me hurt you." you said and he knew exactly what you meant. Calleigh let Eric know that she heard everything you guys talked about so Eric chuckled before explaining it all. You left that hospital with a smile on your face knowing that your work here is done.

        <p class="story">
            Ryan went and visited Calleigh before coming home to you at the end of his shift. "Hey babe." Ryan said coming in but was met with silence, so entering the apartment he called again before heading off to the bedroom. Then he saw you stretched out across the bed sleeping, so smiling he took off his tie and pulled out his shirt, before going to lay beside you, matching your position. Ryan just laid there staring at you, looking over your features for a while with a faint smile on his lips before sleepiness over took him.
        </p><br>
        <p class="story">
            You were the first to wake up and upon opening your eyes, you weren't expecting to see Ryan laying across from you sleeping. So a smile immediately appeard on your lips as you looked him. For Ryan to just come and fall asleep like this, you know he must have been pretty tired and you know for a fact that he had a really long day. You decided that you both deserve a relaxing bath so slowly getting up, you headed to the bathroom to fill the tub. While you were watching the water and making sure the temperature was good Ryan woke up and saw that the space next to him was empty but he heard water running in the bathroom. So he sat up to catch himself before getting up and heading your direction. "Hey" Ryan said as he stood in the door way of the bathroom making you look up towards him with a wide smile "Hey, how are you feeling?" you asked getting up after turning off the tap. "Tired." Ryan said smiling down at you as you approached him and took you in his arms "You did had a very long day, hence the bath." you said and Ryan smiled at the gestured "I hope this isn't a solo bath?" Ryan asked with a raised brow so you shook your head "Of course not" you said smiling at him and that caused his eyes to soften before pecking your lips. "So shall we?" Ryan asked smiling down at you and you nodded "Lets" you said making him chuckle before you both got ready for the bath.
