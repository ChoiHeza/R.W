        Ryan made sure to wake up before you because it was your anniversary,
        and he wanted to make breakfast for you both. When you woke up, with
        eyes still closed, you reached across your hand for Ryan but felt
        nothing, so opening your eyes, you realized his side was empty. "Babe?"
        you called out but heard nothing, so with a stretch you sat up and made
        sure your body was fully awake before getting out of bed. You went to
        the bathroom first incase Ryan was there, but no he wasn't so you
        figured he was in the kitchen. While there you decided to wash one time
        before heading out.

      <p class="story">
        Nearing the kitchen you heard singing, making a smile grace your face
        because Ryan rarely sings. Reaching the entry way, you paused to watch
        the scene that unfold in front of you, Ryan had his back turned facing
        the stove and it smelt like pancakes. So with a full on grin now, you
        continued walking and made your way over to Ryan "Good morning husband."
        you said wrapping your arms around him while placing a kiss on his
        clothed back making him startle a bit "Hey, good morning beautiful."
        Ryan replied before stopping what he was doing to turn and look down at
        you "Happy Anniversary my love." he said with grin making you match his
        expression "Happy Anniversary to you too." you said and you guys shared
        a kiss "Happy?" Ryan asked and you rapidly nodded making him chuckle
        "And that's not because I heard you singing." you commented making
        Ryan's eyes widen "You heard that?" he asked and you nodded "I did and
        it was beautiful." you stated before reaching up on your toes to give
        Ryan one more peck. "Well, you wasn't supposed to hear but thank you.
        Ready for breakfast?" you nodded at that stepping out of his arms. "So
        go, sit and look pretty while I serve you." Ryan said making you giggle
        "Yes sir." you saluted before doing as told.

        Entering the ladies room to wash your hands, you saw Natalia was already
        there "Hey." you both greeted each other with smiles and you guys chat
        for a bit "Did you get a chance to meet the new M.E.?" Natalia asked and
        you shook your head "Not as yet, what's she like?" you asked curious and
        Natalia chuckled "According to Eric, she's cute." your eyes widened at
        the response "Chemistry is there already?" and Natalia shrugged "Who
        knows, seems like they were flirting already." you hummed taking in this
        info "Interesting." "By the way, happy anniversary!" Natalia said
        cheeringly before pulling you into a tight hug which you returned "Thank
        you." you said with a wide smile "So any plans?" you nodded "H gave us
        the next three days off as a gift so we booked a hotel room for those
        days to just get away, no work, no responsibilities, nothing." you said
        with a happy sigh thinking about the moment to come and Natalia smiled
        "That sounds perfect actually. Well, I got you guys something. I'll give
        it at the end of our shift." "Ah really, you didn't have too but thank
        you." you chuckled "It's nothing." you guys talked some more before
        leaving, heading back to work.
      </p>

      <p class="story">
        "Hey babe, any luck with finding surveillance footage?" Ryan asked
        entering the lab as you worked at the surface computer "Not as yet, but
        there was an atm nearby so I was just about to check that." you said
        beginning to pull it up and Ryan came next to you with folded arms "By
        the way, Natalia said she has an anniversary gift for us." Ryan looked
        towards you surprised "She remembered?" you nodded "She did, we'll get
        it at the end of the shift." just as you said that, the footage finished
        loading "It's not that clear." you commented feeling bummed "That's
        okay, it may still be helpful, look to see if you could find the license
        plate." Ryan said and you nodded looking "Sure." while searching H
        entered the lab "Mr. and Mrs. Wolfe, any luck on identifying the
        driver?" you shook your head "No, we can't see him in the footage, so
        we're aiming for the next best thing." you replied "The license plate."
        Ryan continued and just then it came to view "Okay, let's see who it
        belongs to." you said running the plate, and when the results came back
        a puzzled look crossed your face "It's not registered." you said but
        Ryan knew what that meant "It’s a cold plate." he stated "Cold plate or
        not, let's find it. Put out a bolo on the plate number and car type."
        you both nodded at Horatio's order before he left "You got it." you
        replied doing as said and at the same time Ryan turned to look at you
        "Never heard of cold plates before?" "I have but never in that kind of
        terminology, so I just learnt a new phrase." you said quickly giving
        Ryan a smile "So cute." he smiled to himself, before giving you a quick
        temple kiss "Later." he said leaving "Yeah." you replied back.

        "Sooooo…" you started while turning towards Eric "I heard you found the
        new M.E. cute." you said with a raised brow and Eric chuckled "Who told
        you?" you shrugged "Someone, names aren't important. But what I want to
        know is, was there flirting?" Eric shook his head and sighed before
        replying "Apparently there was, but I had no idea, and it wasn't from my
        side, I think." you chucked at that "He thinks. So Calleigh?" you asked
        truly curious "I don't know. I still love her but I don't know." Eric
        said truthfully and you nodded understanding "It's okay, I understand.
        You're afraid of ruining what you have now with her." "Exactly." you
        both shared a sad smile "Well, whatever you choose to do, I'll support
        you one hundred percent, and if you ever want a wing girl, my offer
        still stands." you said pointing towards him causing Eric to laugh and
        at that exact moment, Natalia entered the locker room "Suspicious." she
        said in a joke voice directed towards you and Eric. "Not suspicious."
        Eric said turning back to his locker "Says the suspicious guy." Natalia
        commented making you laugh so while Natalia's back was towards you guys,
        Eric looked at you and pointed over his shoulder towards Natalia "Was it
        her?" he mouthed and you nodded in reply. Before anything else was said
        Ryan and Calleigh entered the locker room "Did you catch them again
        Natalia?" Calleigh asked referring to you and Eric "I did, and on her
        anniversary, for shame." Natalia tsked causing Calleigh's head to whip
        around "Who's anniversary?" "Ryan and Heather." Natalia stated and a
        wide smile appeared on her face "That's today, I had no idea. Happy
        Anniversary guys." "Thank you." both you and Ryan replied with smiles
        "How much years is it now?" she asked looking between the both of you
        "Four years of marriage." Ryan replied with happiness laced in his voice
        "That's so amazing." you guys continued to talk, and they asked about
        you and Ryan and your plans for the special moment.

      <p class="story">
        "How much time do we have left till check in?" Ryan asked as you both
        entered the apartment so checking your watch you replied "Two hours."
        Ryan nodded "Enough time to shower and finish pack." you agreed and you
        both headed to the bedroom "What else do you have to pack?" Ryan asked
        as he sat on the bed watching you move around "A dress for dinner, I
        couldn't decide this morning which one to take." you said opening the
        closet "Want my help?" Ryan asked leaning back on his hands "Please."
        you said taking out the dresses you had in mind, and showed each one to
        Ryan "The white one, it's my favourite." Ryan commented and you looked
        at it before turning back to him "You sure?" Ryan nodded "I'm sure
        sure." you chuckled at his reply putting back the others "White it is."
        you came over to the bed where your duffel bag was, placing the dress
        inside. After you paused thinking what else was there you had to get,
        but the touch of Ryan's hand on your arm pulled you out of your thought
        process. "What?" you asked and he just pulled you to stand in front him,
        hands moving up to capture your hips "Breathe for a second." you nodded
        and he pulled you down to straddle his lap "We don't have time for that
        now." you scolded and Ryan shook his head "Not what I was implying,
        we'll have plenty of time for that at the hotel. I just wanted you to
        breathe and calm that ADHD mind of yours." he said hands running up and
        down massaging your thighs so you smiled at the gesture "Do you know how
        happy I am to have three full days with you, no interruptions from work
        or responsibilities." you smiled at the thought, because it sounded
        amazing "It's just what we need." Ryan nodded "And I'm going to enjoy
        every second of it." he leaned up and pecked your lips but suddenly you
        remembered something jumping off of Ryan's lap, "What's wrong?"
        "Nothing, I just remembered Natalia's gift." you said going to retrieve
        the box before returning to the bedroom. With the box in hand, you sat
        next to Ryan on the bed placing the box between you two "I wonder what's
        inside." you said untying the ribbon "I hope a sex toy." Ryan joked
        causing you to laugh "I highly doubt that.". With the ribbon gone, you
        took off the lid. You were both faced with stuffing paper at the top so
        taking it off, you guys finally got to see the contents of the box,
        pulling each item out one by one "A bottle of wine, nice." you pulled
        out inspecting it before handing it to Ryan so he could see "Some candy
        and sweets." you chuckled reaching your hand back in "What's this?" you
        asked reaching for the last item and when you realized what it was your
        eyes widened "No she didn't." you said laughing, now Ryan was curious
        "What is it?" not wanting to keep him in suspense any longer you pulled
        it out and dangled it before his eyes and then they widened before a
        smirk took over "Handcuffs." Ryan chuckled taking them from you "Why
        would she think that we don't already own a pair, I am a police
        officer." Ryan's statement caused you to bring your finger up to your
        lips biting at the skin but Ryan caught on because he knew you so well
        "Spill." Ryan said pointing a finger towards you with cuffs still in
        hand so sighing you spoke "Was a girls night, and we were talking, and
        they mentioned being cuffed and I said we never did it which caused them
        to be surprised cause hello, you're an officer, but I said it's always
        been a fantasy of mine, so I guess she remembered that conversation."
        you said taking in Ryan's face looking for emotions "So wait, that's
        actually something you would like?" you slowly nodded "And here I was
        thinking that you wouldn't of liked it. So we could have been using
        these the whole time." Ryan was appalled "I guess we never got into a
        conversation about them before." Ryan rubbed his face cause he felt like
        he has been missing out on something amazing, then proceeded to lean
        over resting his face in his hands "And I'm a police officer for
        goodness sake, how did the thought never crossed my mind to ask you."
        Ryan said peeping through his hands to look at you and you shrugged, so
        sighing he went back into his hands "But it's not too late, going
        forward we can use them, starting from tonight." you said coming closer
        to him while resting your hands on his shoulder and that caused him to
        look up at you "After we get back from dinner." you moved even closer to
        him now by straddling his lap again, hands this time on his chest "While
        wearing my white dress, you could hand cuff me." hands rubbing back up
        going to the hair at the back of his head "And do all the things you
        want to do to me." his hands were on your hips now pulling you closer
        moaning "I love the sound of that." he said going to kiss your neck "We
        have a lot of time to make up for not knowing about the cuffs." you said
        pulling him away "We're definitely going to have some fun with them, but
        why did you stop me?" "Because, we have somewhere to be in an hour and
        forty minutes, and if we don't start getting ourselves together now,
        we'll be late to our get away and the fun." you said smirking, wiggling
        your eyebrows and Ryan laughed "Okay, let's do it and continue this…" he
        said squeezing your bum before continuing "After dinner." he whispered
        in your ear "You're such a tease." you said placing a kiss on his lips
        before getting up "Well, I learnt from the best." he said sending a wink
        your way before spanking your bum as you walked away.

      <p class="story">
        You guys arrived at the hotel with time to spare and checked in under
        Ryan's name because he's the one that made the booking. After you guys
        were clarified, a worker escorted you guys to your room, and telling you
        guys some info before leaving you both to enjoy. Entering the hotel
        suite, both your faces lit up "This is gorgeous." you said it and Ryan
        was thinking it. Ryan immediately lifted you up in his arms spinning you
        around causing you to giggle and the moment he set you back down, his
        lips were on yours in a passionate kiss. He pulled away giving you love
        filled eyes "We deserve this." you nodded bringing your hand up to
        stroke his cheek "We do." you giggled "So.. Where first shall we bless
        this suite? Ryan asked causing you to chuckle as his arms tightened
        around your waist "Let's start traditional." you said with a grin and
        Ryan raised his brow "The bed?" you nodded making Ryan chuckle before
        lifting you up to wrap your legs around his torso, heading in the
        direction of the bed. He tossed you down causing you to giggle "Think we
        have enough time, before we have to get ready for dinner?" you asked
        looking up at him as he came to hover over you, so he checked his watch
        before looking back to you "Well, it looks like there's only enough time
        for me to have an appetizer." you immediately brought your hands up to
        cover your face causing Ryan to laugh "Come on babe, don't be shy. You
        already know you're my favourite thing to eat." he said completely over
        you now, moving your hands from your face "So shameless." you said and
        Ryan shrugged "I know you love it." he said with a smirk "Just shut up
        and kiss me already." you smiled "Yes mam." he said wasting no more time
        and connecting his lips with yours.
      </p>
