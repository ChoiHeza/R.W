            "Don't forget that I booked reservations for tonight." Ryan said looking down at you as you tied his tie "For what time?" "Eight." you nodded finishing up with the tie "Okay, that means I can come home and get dolled up." you said chuckling finally looking up at Ryan "Let me pick the dress." Ryan suggested and you raised a brow at him "Why…?" you asked with suspicion "Because I have a vision in mind." the moment those words left his mouth you laughed "A vision?" you asked and Ryan nodded "Yes, and it would only work if you allow me to dress you." Ryan said taking you by the hips so you tilted your head to the side and thought for a moment before nodding "Okay, I'll indulge." you said smiling up at him and Ryan grinned leaning down to peck your lips "Thank you beautiful." "Just don't make me regret it." you said pointedly "You won't, trust me." "Okay." you said then you guys shared a kiss before separating, continuing to get ready for work.

            "Hey Heather." Calleigh said as she entered the lab "Hey hey." she came and stood next to you "There's some dashcam footage I was hoping we could through from this morning's scene." she said handing you the drive. "Sure." you plugged it in and got started. "The silver car there, can you enhance?" Calleigh asked pointing at the screen "Sure, let me see if I could get a clear image of the driver." you said clearing it up. The moment you guys saw who was driving, you both were taken by surprise. "That's Eric's father." you said and Calleigh nodded "It is." she said then started thinking "Okay, um, Heather, let's keep this between us okay. I want to talk to Eric first about this." Calleigh told you resting her hand on your forearm so you rested yours on hers "Of course. My lips are sealed." "Thank you." with that she got the info and left heading to talk to Eric.

            You were currently in the locker room getting your belongings because we had to head over to the office to work for the rest of the day. "Hey, ready to leave?" came Ryan's voice as he entered the room "Just about. Came to see me off?" you asked smiling looking towards him "Of course." he said coming to stand next to you "By the way, is something going on between Calleigh and Delko?" Ryan asked curious "What do you mean?" you asked closing the locker and turning towards Ryan "Right before Calleigh and I were going to process the silver car, I saw her and Delko outside the room arguing." Ryan commented and you figured you may have an idea what it maybe but it wouldn't be your place to say something so you shook your head "Nothing that I know about, but even if there's something wrong, you shouldn't get yourself involved." you warned him so he nodded "Okay, I won't." you offered a smile "Good. Now while I'm away please don't cause any trouble." you said pointing a finger at him and he chuckled "Yes mam." Ryan said with a nod "Good boy." you said before leaning up to kiss his cheek "Message when you get to the office." you nodded "I will." with that you both said your byes before you left.

            The day progressed unexpectedly, Eric helping his father escape from the authorities and that resulted in a car chase and Calleigh accidently shooting at Eric because she only realized too late. When Ryan arrived at the scene and Calleigh explained to him, he didn’t believe her. Eric and his father had to be hunt down, and they found the car in the everglades along with Eric and he was injured, and that ended with Eric in the hospital in critical condition.

            You were just finishing up at the office when you heard you phone rang, so you answered without looking at the caller ID "This is Heather Wolfe." "Hey babe." Ryan greeted you on the other end "Hey, you need something, I was just finishing up work here?" you asked Ryan as you started to pack your bag "Um, not really. I have some bad news." your heart instantly sank "What is it?" you asked pausing what you're doing "It's Eric, he's in the hospital, and he's in a pretty bad condition." "What happened?" "I'm currently at the hospital, I'll explain when you get here." you tried to calm your thoughts and regain yourself "Okay, I'm leaving now." you said into the phone continuing getting your stuff together but moving quicker than before "Okay, please be careful babe, and see you when you get here." "I will." with that you hung up and wasted no time getting out of there.
