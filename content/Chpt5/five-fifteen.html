            "So what are you going to do today?" you asked Ryan as he was still in bed watching you get ready for work "Not sure as yet. Might honestly just sleep." he said while turning to face you "I'm glad you're able to finally get rest." you said turning to him as well. "Sure you don't want to stay home and sleep all day with me?" Ryan asked making you chuckle "I wish but the software needs updating, so I have a lot of work to do today." you told him before turning back to the mirror. When finished you turned back to Ryan "Looks good?" so he leaned up resting on his elbow before gesturing to you "Spin around" Ryan said making you giggle, so you spun twirling your royal blue dress for him and a wide smile appeared on his face "Gorgeous." he replied so you walked over to the bed "Thank you." you smiled at him before bending down to peck his lips "I just got to put on my shoes and I'll be gone." you said making Ryan groan "Don't leave me." you laughed at that "You'll be fine baby. Evening will come and I'll be back home before you know it." Ryan sighed before laying back down. "Yeah yeah." "Just focus on resting." you said getting your black heels from the rack "Yes mam.". After your shoes were on, you went back over to Ryan "Okay love, it's time for me to go." you said making Ryan sit up to meet you at the edge of the bed, so he could take hold of you. "Don't miss me too much today." you said as he took hold of your waist and your hands captured his face looking down at him "You know that will be hard." that made you smile "Well try." he hugged your torso, and he held you there for a while before you guys shared kiss and then you left for the day.

            While Ryan was home getting some rest he got a call said that he was needed to come in because a case had to be reopened due to new evidence being found and all hands on deck were needed. So getting dressed, Ryan remembered that you wore before leaving so he decided to match your look. The moment he arrived he got to work, and decided when he gets the chance he'll go look for you, to surprise you.

            Passing by your lab he looked in and saw you with your tablet in hand looking between it and the surface computer. So with a smile on his lips he headed for the entrance giving it a tap to alert you of his presence "Hey Beautiful." you heard looking towards the voice and saw it was Ryan so a huge smile appeared on your face "Ryan! What are you doing here? Please don't tell me you actually missed me that much that you decided to come in to work?" you said raising a brow at him as he came towards you chuckling "Nah, I'm working on the case that was reopened, they needed all hands on deck." he said as he stood next to you "Oh yeah, I heard about that." "Yeah, but I donâ€™t mind, I get to see your beautiful face." Ryan said smiling towards you making you smile as well "He never quits." you said before turning back to your screens "Nope. So, what are you working on?" Ryan asked you looking on "I'm between working on another case and updating the software." you said with a sigh "Sounds like your hands are full." you nodded "Very, I should be getting someone to work along with me soon, I think he'll replace Cooper in some sense." you told Ryan and you guys talked some more before Ryan said he'll get out your hair.

            The case wasn't going so well the CSI team so Ryan decided to take matters in his hands and take one for the team by playing dirty as well like the suspects. That resulted in him losing his gun and badge for the time being but he did manage to get some photos "I've managed to get taken some photos, if you want, you can get Heather to check them out." Ryan told H while leaving his phone with his gun and badge on the table before leaving. So H handed the phone to Calleigh and told her to go to you with it and see what Ryan took. "Hey Heather." Calleigh said entering the lab "Hey Cal." you greeted back and she explained what happened with Ryan before handing you his phone "He really is an act first kind of guy." you said sighing while taking the phone from her "Well, let's hope it was for nothing." Calleigh said and you rested down the phone on the surface computer "Okay so let's get all the photos that Wolfe took of the car." you said pulling them up "Let's start with the broken tail light." you said displaying the image bigger "Yeah, it's bent outwards." Calleigh commented looking at the photo "That could only mean that someone had to break it from the inside. Question is, by whom?" you suggested inspecting the image more. Calleigh then turned to you and said that Ryan found a kind of prescribed drug in the car and that was the same drug that a witness used trying to off herself so your mind when into quick thinking "So you mean this could lead to kidnapping, since she's the main witness?" you asked looking towards Calleigh "I don't know, maybe. She's been missing since she's been checked out of the hospital." Calleigh said and you guys shared a look before turning back to the screen. "Do you see that?" Calleigh asked as something in the photo caught her eye "See what?" you asked her confused "Enlarge the photo, where the glass is broken out in the center." she said and you did "Let me enhance it." and just as you finished that, you both gasped "It's an eye." Calleigh said speaking first "It could be the witness." you said and she agreed "I was thinking the same thing, I'm going to put out a BOLO, thank you Heather." you shared a smile before she left.

            The case carried well into the night and Ryan got his gun and badge back, the girl was found and the correct people were arrested for the murder. Both you and Ryan got home exhausted that you both crashed on the couch "What an unexpected day that was" Ryan commented closing his eyes "I know right. By the way, ballsy move on your part." you told Ryan smacking his check with the back of your hand "It was risky, but it got us where needed." you nodded, he was correct cause then you guys wouldn't have found the girl and managed to find to right person "Thank you for that." you said turning to him and he turned to you "You saved a life today." "Just doing my job." his reply caused you both to share a smile. You both remained quiet for a while before Ryan was the first to speak up "I think we deserve a relaxing bath." your eyes lit up at that "That sounds perfect." the moment those words left your mouth Ryan lifted you up and headed off to the bathroom making you laugh.

            "Ryan." you called, making up lift up his head to look at you "Yes my love." you smiled tilting your head to the side "You looked really nice today." you commented "That's only because you looked gorgeous this morning." Ryan said with a smirk making you laugh "Come on babe, just take the compliment." "But I was just stating facts, because I dressed based on how you look this morning." the smile would not leave your face "I've realized and I don't see you wear the black jacket often enough. It looks really good on you." you said coming forward in the tub "Well, I could say the same about the dress you wore." Ryan said smirking while taking your hand and helped pulled you towards him. "Well, we both looked really nice today then." you commented now straddling Ryan's lap and he shook his head "I disagree." he said making you give him a puzzled look "I think we look nice every day, whether we're fully clothed or in the tub, naked, with our bodies against each other. I think that's when we look the best." you chuckled at his response before taking hold of his neck "That was smooth." you said feeling Ryan's hands gripping your hips pulling you even closer "What can I say, you turn me into a big flirt." he said with a wink "Well, I love it." you said truthfully smiling down at him and Ryan just looked at you taking in your features. "You truly are gorgeous." Ryan said as you felt his hands massage your body under the water "And you are truly gorgeous yourself." you commented back making Ryan laugh and shake his head "Not even close to you babe." before you had time to fight back Ryan captured your lips with his "Don't argue with me, cause that's a fight you won't win." he said before deepening the kiss, pulling you even closer against his body.
