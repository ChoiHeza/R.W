            "Jacket or no jacket?" Ryan asked as you were putting in your earrings "Well personally, you look really nice with the jacket, but since we live in Miami I'm going to leave that to you." you said turning back to the mirror but all Ryan heard was you liking the look, so he settled for the jacket. You looked at him chuckling while shaking your head. "You look beautiful." Ryan complimented you as you turned to face him "Why thank you. Whenever I wear white I feel like an official Miami citizen." you said chuckling and Ryan did as well "Well, you look like an angel." he said taking you in his arms by your waist "Well thank you babe." you smiled up at him before he leaned down to place a peck on your lips "We're still on for this evening?" Ryan asked as he tuck a hair behind your ear and you nodded "Should be, once the workday isn't too much." "I could get behind that. Ready to go?" Ryan asked as he released his hold on you, "Yes sir." with that you guys got your belongings and were out the door.

            A witness getting their statement taken, then turning into a crime scene is how Ryan started his morning. The building that Calleigh and Eric were in with the witness, got wrecked by a crane. So this is where Ryan was, in the crane box, looking for evidence he could find to help find out who's responsible. Entering the crane Ryan kept giving himself a peep talk "Don't look down, don't look down." his breath was heavy cause he clearly way too high off the ground "Hey Ryan, how are you doing up there, you're about two hundred feet?" came Calleigh's voice through the radio Ryan had "I'm doing great. In fact, queue the wind. I feel like a Wringly brother." Ryan said lying through his teeth, he could not have been more terrified "The contractor that's playing Mr. Innocent said that nobody's been up there all day. See if you see anything to the contrary." Calleigh said not catching on to Ryan's frightened state. So trying to catch his breath, keyword, trying, he began to look to see if he saw anything "No.. Cab's pretty clean." he said looking some more "The system's offline. There's a computer onboard which I'm guessing has an internal monitoring system." "You mean like some sort of a black box?" Calleigh asked looking up towards the crane "Yeah, that records every movement and action of the crane." Ryan said spotting his light on it inspecting the component. "He never said anything about that." "It's probably for good reason. You know what, I think I can jack into this and uh, bring the information back to the av lab." Ryan told Calleigh just before his life flashed before his eyes, the crane started to shake and make noises "Whoa, whoa, what is that?!" Ryan said absolutely terrified, breathing increasing "What was what?" Calleigh asked on the ground after hearing Ryan's panicked voice, but Ryan tried to cover it up "No, I said, what I said was, look at that. It's quit a view, what a time I'm having." Ryan said clearly not convincing Calleigh "It's okay to be scared you know Ryan." Calleigh said with a hint of laughter in her voice "I don't know what you're talking about. I'm not scared." Calleigh laughed now "Wait till Heather hears about this." Ryan shook his head while saying "No no. She won't hear a word of this." "I'll think about it." Just as Ryan was about to reply back something caught his eye "Calleigh, I think we got some blood up here." "Okay, take a sample after tapping into the box." Calleigh told him and after what happened just now, there is no way that Ryan is staying longer in this death box "You know what, I think I'm just going to remove it and uh, take it to Heather, she likes this kind of stuff." What Ryan said made Calleigh chuckle "Right, use your wife as an excuse." Ryan quickly got the sample and the box and was out of there.

            "Hey there beautiful." Ryan said as he entered the lab "Hey scaredy cat." you said trying to contain your laughter and avoiding his eyes, so Ryan sighed coming over to you "How did Calleigh get here before me." you chuckled and shook your head finally looking at Ryan "Wasn't her, was Eric." and Ryan ran a hand down his face sighing so you rest a hand on his arm "It's okay babe, I would have been terrified too." Ryan gave a look and you just laughed "So I heard you have something for me." you said holding your hand out and Ryan placed a black box in your hand "I was going to do it in the field but I remembered you love this stuff." you chuckled "Right, and not because you were terrified in the crane." you said connecting the black box to the surface computer "I'm leaving, because my wife keeps harassing me." Ryan said starting to walk away from you "You know it's all love baby." you said blowing him a kiss but he secretly caught it and placed it on his check. He mouthed an 'I love you too' before leaving.

            While you were accessing the box Natalia entered "Is that the data from the box, that Ryan got from the crane cab?" Natalia asked as she came next to you looking at the screen "Yup. It's a reason they call this the tattle tale system. There isn't much that it doesn't know about the crash." you told Natalia impressed "Like what?" she asked curious and you got to explaining while showing her "Too bad it can't show us who the operator was." Natalia said dishearten and you sent a smile towards her "It can." and you showed her, as you she looked on she saw something odd "But nothing's happening." she said referring to the controllers in the cab "Exactly! Meaning that those controllers weren't use during the crash." you said clarifying the point more and Natalia caught on "So the crane was being remotely operated." Natalia stated and you nodded "Yup. So they were never in that cab." "That means that it could have been operated from anywhere." you chuckled "Oh ye of little faith." and you got into explaining how the remote controlling system works. "So let's check out the surrounding area." you said pulling up the area around the crane "The remote would have to be in this area." you said pointing at the area on the screen "Okay, let's try to narrow in where they could have been." Natalia told you and you guys discussed, eliminating different possibilities. "There is a parking structure, just down the street." you said highlighting it and Natalia smiled "Perfect." she said then looked to you "Thank you Mrs. Wolfe." she said with a wink before leaving "Anytime hun."

            You were just entering back the lab when Eric met you at the entrance "Hey." you both greeted and entered together "There's something I want you to check out, if you don't mind." Eric said as you both walked over to your station "I don't, what is it?" you asked looking at him "It's the 911 call from our victim, when he heard the murder." you nodded "Okay, and what am I listening for?" "Anything in the background that could help us find the killer." "You got it CSI Delko." Eric chuckled handing you the drive that contained the audio "Thanks Heather, Calleigh should come by and see what you find." he said before leaving "Yes sir.". Connecting the drive to the surface computer, you got to work listening. It wasn't long before Calleigh entered "I just got the 911 tape from Eric, are we looking for something specific?" you asked looking at her and got to listing some things that could be helpful that we should listen out for. "Okay." with that said you hit play on the recording and you both listened in, but Calleigh heard something "What was that?" she asked "Part of the music maybe." you replied not hearing what she heard "I don't know. Can you isolate that noise?" "Yeah sure." you did as asked and isolated the noise before playing it again "Sounds like a toilet flushing." you said as you both listened and discussing and realizing that the victim wouldn't do it, that only left the killer "I'm no forensic scientist, but I would say that the shooter was cleaning the scene by flushing away any evidence." you said looking towards Calleigh and you both shared a smile "That's pretty good Heather, we gotta get back to the bathroom." she said mouthing a 'thank you' starting to leave but you halted her "Wait a minute." you said causing her to turn back "I heard what happened today, and I'm sorry." you said offering a smile with Calleigh returned "Thank you, you know we can't please everyone." "I agree, but I'm always here if you ever need someone to talk to." "Thanks Heather, I will take you up on that offer." you both shared a smile before she left.

            "Do you think we could stop home first?" Ryan asked as you both got your stuff from your lockers "Why?" "Natalia and I returned to the bathroom crime scene and we had to pull apart the toilet and pipes." you immediately caught on "Because the killer flushed the evidence." Ryan nodded "Exactly, and I think I may have gotten some of the sewage on me." Ryan said with a disgusted face "Well I donâ€™t smell anything." you said before inspecting him "Sure sure?" you nodded "Sure sure." smiling at him before taking your bag from the locker "Okay, we won't stop home then." he got his bag as well "Ready to go?" he asked turning to you after shutting his locker "Yes sir." with that you both made for the exit of the room. At that same moment Eric and Calleigh entered "Guys heading off?" Eric asked towards you too "Yeah, it's date night." "Well, have fun guys, see you tomorrow." Eric said and you all said your byes to each other before leaving.

            You guys just came from having dinner at a restaurant by the coastline and was currently walking along the shoreline. Hand in hand, your heels ditched and in your right hand as your left hand was intertwined with Ryan's. You guys were just talking from one thing to another just enjoying each other company "I'm telling you babe, when that box shook, my life flashed before my eyes." Ryan said making you laugh more "Although you were terrified, I think it was still very brave of you to go up there." you told him truthfully "Well, I didn't feel very brave." Ryan said looking down at you "Are you kidding me? Going up that high, knowing that you're partially scared of heights. I honestly could never. I think my body would pass out before I left the ground." you said causing Ryan to laugh "That reminds me of the time when we were first dating. I lifted you up suddenly and you screamed and nearly fainted." Ryan said chuckling at the memory and you joined "I remember, but it did take some time for me to adjust." then a glint crossed Ryan's eyes "I wonder." he said looking down at you mischievously, so catching on you said "Oh no Ryan." you said releasing his hand before taking off running and he laughed "Come on baby, how far do you think you're going to get?" he said shouting the last part as you got further from him but you weren't planning on stopping. Before you knew it Ryan caught you and lifted you up making you squeal "Gotcha." he said before placing your feet back on the ground so you sighed after turning in his arms "It was worth a shot." you said looking up at him "A very futile one." Ryan said looking down at you as his arms wound around your waist "So mean." you said smacking his chest "Me mean?! Heather, you were practically making fun of me this morning at the lab." Ryan said looking offended and you looked away from his stare "Maybeâ€¦" you said before meeting back his eyes making him smile down at you "What?" you asked and he shook his head "It's nothing really. I was just thinking about us." you tilted your head "What exactly about us?" his head moved side to side before motioning for you guys to continue walking hand in hand along the beach "How far we've come, from when we first met. We seemed so young back then, unsure of what the future had in store for us. But it was that one 911 call that you placed that brought us together sealing our future." Ryan said as he looked ahead thinking about that moment and it really caused you to think "Then we became friends." you chuckled then Ryan looked down at you "Which killed me by the way." "What do you mean?" you asked looking up him "I was very attracted to you, and I really really liked you back then." his reply made you smile "Is that why I caught you staring at me on multiple occasions." Ryan nodded not denying it "You were the most beautiful woman I had ever seen and I wanted to ask you out then and there but, I decided against it, because you just moved to Miami, and then finding out you were Ace, and finding out your personality it all clicked that I shouldn't rush things with you." this was your first time hearing all of this and your smile just kept growing "You know what's funny about that?" you asked and Ryan shook his head before you continued "I kept asking myself 'When is he going to ask me out?'" you chuckled looking up at Ryan and he looked really surprised "Really?!" he asked and you rapidly nodded "But it worked out for the best, because when we finally got together, it felt right." you said truthfully with a smile "I agree. And look at us now five years later, married and living our best lives." Ryan was correct, currently you both really are living your best lives and you wouldn't trade it for anything. Ryan continued while you were in your thoughts "And I was so stupid for gambling. It nearly cost me the best thing in my life." Ryan said halting your walking looking down at you "Ryan, that's the past." he shook his head "I know but, I want to say something about it." you nodded for him to continue "I was in it before I met you, and it was okay while we were dating, I didn't think anything wrong of it. But then when we got more serious, I found myself wanting to quit but it was an addiction and I knew I was in the wrong because I always lied about that part of my life. That's when I should have quit, the moment I started lying about it to you but then the debts caught up to me and I continued not stopping. We got married and I still had the habit and I guess that's where I took you for granted because I know you're so understanding, that if I told you about it you would help me and be there for me, but the selfish part of me didn't want to let it go. Then I got caught at work and I decided to come clean to you, and I promised you that I would stop, I even promised myself but of course it being a habit I was dragged back in, and I lied to you about it, why I came home late or went out, because I know you would have been mad, but the longer it went on the worst it got. Until I got fired and that hurt but not as much as losing you. If I knew the moment I met you that my gambling would have led to that, I would of quit there and then, but I guess something tragic had to happen for me to realize what I was doing was wrong. Every moment I lied to you, I hated it all and I don't know why I didn't quit sooner, but with the help, I've never felt better." you just listened as Ryan spilled his heart to you and not once did your eyes left his, and this action caused your heart to swell up, so without thinking you reached up on the tip of your toes and connected your lips with Ryan's, letting him know that you love him and have long forgiven him "It was a tough time, but guess what, we've grown from it and we're better than ever now." you said truthfully after you pulled away "But that could have been avoided if I just quit back then." you shook your head "It happened for a reason. I guess the lesson learnt was that there's someone out there besides ourselves that we care so much for, cause that time apart just made us love each other more after we got back together." Ryan liked how you worded it so he smiled down at you "Aren't you wise." before you could reply Ryan placed a quick kiss to your lips making you smile against it "I love you." he said against your lips "And I love you." you said sharing a deep kiss before pulling away and Ryan kissed your forehead before smiling down at you "Ready for the jacket?" you nodded chuckling and Ryan took off his jacket placing it on your shoulders while taking your heels from you to hold "Warmth." you said snuggling more in the jacket that practically swallows you making Ryan chuckle "Cute." he said before kissing your forehead once more "Ready to head back?" "Yes my love." you said chuckling and Ryan went in front you to bend over "What are you doing?" you asked confused "Hop on. I want to give you a ride." smiling to yourself, you hopped on his back and he took hold for your thighs before standing up "Feel comfortable?" Ryan said before moving off, he felt you nod "It's perfect." you said laying your head on his shoulder as he started to head back the direction you both came "Let me know when you're tired." "Won't be possible." he smiled to himself, and thought 'you've carried me a lot, now it's my turn to carry you'.
