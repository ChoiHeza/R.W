            Ryan's shift started before you cause he was needed, a random man with no memory was found walking around covered in blood. So you both drove separately that morning, so here you were in the locker room putting away your things. Just then Eric entered "Good morning." he said making you look towards him "Good morning, doing okay?" you asked and he nodded, well sort of "Just something been bothering me, I was planning to ask you actually, do you have plans for this evening?" you shook your head "None, why?" Eric smiled at that "It's been a while since we hung out, plus there's something I'll like to really talk about." he said hoping you would catch on to the topic he has in mind and of course you did "Of course, same spot?" Eric nodded "It's a date." you smiled towards him which he returned. With that you guys finished what you were doing and headed off to start your shift.

            "If it isn't my beautiful wife." you heard Ryan said as he entered your lab "What did you do?" you asked not looking away from the screen "What makes you think I did something?" Ryan asked coming next to you "It's the tone of your voice, plus I know my husband." you said before finally looking at him and he sighed "Well, I did nothing wrong. It's that Delko and I got into a little disagreement." "About what?" "The guy found covered in blood, I think he did it, but Eric thinks otherwise, it's like he's defending him almost." you listened to Ryan and thought for a moment before replying "Well, first you shouldn't jump to conclusions because your job is to follow the evidence then go from there, but you are entitle to your own opinion. With Eric now, I can see where he's coming from, because I think he sees himself in the guy, with the memory loss part, and feeling lost and confused." Ryan understood what you were saying but was curious about something, it was probably his pride that encouraged him to ask his next question "So who between us is right?" his question made you laugh "Are you serious right now Ryan? Neither of you are, being you're jumping to conclusions and Eric is making it personal, when both of you should just be following the evidence." Ryan sighed cause he knew you were right but it was hard for him to hear "Follow the evidence." he stated and you nodded repeating what he said "Follow the evidence." he nodded "As much as I hate to admit it you're right, so thank you." he said offering a smile which you returned "Always." you replied then remembered about the plans you made with Eric "I know this maybe weird to say because of what happened between you guys but Eric and I made plans for this evening, if that's okay?" you asked looking towards Ryan and he understood because he knows there's a special bond between you two and you guys confide in each other so he understands that and doesn’t come between it, because at the end of the day he trusts the both of you and cares for you both and they're struggles that only you two would understand that would be better to discuss with each other. Like when he was recovering from his gambling, he got help on that, someone else that would understand to help him get better and you supported him all the way, so he's going to support you too. "Of course babe, I don't mind." Ryan said with that sweet smile of his which made you chuckle "I love that you're understanding about this." you said tilting your head to the side "My wife is allowed to have a life outside our marriage and I know she loves helping people." Ryan said truthfully "If we weren't at work right now I would kiss you." Ryan chuckled before starting to look around "Well, the coast is clear, no one is around." you shook your head "But what if we get caught?" "For what, being married?" Ryan asked with a raised brow and you laughed  "Fine, but I'm just giving you a cheek kiss, to play it safe." you said with a pointed finger and chuckled "I'll take what I can get." he said before leaning his cheek closer to you puffing it out, so looking around quickly to make sure it was still clear, you leaned in and placed a kiss on his cheek and a smile immediately appeared on his face as he leaned back "I'm surprised you didn't turn your head last minute." you chuckled turning back to your screen "Well, the idea did cross my mind, but I wouldn't want us to actually get in trouble cause that would suck." he said before resting his hand on your lower back "I got to head back to work, I'll get to see you before you leave right?" you nodded "You will." "Okay, later." he said with a wink and a tap to your lower back before leaving.

            You guys arrived at your usual spot, which was a nice café by the beach that allows you both to share thoughts and also enjoy the atmosphere. You guys ordered your usual and got into talking while waiting for the drinks to arrive "Is something wrong, cause you looked pretty down this evening, or is it something pertaining to the case." you asked Eric with concern cause you could tell something was bothering him so he sighed before speaking "It's Calleigh. I confronted her about reading my therapy session file, and we got into talking before Frank showed up making the atmosphere awkward between us. Then back at the lab I approached her and apologized for how weird things got but she said she isn't believing or taking anything until she hears me says the words myself, about how I feel about her." you smiled at that "But isn't that a good thing? What did you say to that?" you asked leaning forward and Eric lowered his head "I didn't say anything." you looked at him in disbelief then thought for a moment "You're still scared of ruining what you guys have?" you asked and Eric nodded, just as you were about to continue your drinks were delivered so you thanked the waiter before he left then you continued "Okay, so let me ask you this, how do you feel about her?" Eric didn't had to think about his reply "I'm crazy about her but also her friendship means so much to me." "Okay, then let me paint you a picture, you both have such dangerous jobs, and let's say something happened to one of you and you never got a chance to tell her how you feel, would you regret not telling her?" you asked seriously and Eric thought for a moment before nodding "I would. It would hurt me to know I never got to tell her." so you sat back and smiled to yourself before taking a sip of your drink "Well, there's your answer." after your sip you continued "Try to live with the least amount of regrets as possible, but I can just give you advice cause it's all up to you and no matter what you decide I will support it but just know that one of the choices may result in physical pain from me. Just saying." you shrugged, chuckling at the end and Eric laughed "Thank you Heather, you have no idea how helpful you are." Eric told you truthfully "Well, that's what friends are for." you said raising your glass and Eric clinked it before you both drank, then you both laughed at the end.

            "Hey babe, I'm home." you said coming in through the door, resting down your bag then taking off your shoes. "Hey!" you heard Ryan called from the living room, so you made your way there. "Hey." you said with a grin entering seeing Ryan sitting on the sofa watching tv "Hey beautiful, wasn't looking for you to be back just as yet." Ryan said as you plopped down next to him and his arm immediately wrapped around you "Eric also had to go by his mom." you said before looking up at Ryan and giving him a kiss before going to lay on his chest "Everything okay?" Ryan asked and he felt you nod "Yeah, nothing's wrong, he just wanted a close friend to confide in." "Okay, and you're good right?" Ryan asked looking down at you making you look up at him "I'm perfect." you told him truthfully and Ryan believed you because if something was really bothering you, you would of told him. He kissed your forehead before you moved to get up "Have you eaten?" you asked looking at him and he nodded "Yeah, I cooked mac and cheese, and I left some for you." you smiled at him widely "The famous mac and cheese, I can't wait to eat it." you said making Ryan chuckle "I'll heat it up for you." you nodded getting up "Thank you baby, I'm gonna go shower." you said starting to walk away but Ryan took hold of your arm halting you. He pulled himself up before wrapping his arms around your waist looking down at you "I love you." he said making you smile "And I love you." you replied before he left a kiss on your lips. "I'll have the food ready for when you come out." Ryan said before letting go of you "Thank you." you said blowing a kiss his way before heading towards the bedroom.
