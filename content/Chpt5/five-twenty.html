            It was hours later when Ryan came to. He was bound to a chair, tortured and beaten, they even went as far as pulling out a tooth. It was the Russians that took him because Mark owed them money and he took too long to pay them so they decided to take it themselves and they wanted Ryans' help to release their guys when taken for the murder and theft. Ryan was refusing each and every time to help them so the Russian guy decided to pull his last card "Okay Wolfe, let me open your eyes for you." he said getting close into Ryan's face "You may not be worried for your safety but maybe the safety others you would like to keep alive and just remember, everything that I've done to you, I could do to them." The moment those words left the man's mouth, you entered his mind so Ryan decided to gave him his attention. They wanted him to stop their guys from being arrested for murder, he had to do anything possible to stop it, whether it be tampering with evidence or interrogating him in a way that he isn't at fault. Ryan agreed to do whatever it was they wanted. "Don't forget Wolfe, not a word of this to your team or even that wife of yours. Got it?" "Got it". Ryan obeyed not wanting to bring harm to anyone. After that they placed a bag over his head and released him in a random location where they had taken his vehicle. Once he realized they were gone, he took the bag off his head and searched his surroundings. Next to him was a paper bag which had his gun, badge, phone and a burner phone which they left for him to take orders from. So Ryan collected himself before getting into the hummer  and sat there. Immediately you crossed his mind and he hoped you left home already cause he doesnâ€™t want you seeing him covered in blood and beaten, so he got his phone and decided to give you a call.

            While you were getting dressed that morning, Mark called you and asked if you could drop school Billy for him since Ryan was still working and you told him "It wouldn't be a problem, I would love to." "Thank you so much Heather, I don't know what I would do without you guys." Mark replied. After you were dressed you left home and went for Billy. While driving Billy he was telling you about one of his classmates when your phone rang "Hold on a minute love, it's Uncle Ryan calling. Hey babe." "Hey Heather, have you left home already?" he asked you "Yeah, I have to drop school Billy." you told him and at that same moment Billy alerted his presence telling Ryan hello. Concerned immediately filled Ryan because Billy was the target "I didn't know you had to drop him." Ryan said trying to keep his voice calm "It was supposed to be you but you're working the double." Ryan just hoped that nothing happened to you both. "Okay babe, just be careful okay and I'll see you at work, bye guys." Ryan said and both you and Billy said your byes before hanging up. You found the conversation weird but thought nothing much of it and allowed Billy to continue back his talking.

            Arriving to his school you couldn't park in your usual spot so you had to park further away and walk him in. "Ready?" you asked looking back towards him and he nodded giving you a wide grin "Yes mam." you returned his smile and you both got out and walked hand in hand towards the school. After passing a white van you heard it opened but paid it no mind, and you wished you did because before you both registered what was going on, you and Billy were muffled being taken into the van and no one was near enough to hear your muffled screams. When in the van fully, someone knocked you out so you couldn't fight back anymore but they left Billy conscious and told him to keep quiet or they'll hurt you, so Billy quickly complied and not once took his eyes from you cause he was terrified and hoped you were okay.

            Ryan got home and tended to his wounds. He wiped away the blood from his body, used salt water for his missing tooth, treated any cuts he had. After getting cleaned up he got dressed and headed off to work knowing he can't mess up cause lives are literally at stake and he just hopes one of them weren't yours.
        </p><br>
        <p class="story">
            He arrived at the scene along with Calleigh and Delko and listened on to the guy that called it in, statement, before they got to work. Ryan made sure to move carefully and remove any main evidence that would link back to the killer meanwhile still doing his job and not causing suspicion. After Ryan left Delko on the roof to head back to the lab, Delko started surveying the landscape because the killer jumped but he wanted to know where, so he made sure the city plans were sent to the lab before giving you a call, but your phone kept going to voicemail, so he called Dave instead. "Hey Dave, is Heather there?" Delko asked him "Hey, I haven't seen her as yet, which is odd cause she's always the first one here." When Dave said that Delko turned around hoping Ryan was still there but he left already "Maybe she's sick, I'll ask Wolfe but I need you to do something for me." Delko said before getting to work.

        <p class="story">
            After processing the scenes they head to the lab and Ryan made a beeline for your lab hoping you were there, cause a part of him is expecting the worse. Passing by he only saw Dave so he tapped the glass before entering, making Dave look at him "Hey Ryan." "Hey, um where's Heather?" Ryan asked and Dave shrugged "I'm not sure, I haven't seen her for the morning. You're the second person to ask for her. Delko was first." Ryan's heart sank instantly so he pulled out his phone before leaving the room, leaving Dave puzzled. He dialed your number but it went straight to voicemail and just what Ryan had feared may have come to fruition.
        </p><br>
        <p class="story">
            Just as Ryan and Delko were about to question the main suspect, Ryan's phone rang "I got to take this." Ryan said starting to walk away "What now, is it Heather?" Delko asked looking at him so Ryan decided to lie "Yeah." Ryan said not giving any more of an explanation before walking away. It was the Russian guy that took him, letting him know that the main suspect is one of theirs and to let him walk. "I can't do that." Ryan said to the guy but he had his way "Then let me give you some initiative." the guy said before hanging up and Ryan's phone vibrate signaling he got a message, so opening it, he saw it was a video of you and Billy being held hostage. You were unconscious and all the blood drained from Ryan's face. They had you and it was his fault, so having no choice, he did everything the Russians wanted. Delko was not happy with Ryan on how the interrogation went because it resulted in the killer walking, but for you and Billy's sake, it had to be done.

            Ryan was in the lab processing some evidence he collected from when he was taken hostage when he got a call from Mark. He explained it all to Mark and told him to get somewhere safe, that he'll handle it. "Omg, I dragged them into this." Mark said feeling instantly worried and awful "Just stay calm and don't go looking for them." Ryan warned him "Who is it, the Russians?" Mark asked "Yes, it's the Russians and I know what they want, all I have to do is stall them." he said and at that last part Calleigh entered the lab so Ryan immediately hung up "You need to stall, what does that mean?" she asked curious "Just some family stuff." Ryan said smiling to not bring up suspicion but Calleigh already knows something is going on "Okay, I don't like to pry, but I'm going to. What's going on, I've noticed your lip and it looks like you're missing a tooth. Did you get into a fight?" Calleigh asked truly concerned and Ryan shook his head making up some lie about dentist trouble but Calleigh still didn't buy it "Are you sure? Is something going on between you and Heather because I haven't seen her at work and I'm not reaching her cell." Ryan tried his best to play it off once more "No, we're perfect but she's currently home not feeling well and just getting rest." Calleigh could sense that Ryan was still lying but decided to drop it for now and gave him a smile "Okay." she said before starting talking about work and Ryan was thankful for that.
        </p><br>
        <p class="story">
            Ryan and Calleigh had to go through some prints so he took this as his chance to fabricate a print and pin the murder on the security guard, and while Ryan was doing that Calleigh decided to go and talk to H cause she knows something is wrong with Ryan. "What's wrong Calleigh?" H asked turning to Calleigh and she sighed before replying "Something is off about Ryan today." "What do you mean, like gambling?" H questioned and Calleigh shook her head "The behaviour is the same when he was hiding it but I don't think that's it, he wouldn't do that to Heather." "Have you heard from her?" "That's the thing, I haven't, she's not at work, and none of us are getting through to her. Ryan said she's sick but I think something else is up." H nodded "Okay, I'll talk to him and take care of it." "Thanks Horatio." Calleigh said with a smile before walking away because she's worried for you and has a bad feeling.

        <p class="story">
            After questioning the security guard, Delko and H approached Ryan and told him of what happened, that he's the killer. While the two were talking to Ryan they noticed his odd behaviour "Keep me posted gentlemen." H said before walking away and Delko gave Ryan a look.
        </p><br>
        <p class="story">
            Mark came up to the station making noise talking about Billy and H showed up "Lt, thank god, Ryan told me Heather and Billy has been taken." Mark said coming towards H "Mr. Gantry as I recall, you and your son were not supposed to be in town." "We did, and we left but then I found out that Ryan took over my debt and I couldn't live with that. So I got back a few days ago and he called and said that they have Heather and Billy. I just don't understand what's going on." so H pulled out his phone to call Ryan "Well, that makes two of us." he said before putting his phone to his ear "Have a seat please, have a seat." he told Mark before turning away "Mr. Wolfe, where are you?".
        </p><br>
        <p class="story">
            Ryan and H met and Ryan showed him the video of you and Billy that the Russians sent him and he explained everything to H that occurred "They told me if I didn't interfere with the investigation they would kill them both, and H I know what I did looks really bad but this is Billy and my wife on the line and you know I would do anything to keep them alive." Ryan told H truthfully cause deep down he was hurting "But you stopped an investigation." H told him "No, I paused it and I will face any consequences that come my way once they're back safe because they're watching my every move. So what to do?" H thought for moment "Okay, just leave it to me." H told him before walking away but Ryan halted him "Heather has a tracking device in her necklace, you can use it to find them." Ryan said before giving him the info and H left going to investigate.
        </p><br>
        <p class="story">
            Ryan continued to work as normal while H worked on finding you and Billy. Doing the detective work he went about it smartly so that when you guys were found, the guys responsible would be arrested for what they did. After finding where you guys would be, he got the main suspect to help him get in because he caught him burying the cash where Ryan said he was being held. Arriving at the abandoned building, H went into stealth mode and at that same time the Russian called Ryan "This is Wolfe." he answered "I thought we had an understanding." the man stand so Ryan made sure he moved away from hearing ears "Listen, your guy is free, I did what you asked. I thought that was the deal?" Ryan was starting to get concerned "Who says I only have one guy?" the Russian was moving back and forth keeping his eyes on you and Billy, you both were currently tied up being held in a bathtub "Okay, then give me the information, who is the other guy?" Ryan asked not wanting to anger the man "It's too late, now you deal with the consequences." the man said then instantly, fear entered Ryan's heart "No no no. Listen to me, I have done everything you've asked me to do, everything!" Ryan said shouting the last part "No! You haven't Mr. Wolfe!" the guy said reaching for his gun before continuing "You've only made things more difficult." Ryan's heart was in his hand at his point "Please, just tell me what to do." Ryan begged "I should of killed you when I've had the chance." the man said to Ryan while walking over to you and Billy "The deal's off." the guy said before lowering his phone and Ryan heard the gun cocked, knowing what's about to happen, he kept yelling 'no' into the phone catching the attention of other workers around him. The guy pointed the gun towards you and Billy so you moved your body in a protective mode towards Billy so that if the guy shoot, it would hit you and not him. While still listening on the phone, Ryan heard a gunshot gone off and the world around him stopped along with his heart so he instantly fell to his knees and kept shaking his head, cause running through his mind was that you were just killed and he didnâ€™t know how to process it. But it was H shooting the man so he quickly picked up the phone "Hang on Mr. Wolfe, Heather and Billy are you guys okay?" H asked you both and when Ryan heard that, he didn't realized that he stopped breathing so the air that entered his lungs felt like a huge weight lifted off his shoulders because he thought he just lost you. After letting H know you both were okay, he untied you guys "Mr. Wolfe, we're coming home." H said getting you both out of there quickly before reinforcements showed up. After hearing that a smile appeared on Ryan's face, "They're okay, they're okay." Ryan kept telling saying to try and ground himself.

        <p class="story">
            After knowing you and Billy were safe Ryan, went to Calleigh and Delko to give them the main piece of evidence and they were mad at him for what he did "Well, my wife and a kid's life were on the line, so yeah, I did what I had to." Delko and Calleigh understood immediately "Why didn't you just tell us?" Calleigh asked and Ryan shook his head "I didn't want to risk anything, the moment it's the love of your life's life on the line, you forget how to function and you don't think clearly. All going through my mind was bringing them back home safe." Ryan said and Calleigh and Delko shared a look cause they understood.
        </p><br>
        <p class="story">
            H had you and Billy with him when Mark approached first and engulfed Billy in a hug before you "Thank you so much, and I'm so sorry, this is all my fault for what happened, it was never supposed to go down this way. Ryan wasn't supposed to take on my debt for me." that last part caught you because you knew nothing about that but nonetheless you hugged him back reassuring him that it's okay, after a few more words he left with Billy and H turned to you "How are you doing?" H asked sincerely and inspecting you "Honestly, I don't know how to feel, just moments ago I thought I was going die but what kept going through my mind was keep Billy safe." you told him truthfully looking towards him and before he had a chance to reply you heard your name "Heather!" it was Ryan and he quickly approached you guys, and the moment he was in front of you, he engulfed you in a bone crushing hug because he was so close to losing you and he don't know what would of happened if he did "Are you okay?" Ryan asked pulling away inspecting you and you nodded "I'm spotless." you told him easing his heart and he pulled you back in for another hug before turning to H "Thank you H, for bringing back my wife to me." Ryan said truthfully giving H a very thankful look "She's one of us, and none of us gets left behind." H told him giving you both a smile. Ryan pulled you into his side before kissing your temple just feeling so happy that you're with him "I want to go to bathroom before leaving." you said looking up at him and he nodded "Need company?" Ryan asked making you laugh "No, I can do that myself." you told him before walking away and Ryan watched you leave, then him and H remained there in front the building "Why do you think the Russians went after me?" Ryan asked looking towards H "Because they sensed an opening but they underestimated you didnâ€™t they." H said looking back at him and Ryan agreed "But Heather was never their original target." Ryan told him before looking off in the distance "And that was their mistake." H said making Ryan look back at him "H, they're trying to break us." Ryan said with concern "Well I say, bring it on." H said before putting on his shades and heading back into the building.

        <p class="story">
            Arriving home you remembered what Mark mentioned about his debt but you decided to ask Ryan about it later "I thought I lost you, when I heard that gunshot." Ryan said pulling you into his embrace after you both had your shoes off. "I thought the same as well when I heard it, but the feeling never came." you told him truthfully and he just pulled you into him tighter. "I don't know what I would of done if I lost you." Ryan said pulling away capturing your face in his hands so you smiled up at him "You don't have to think about it because I'm still here." you told him hoping to stop his mind from thinking the worst "But for a moment I thought you weren't." you saw the fear and pain starting to take hold in his mind so you leaned up and placed your lips on his offering him a tender kiss, just to remind him that you're here "I am here Ryan, and you're holding me and I'm touching you." you told him as you started to touch the features on his face as his hands went to wrap around your waist. This action helps him calm down so you did it until he opened his eyes releasing a sigh so you smiled up at him "Better?" you asked and he nodded "Let's go take a bath, I want to forget today." Ryan nodded smiling before kissing your forehead.
        </p><br>
        <p class="story">
            You both were currently in the tub sitting across from each other "Want to explain the missing tooth?" you asked gesturing to yours and Ryan shook his head "It's nothing." you raised a brow and tilted your head "Bullshit." you said and Ryan's eyes widened cause you're never one to use language so he chuckled before explaining "I got tortured because I refused to help them." you winced at that "Was it bad, and please be honest." so Ryan explained it all from the beginning of his kidnapping and your heart hurt hearing the pain he suffered, so you moved forward to take hold of him "I'm sorry you went through that." you said while inspecting the injuries on his body and giving them kisses "Once it's to keep you alive, I would do it all over again." Ryan said truthfully wrapping his arms around your waist pulling you closer. Then you remembered something "I need you to be honest with me on something." Ryan nodded "I heard Mark said you took over his debt, that's why they targeted you and Billy, what's going on?" you asked and Ryan sighed contemplating if to be completely honest and you saw that he was thinking it "No more secrets Ryan, I know you're doing it to protect me but look what happened." Ryan knew you were correct, you were involved in it even though he didn't want you to be "That time when Mark called me saying he wanted help, it was the Russians that we attacking him. So going there not knowing the situation, I intervened not knowing that I made myself a target for them. So H and I told Mark to get him and Billy out of town and start over fresh somewhere. While he left I decided to take on his debt so he wouldn't have anything to worry but he found out and came back." Ryan sigh so you remained silent for a moment thinking and Ryan took your silence as you being mad at him "Are you mad at me?" his question made you look up at him and you shook your head "I'm not, because I understood why you did it." you offered a small smile to him and Ryan was very thankful for that cause he promised you no more secrets between you two "Well, since you're involved now I guess I won't be hiding it from you anymore." he said smiling down at you "I love you and I'm sorry you got caught up in this mess." you took his face between your hands "For good or bad, for better or for worse." you said reciting your vows "No matter what happens, I'll always be by your side." you told him truthfully and Ryan just looked at you with so much love before connecting your lips together.
        </p><br>
        <p class="story">
            A part of Ryan still hated himself for what happened to you but eventually he knew it was out of his control so that night Ryan held you like you were gonna be taken away from him, because after coming close to losing you, he needs to keep you closer to him more than before.
