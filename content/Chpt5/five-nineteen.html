            "You haven't forgotten that I'm working a double shift right?" Ryan asked looking down to you as you tied his tie so you shook your head "I haven't because we had to cancel dinner plans for tonight." you said with a pout making Ryan chuckle "I'm sorry, but I always make it up to you, don't I?" Ryan asked with a tilt of his head, so when you finished with his tie you smoothed it down before looking up at him "You do." you said then Ryan placed a quick peck to your lips before walking away "Maybe I should put in a double shift as well to keep you company?" you suggested and Ryan turned to look at you "As much as I would love that, I would tell you no. Because I want you to get your rest and to be on your feet for that long, I wouldn't want that for you baby." that made you smile "Well, one of these days I will do it and you can't say no." you said with a pointed finger and Ryan took hold of it before giving it a kiss "Sure babe." you just shook your head. You both finished getting ready before leaving for work.

            You entered the lab and saw Eric and Ryan in front the other surface computer "If it isn't my favourite guys." you said going over to your station making them look towards you with smiles "Hey babe." Ryan greeted first "Heather, did you hear about Ryan and his new furry friend?" Eric asked and you raised a brow "No I haven't. Please do tell." you said completely intrigued "It's nothing. It really isn't" Ryan tried protesting but you and Eric weren't having any of it, so he told you of the dog that Ryan encountered when trying to retrieve the potential weapon used in the attack. Both you and Eric shared a laugh "You poor thing." you said turning to Ryan and he had a smile on his face "We came to do work." he said looking to Eric making you laugh more "Do your work, I'll be over here." you chuckled turning back to your desk. Eric and Ryan started going through the photos from the paparazzi camera so you blocked them out. "That's Calleigh." you heard Eric said making you look up to their screen, and it was a photo of Calleigh with a guy horseback riding. "Who's that guy she's with?" Ryan asked Eric "A horse trainer from an earlier case." Eric said inspecting the photo, you were in the background listening on "So Cameron wanted pictures of a famous horse?" Ryan asked trying to understand "Or maybe the trainer?" Eric commented, then he asked Ryan for the date on the picture and he pulled it up "Two months ago." Ryan told him but Eric remained quiet "Alright, let's keep looking." Ryan said resuming going through the photos "Looks like you got some competition." Ryan commented and you just shook your head cause you know that man of yours can't help himself, and that resulted in them having a bicker "Guys?" you said getting their attention and they both looked your way and saw you had a raised brow so they apologized before turning back to their screen. While going through the photos they both saw something unexpected "Hold on a second. Take a look at this, he just isn't taking photos of Calleigh. He's taking photos of all of us." Ryan said as he scrolled through them, then it landed on a photo of you and Ryan's heart dropped "Heather" he just said to no one in particular but you thought he called you "Yeah?" you asked looking up towards them and Ryan looked at you with a worried expression "What's wrong?" you said moving, going towards them. They didn't say anything, instead moved so you could come between them to see the screen and when you looked you saw why they were quiet "Is that me?" you asked completely confused "What's happening?" you asked looking between two of them and Ryan was the first to speak "The CSI team is being watched." as Ryan said that, you started to look through the photos yourself and saw everyone from the team was there "But why am I here, I'm not CSI." you stated then passing a photo, Eric stopped you to display it "I'm assuming it's because you're married to one." it was a photo of you and Ryan out on one of your date nights. Then you and Ryan shared a look, there was worry written on his face, in fact that expression was on all your faces.

            You were in the locker room getting your belongings before heading off to the office to work for the rest of the day. "Hey." you heard Ryan's voice as he entered the room so you turned towards him with a smile "Hey, came to see me off?" you asked and he nodded "Yeah, plus I won't get to see you tonight." Ryan said as he approached you "How are you feeling?" Ryan asked as he leaned against the locker next to yours "What do you mean?" you asked with a tilted head "From seeing those photos." he said looking at you with soft eyes searching your face for any expression it gave "Well at the moment, a bit weirded out but I'm trying not to think about it." you told him truthfully "I wish I could stay by your side twenty four seven just to make sure you're safe all the time." Ryan said leaning his head against the locker and that made you smile "I know you would, but I will be okay. Plus if I ever went missing, I think people would notice, especially you so I'm not too worried about being snatched." you said trying to lighten the mood but Ryan didn't approve "Don't even joke about that babe. I would lose my mind if you got kidnapped." Ryan said pushing himself off the locker turning his body towards you "I'm sorry, but I'll be fine, I promise." you reassured him so he brought his hand up to capture your cheek with a soft smile "I know you will be." he said before taking a brief look at your necklace 'Where ever you are, I will find you.' Ryan thought to himself. "So CSI Wolfe, please don't get yourself in trouble while I'm gone, okay." you said holding out a pinky towards him, making him chuckle but he joined his with yours none the less "I promise." with that he then pulled you into a tight hug "See you tomorrow and make sure to get lots of rest." he felt you nod against him "I will." he then pulled away looking down at you "I love you." you smiled up at him "And I love you." he gave you a quick kiss before releasing you from his hold and you both started to walk out the room together "Call me when you reach the office." you nodded "I will." you guys shared a smile and exchanged byes before going your separate ways.

            Ryan was given orders to go and talk to the paparazzi but on his way there something burst his tire, so stopping he got out to inspect what it was. Bending down to look at the tire someone came from behind knocking him out, making Ryan fall to the ground unconscious before he was taken.

            H and Eric were calling for Wolfe but weren't getting through, so Eric decided to call you instead "Hey Eric, what's up?" you answered "You're not back at the lab right?" Eric asked because you were working half and half that day, at the lab first then the office. "No, I'm not. Why, do you need something?" you asked him and Eric not bothering with concerning you about Ryan, dismissed it "Don't worry about it, I'll get Dave." "You sure?" "Positive." Eric said keeping his voice calm "Okay, just let me know if you need anything." "Will do." with that you both hung up not suspecting anything, especially the worse that your husband is missing.
