            "Hey babe." Ryan said coming in through the door "Hey!" you called out from the living room, so Ryan took off his shoes and rest down his bag before coming to you "Feels like old times huh." Ryan commented entering the living room, taking off his jacket, revealing the green button up underneath "Looks like someone really missed me today." you said gesturing to his choice of colour shirt and Ryan chuckled "After getting accustom to seeing you at work daily, of course I'll miss you." he said coming to sit beside you, head immediately going into your lap "Had a good day today?" you asked as your hands went to play with his hair causing Ryan to close his eyes in relaxation "It sucked." you chuckled "And why is that?" you asked looking down at him already knowing his answer "Because you weren't there." he turned facing your stomach snuggling further "My poor baby." Ryan sighed before turning to look up at you "And how was your day, at the office?" Ryan asked genuinely interested because it's been a while you had a full work day there "Was pretty good actually. Felt like old times, a part of me missed it, sitting behind a desk instead of standing in front of one." you chuckled but Ryan looked at you concerned "You don't like working at the lab?" "I do, I really do. If I didn't I wouldn’t have aimed for promotion. I love working at the lab, plus as a bonus my husband is there." you said truthfully smiling down at him. "Is the standing a problem for you?" you shook your head "Most times I don't even notice it cause I'm so busy, but I'm always constantly moving, but there is an upside to it, being on my feet all day." "And what is that?" you smiled down at him "At the end of the day I get my husband to massage my feet for me." that made Ryan smile "That I do love doing." you chuckled "Ready for dinner?" you asked and you felt him shake his head "Not yet, I just want to stay like this for a while." he said closing back his eyes getting comfortable again as your hands continued to play with his hair soothing him "Okay."

            You guys just finished eat and Ryan was telling you about today's case "Damn, the guts on you." you said because Ryan just told you he broke up two Russians fighting "It wasn't all of that." "Babe, that was illegal fighting, the kind that only ends in death, and you interfered, by grabbing the guy's hand. If that was me I would have been shitting bricks." you said making Ryan laugh "Well, the moment felt kind of bad ass." he said with a smirk "I bet it looked cool too, but still, too dangerous. I hope you guys didn't start anything with the Russians and got on their bad side." cause you've heard some bad things when it comes to these guys. "I'm sure we'll be fine, don't worry about it." "You know that's easier said than done babe." Ryan took your hand in his, giving it a reassuring squeeze "It will be okay, and if worse comes to worse, I'll keep you safe." when he said that you reached out your hand to capture his cheek "It’s you I'm worried about babe." you told him with a worried look "I'll make sure nothing happens to me. I promise." that reassured your heart but of course worry will still be there "Okay, or I will kill you myself." you said causing you both to share a laugh "Yes mam." he said firmly before sealing the deal with a kiss.
