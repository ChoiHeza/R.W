            Ryan was awake before you cause it was your off day and he told you that you could sleep in, don't worry about breakfast for him. So getting up Ryan kissed your forehead and headed for the bathroom to prepare for work. While he was in the bathroom that's when you woke up, but body feeling tired, you refused to move and just remained wrapped in the blankets for warmth and comfort, eyes remaining closed. Ryan entered back the bedroom and looked towards you and saw that you were still 'sleeping' so he went to the closet looking for something to wear, but little did he know that you were watching him with a smile on your face. Gosh was he beautiful, you thought to yourself. You saw him contemplate if to wear the tie or not so you decided to help out "Wear the tie, and ditch the jacket." you said making his head whip around to you "You're awake." you chuckled with a nod "The whole time. It's just something pleasing watching my husband go about his morning unaware that I'm awake." "Sounding like a creep babe." he said coming over to the bed with tie in hand "Says the man that does the same exact thing." you said coming out the blanket to kneel at the edge of the bed as Ryan approached you "Good morning beautiful." he said with a smile capturing your bare waist. You were currently only wearing a pair of knickers cause sometimes you hate sleeping with clothes on. "Good morning. Let me tie it." Ryan nodded and pulled back hands going to your hips to create distance so you can tie his tie. He watched you as you worked and was taking in all your beauty with a smile gracing his lips. When you were finished, you looked up and saw he was looking at you adoringly, so matching his smile you pecked his lips "All finished." you gave the tie a pat and he stepped away to look at it, and just as he was about to go to the mirror you grabbed his forearm "Wait." you pulled him back towards you lifting his hand "What are you doing?" he asked as he looked on "Rolling up your sleeves. It would look so much better." you said with a wink before looking back and getting started. "Go and look now." you said as Ryan moved away to the mirror and you got off the bed to join him "What do you think?" you asked standing partially behind him "I like it. It's a look." he chuckled "It is, a sexy, handsome look." you said with a wink to him in the mirror "So I see what you're doing. You're dressing me for your pleasures." he said turning to you and you shrugged "Nothing wrong with that." you said looking up at him, taking hold for his tie. "Well, I uh, don't mind. It's a win win situation for me." he said pulling you back against him once again before placing his lips on yours. After sharing a sweet kiss Ryan squeezed your bum before pulling away to finish get ready "What are you going to do today?" "Get some rest, cause I'm tired." you said stretching and caught Ryan checking you out "What?" he just shook his head before turning back to what he was doing "You're just beautiful." you giggled "And you're mighty handsome yourself." you said going to hug him from behind "And if I could, I would keep you home with me today." Ryan chuckled "You and me both."

            While home watching tv, you got a call that you were needed in the lab, for an urgent case, so you wasted no time in getting ready and heading off to work. You left without messaging or calling Ryan, it would be better to surprise him, so you made sure to wear a personal favourite work dress of Ryan's to just make his day. You got into the flow of work without any problems, like you have been here all morning. Getting info that was needed you pulled it up onto your tablet and went in search to share the info. But first deciding to pass by a lab you figured Ryan would be in, but to your luck he wasn't so you sighed, he's probably out in the field, but it's a long day, so there's more opportunities to see him. After you shared the information you were coming back when someone called out to you "Hey, excuse me." you turned around and saw it was gorgeous black woman that called you "Hey, can I help?" you offered her a smile "I'm new here and still trying to get a layout of the place." she said before reaching out her hand "I'm the new Medical Examiner, Tara Price." you took her hand shaking it very happy to meet her "Hey, I've heard of you, it's nice to finally meet you, Computer Tech, Heather Wolfe." her eyes widened "Wolfe, as in Ryan Wolfe, or just a coincidence?" you chuckled "I'm his wife." you said with a wide smile which she returned "That's pretty cool. Well if he gives me any trouble I know where to come." you laughed "Do not hesitate, cause he can be a handful at times." she laughed as well "I will remember that. Anyways I was looking for Lt. Caine?" "I just saw him down the hallway, he was talking to someone. He should still be there if you hurry." you said pointing the direction "Thank you so much." she said before leaving "Anytime." and you went the other direction.

            Coming back from the bathroom, the sight of someone caught your attention. It was Ryan and he was talking with Natalia. Approaching while he was backing you, you placed a finger to your lips signally to Natalia to don't say anything because she saw you coming. Keeping the smile from her face and looked back towards Ryan so you slowly walked up to them, placing your hand on Ryan's lower back, you felt him jump and you talked yourself into the conversation "Yeah, I heard that about him to." you said trying to keep a straight face and Natalia continued with a smile on her lips but Ryan was the one to stop it. "What is going on here? Why are you here?" he said looking towards as you stood properly with both of them "Got called out this morning and I wanted to surprise you." Ryan's eyes softened at that and you turned to Natalia "What was his reaction?" she chuckled "Startled." so you pumped your fist making her laugh "Yes! Well it was nice seeing you both, but I gotta get back to work." you said sending a wink Ryan's way before walking away "See you later." Natalia called after you. Ryan was still in a daze cause he wasn't expecting to see you here, and especially dressed the way you did, and just what you were hoping for, he watched you walk away until you were out of sight. He even leaned to the side of Natalia to get a better view of you and she just laughed watching Ryan's behaviour "The guys weren't kidding about you huh." Natalia said catching Ryan's attention "Huh?" he asked puzzled "You boldly checking Heather out." she stated and Ryan sighed "Leave me be. Let's get back to work." he said causing Natalia to laugh as they walked off together.

        <p class="story">
            "He can't help himself Heather. I'm telling you." Natalia told you and you chuckled "I've heard, and he says he controls it." she shook her head in disagreement "He doesn't, and the funny thing is, I don't think he knows he's doing it." "You think so?" you asked looking at her "If you really watch him, you would see it." you chuckled "Well, I can't. Only if I had eyes at the back of my head." "I just know you two are talking about me." Ryan said entering the locker room, so both you and Natalia shared a look before saying at the same time "No we weren't." Ryan believed not a word "Right…." he said opening his locker and both you and Natalia laughed before continuing talking.

            You guys had to stop by the convenience store for just a couple things, and one of them being ice cream, cause that delicacy is a must have in the Wolfe household. You were at the checkout first while Ryan went to get one more thing. Looking at the checkout guy you realized he wasn't the usual guy that works there so you greeted him with a good evening and smile, but he just scowled and you figured he was probably just having a bad day, so you pushed it aside "$26.50." he told you your total and you pulled out your card, handing it to him but he held up his hand "We take cash only." he said giving you a disgusted look "But I always pay by card here." you stated so he just rolled his eyes and mumbled under his breathe 'Damn blacks' he thought you didn’t hear but you did "Excuse me, say what you said just now, but to my face this time." you said sternly so giving you an annoyed look, he repeated his words "I said, 'Damn blacks'" you scoffed and was appalled "Have I done you something wrong?" you asked "I'm just tired of seeing your kind in our country." Ryan was making his way back and managed to hear that statement "My kind?" you said not realizing Ryan was back and before the guy spoke back Ryan did "Something wrong here?" Ryan asked looking between you two and the guy inspecting Ryan saw his gun and badge realized that Ryan is an officer "Yes officer, this lady right here is harassing me, and refusing to pay for the items." your eyes widened and you gasped, Ryan honestly couldn't believe what was happening before his eyes. Ryan saw that your eyes started to narrow so he took hold of you "No babe." then he looked towards the guy, getting annoyed himself "Is this how you treat your customers?" "I did nothing wrong sir, why are you accusing me?" the guy said acting innocent "You did nothing wrong? I just saw you harass my wife for being black, then lie to me about it." Ryan gave the guy a very hard look but he didn't back down "So you're sleeping with the enemy, typical." your blood boil and was ready to attack by Ryan held you back "Listen here, it's the 21st century, grow the f*** up." you said before storming out cause if you stayed you're going to make the situation so much worse for yourself, Ryan turned to the guy "What, going to arrest me?" "I could, for harassment and making false accusations to a police officer." Ryan tilted his head still mad, and the guy got mad now, coming from behind the counter to stand in front of Ryan "That's not the law, you're just saying that because you're married to that bitch." Ryan was furious now and was trying everything in his power to hold back and not punch the guy "Well, you know what, she's a way better person than you'll ever be." that statement caused the guy to snap and took a swig at Ryan, and that's all he needed to cuff the guy, "Now that's assault on a police officer." Ryan said pinning the guy against the counter before calling it in "This is not fair." "You should of thought of that before you attacked my wife.". While outside, you decided to go sit in the car and wait for Ryan as you cooled off. You trust him to handle the situation, but what you weren't expecting was to see a police car pulling up and two officers getting out before heading into the store. Getting out the vehicle you slowly walked back to the store and at the same time the officers were pulling the store clerk out, hands cuffed and him struggling against them, catching sight of you he spat towards you before saying "Stupid black bitch." you just shook your head and at that moment Ryan came out hearing his words and told the officer "Everything he says put on the record." "Yes, CSI Wolfe." they nodded hauling him off to the vehicle and Ryan came over to you "What happened in there?" you asked as he was in front you now "I wanted arrest to him but I needed a reason to, so I just agitated him till he snapped and arrested him for assault." Ryan said nonchalantly making you smile "How are you doing?" he asked taking your hands in his "I'm calm now. I'm zen." you chuckled and Ryan just gave you a sad smile, cause this was the first time he ever witnessed you experiencing racism and he's wondering how you're so calm about it, cause that really annoyed him and the thought just gets to him, and it's not him that the racism was targeted towards, but you, the love of his life. So he kept wondering how often did something like this happen for you to be calm about it, and how much have it happened that you never told him, cause you just mentioned that one time to him. Not wanting to bring it up for now he just said instead "Got to head to the station to handle some things then we could go home." you nodded.

        <p class="story">
            You guys were home now, everything put away and clothes discarded as you both sat in the tub, sitting across from each other. The whole evening, the event just kept playing over in Ryan's mind and he just kept looking at you to see if he could read your mind about the situation, but you caught on to the looks he were giving you so sighing, you caved and decided to ask "Speak your mind babe, what's wrong?" sighing himself he started "I don't get how you're calm about what happened." you gave a sad smile "I know it's not something you'll like to hear but, I guess a part of me is getting accustom to it." Ryan gave you a sad look "So it's happened since that time you last told me about?" Ryan asked and you nodded "Why didn't you tell me?" he looked sad "Because I didn't feel like thinking about it, and I don't think you would of understood." you said truthfully and Ryan looked disappointed "Before you say anything, have you ever experienced racism personally?" you asked looking into his eyes and he shook his head "That's what I figured." "But still, I could of done something about it." you fake laughed "Like what Ryan, what you did today? You were only able to arrest that guy because he touched you. You couldn't have arrested him because he made racist comments towards me." Ryan remained quiet and sighed because he knew you were right "Yes, it gets me mad and annoyed, but I try my best to calm down quickly after because of my skin colour. In a situation like that, I would be the one accused even though I did nothing wrong." Ryan just looked at you not knowing what to say because at the end of the day, he was a white male and never came close to experiencing any of the problems you've faced "So there's nothing I can do?" he asked and you chuckled "If you could change the law, that racist people could be arrested, that would be nice." Ryan smiled "You know if I had the power I would." you smiled widely at him "I know you would." you came closer to him "But thank you, for standing up for me today." then you looked at him and saw the bruise forming on his cheek "And thank you for taking a punch for me, just so you could arrest the guy." you said smiling before giving his bruise a kiss "I would take a beating for you anytime." Ryan said truthfully leaning into your hand "Well don't do it too often, cause I quit like your face." you said placing kisses over his face causing him to chuckle, pulling back you saw him smiling at you "I'm sorry you had witness that today." Ryan shook his head pulling you closer to him "Don't ever apologize for that, because something like this you shouldn't ever have to experience, and it hurts me to know that there isn't more I can do." your heart softened at that "You being with me is enough, and helping me fight my battles." "But still." you shushed him with a kiss "Shush, I love you, and I'm happy. Just let those people do what they do, and I keep living my life ignoring them." Ryan chuckled "Okay, once you're happy." he gave you a kiss himself. Turning around you laid against him and he wrapped his arms around you. Ryan placed a kiss against your shoulder with a an "And I love you." making you smile and feel contented with the life you have, yeah, you face mean people, but with Ryan it's all worth it.

            The next day Ryan went in for work, Eric took a look at Ryan and saw the bruise on his face "Whoa Wolfe, what happened?" he asked Ryan pointing to the bruise "Oh." Ryan sighed before continuing "Heather faced a racist encounter yesterday, and you know we can't arrest them for that." Delko nodded listening but could see where it was going "So let me guess, you agitated the guy so he threw a punch and arrest him for assault." Ryan nodded "How is she doing?" "It's wrong for me to say this, but I hate that she was calm about it afterwards." Delko understood "Was nothing new to her. I get that." Ryan looked towards Delko "You too?" he nodded "I guess it comes, with the skin colour." hearing that Ryan thought for a moment, and a reason came to mind as to why you and Delko were so close with each other, because you shared the same problems so Ryan decided to ask "Let me ask you this then, has she told you about the incidents when she faced racism?" "She has, and I'm sorry that I know them when you don't" Ryan dismissed him cause he understood why "It's okay, I'm not mad about it, cause she was right for her reasons, I never would truly understand what it's like. But I am thankful that she has someone she can talk to about them." Ryan said offering Delko a smile "Always, we look out for each other." Delko reassured Ryan, and Ryan's heart calmed at that because he trusts Delko with you, and knows he'll keep you safe. So the fact that you have him to turn to for that, someone that understands, he's very grateful and would always understand why if you decide not to tell him. Turning to Ryan, Delko hesitated before asking "I should of asked you, how did you feel when it happened?" Ryan paused and thought for a moment before replying "I felt awful, and I wasn't even the victim in the situation and it hurt to watch knowing that this is something my wife faces, based on the colour of her skin, and it's not something I can control. I felt helpless almost. I think I'm doing worse than her at this moment." Ryan chuckled at the end turning to Delko "She is your wife, the love of your life, and I know you love her with everything that you have. Because of that, witnessing the one you love being treated that way, would do that to you, plus it was your first time." "That's the part that hurts, it's my first time but not hers. She's been through this other times before, that I'm not aware of. So imagine my mental state after one encounter and not the target to hers that's more than once and being the target." Ryan said with a heavy heart, Delko saw he was hurting "I'm sorry man. But know this, Heather is okay, and she moves past it." Eric tried to comfort Ryan but just that moment you entered the locker room, with a wide smile, halting the conversation between the two "Now I catch you with him." you said laughing heading over to Ryan but suddenly realized the weight in the room "Everything okay?" you asked looking between the two of them and Ryan chuckled "Yeah, of course. Just talking about work." after Ryan said that you looked towards Eric with a raised brow "Yeah, just work." you nodded not fully believing but don't want to push "Okay. Well I came looking for you guys. H wants you Eric and Calleigh was looking for you Ryan." you said pointing at each individual "Thanks Heather." Eric said before leaving and he and Ryan shared a nod. After he left you went to stand in front Ryan "Everything okay baby?" you asked with worry in your voice but Ryan nodded "It is, now that I get to see your gorgeous face." that made you chuckle "Even at work you must flirt with me." "Of course, what kind of husband would that make me and you what else I like to do at work?" "What?" you asked and Ryan looked around before leaning in "Kiss you." he whispered against your lips before connecting the two in a quick love filled kiss, pulling away you couldn't help but smile "I've always wanted to do that." Ryan said, his heart feeling better after his talk with Delko and also seeing you smiling not bothered by the events of yesterday. You truly do know how to brighten his day. "As nice as that was, we're still at work, and Calleigh still needs to see you." you scolded making Ryan smile wide "Yes mam." with that you both left the locker room, but not before sharing one more quick kiss.
