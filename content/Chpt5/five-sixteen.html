            "You sure you're going to be okay today by yourself?" Ryan asked as you both stood by the door so you pulled the blanket closer around yourself "Yes. It's just the cold Ryan. I'll take some medicine and sleep majority of the day anyway." you reassured him but Ryan still gave you a worried look so you rolled your eyes "I'll be fine. Now leave or you'll be late." Ryan sighed before nodding "Okay, but don't hesitate to call me if you need something." Ryan said sternly so you replied with a nod "Yes sir." he sent a smile your way before kissing your forehead "I'll see you when I come in later. I love you." you smiled up at him "And I love you. Be safe today." "Always." after telling each other 'bye' Ryan was gone.

            As promised you spent majority of the day sleeping because of the medicine you were using, and that's how Ryan came home and found you. Entering the bedroom he saw wrapped up in your blankets, knocked out sleeping, unaware of the world going on around you. So when moving around the room, he made sure to move quietly not wanting to disturb you, so he came over to check if you had a fever and he only felt slight warmth. Deciding to order some soup for you to use for when you wake up so you won't have to worry about preparing something to eat. After Ryan placed the order he decided to take a shower. Exiting the bathroom he heard your phone ping so checking it, he saw it was a message from Delko 'Good news Heather, I got citizen ship and Calleigh. I know you're sick so you can message or call when you're available. I just wanted to let you know, also get better soon, I'm missing my wing woman.' as Ryan read the message the part that stuck with him was the 'Calleigh' part, so he raised a brow wondering what that's about. 'Maybe I should ask her?' Ryan thought but decided in the end it would be best not to pry and when ready you both would share. Just that moment while Ryan was in his head he saw your body stir. Sitting on the bed next to you, Ryan looked at you "Hey." you manage to say softly "Hi babe, how are you feeling?" he asked looking down at you "Still like shit." you said making Ryan chuckle "Well, I ordered some soup for you and it should get here soon. Would you like to take a warm bath in the meanwhile, it would make you feel better?" Ryan suggested and you nodded "That sounds perfect." so Ryan leaned forward kissing your forehead before getting up "I'll get the water ready." with that Ryan left returning to the bathroom and you closed back your eyes.

            You had your bath, your soup and your next dose of medicine and you were back in bed feeling a bit better but ready for another sleep session. That evening into the night Ryan took very good care of you and helped you fight your cold. By time morning came around you were feeling so much better thanks to your wonderful husband.
