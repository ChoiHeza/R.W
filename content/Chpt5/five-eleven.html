            "The white tie looks kind of weird doesn't it?" Ryan asked turning to face you as you sat on the bed putting on your heels "It does, wear the purple one." you told him looking back down to your shoes. He switched it out and asked once again how he look "Perfect!" you told him with a smile "Now help me." you chuckled "Tell me, why do I always lose these bets." you said referring to your nails making Ryan laugh. You lost a bet with your friends and had to get your nails done "Well, I think they look nice." Ryan said as he knelt before you to help you buckle your strap "They do, but I feel so stupid with them, like I can't help myself." you said then gestured to your shoes "Like putting on my own shoes for example." Ryan chuckled "How long do you have to wear them for?" Ryan asked and you sighed "A week." you said looking down at him with sad eyes and Ryan just smiled up at you "That'll be over before you know it. All finished." you said resting back down your foot "Thank you love." you said capturing his face pecking his lips. "You are very welcome." he said before getting up and pulling you along with him "No matter how high your heels are, you'll never reach me." Ryan chuckled looking down at you, he wants to be a tease, you can play at his game as well "The same thing for you with Eric." you said with a wink walking away from him, he was stunned at your reply "Well played babe, well played." Ryan said making you chuckle "Thank you." you said going over to the dresser.

            You received a call that you were needed at the office, so you felt your lab in search for Ryan, you called him and he said he was in Valera's lab. Knocking at the entrance you alerted both their attentions, you greeted Valera before capturing Ryan's arm "Can I borrow CSI Wolfe for a moment?" you asked her and she chuckled "He's all yours." "Thank you." you said pulling Ryan out the lab "Something wrong?" Ryan asked looking at you with worry but you shook your head "Everything is fine. I just got a call that I'm needed at the office." "Need the car?" you nodded "Do you know how long you'll be gone?" "I'm not sure, but if it's for the rest of the day, I'll just pick you up from work." you told him as he fished out the keys "Okay, just call and keep me updated." he said handing you the keys "Will do." you said starting to walk away "Need me to walk you down?" Ryan asked hopeful and you chuckled turning back to him "Or do you need to walk me down?" you asked with a raised brow hiding your smile and Ryan realized you caught on "You caught me, so yes or no?" you chuckled "Weren't you working on something in there?" you asked pointing towards Valera "I got what I needed, I was just waiting till you came." you chuckled "Okay then, you may accompany me." Ryan smiled wide at hearing your reply then he joined you as you both headed down to the locker room.

            You ended up working at the office for the rest of the day, so you had to pick up Ryan from the station. While pulling over to the side of the road you saw Ryan making his way towards you. After the car stopped, you got out heading over to the passenger side "I have arrived on time as promised." you smiled towards him as he approached you "You didn't had to rush out right?" he asked standing in front you now and you shook your head "I was finished, just waited for your call." you opened the passenger door "You're driving." you stated before getting in and Ryan chuckled before getting in the driver side.

            You and Ryan were currently in the bedroom putting away the laundry, Ryan folded while you put them away to their respective places. The tv was on in the background as you both watched but it's been a while now that Ryan's mind wasn't on the tv but thinking about something. "Do you have the other sock to match this one?" you asked Ryan going through the drawer but you got no reply so you looked towards him "Ryan?" you called when you realized his mind was miles away. Still nothing, so you stopped what you were doing and turned fully towards him "Ryan." you called again and this time, it alerted his attention. "You were miles away babe, what's going on?" you asked as you approached him. Ryan pulled himself up before wrapping his arms around your waist looking down at you "I know it's been a while but I talked to Eric about what happened at the convenience store, and it still bothers me." Ryan said with a pained expression "It shouldn't babe, cause that's what they want, for us to be affected by it." you said taking hold of his cheek "So, if I'm not bothered by it, you shouldn't be." Ryan shook his head "I disagree because it wasn't right. I wasn't even the target and I wasn't doing well mentally after that so I couldnâ€™t even imagine the state you must have been in." Ryan said truthfully, bringing a hand up to grasp your cheek, so you leaned into it, knowing that Ryan cares dearly for you "Ryan, I'm okay. Really. I guess it's just because it's not something new to me and this was the first time you've witnessed it happening to me." Ryan closed his eyes at that because you're right, and that's the part that hurts him "That's the part that hurts me, the fact that you faced this and I knew nothing about it." he said opening his eyes looking down at you before continuing "And I'm not mad and I understood why you did it but it just hurts that I can't stop it from happening to you." Ryan said releasing your face now, so you pulled him into a tight embrace and Ryan chuckled "You're comforting me, when it should be the other way around." you released a small laugh at that "We're comforting each other." you said and Ryan held you tighter for a few more moments before pulling away but still keeping you close against him, then he brought both his hands up this time to capture your face and he gave you such a love filled look "How could someone not like your skin? It's personally one of my favourite things about you, so gorgeous." Ryan said truthfully before placing kisses over your face leaving compliments behind making you giggle "Sadly I don't taste like chocolate." you said making Ryan chuckle "Actually, you taste sweeter than chocolate." Ryan said now placing kisses in your neck, tickling you in the process, making you laugh. "I am truly in love with your skin." Ryan said kissing down your arm now, till he reached your finger tips and his words and actions made your heart swell and you instantly felt bad about keeping the incidents from him "I'm sorry." you said making Ryan look back you "What for?" "For not telling you about the times it happened." you said with sorrow in your eyes and Ryan wrapped back his arms around your waist "Don't be sorry and that's okay, but it would be nice to be included but that's only if you want me to." Ryan said making you smile up at him, so you placed a peck on his lips before replying "If it happens again, I will tell you going forward." "But let's hope it doesn't happen again." Ryan said and you chuckled "I agree, but we have to be real with ourselves." you said with a raised brow and Ryan sighed knowing you're correct "I'm sorry." he said and you shook your head "Don't be." you said smiling up at him before tiptoeing and connecting your lips with his. "So, shall we return back to these clothes, they're not going to fold and put away themselves." you said with a grin and Ryan nodded with a chuckle "Yes mam." he said pecking your lips one last time before you both broke apart and went back to the clothes. Then you remembered the question you asked him earlier "Do you have a match to this sock?" you asked smiling towards Ryan, holding up the sock before him and this time, he heard you.
