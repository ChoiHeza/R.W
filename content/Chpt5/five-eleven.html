            "The white tie looks kind of weird doesn't it?" Ryan asked turning to face you as you sat on the bed putting on your heels "It does, wear the purple one." you told him looking back down to your shoes. He switched it out and asked once again how he look "Perfect!" you told him with a smile "Now help me." you chuckled "Tell me, why do I always lose these bets." you said referring to your nails making Ryan laugh. You lost a bet with your friends and had to get your nails done "Well, I think they look nice." Ryan said as he knelt before you to help you buckle your strap "They do, but I feel so stupid with them, like I can't help myself." you said then gestured to your shoes "Like putting on my shoes for example." Ryan chuckled "How long do you have to wear them for?" Ryan asked and you sighed "A week." you said looking down at him with sad eyes and Ryan just smiled up at you "That'll be over before you know it. All finished." you said resting back down your foot "Thank you love." you said capturing his face pecking his lips. "You are very welcome." he said before getting up and pulling you along with him "No matter how high your heels are, you'll never reach me." Ryan chuckled looking down at you, he wants to be a tease, you can play at his game as well "The same thing for you with Eric." you said with a wink walking away from him, he was stunned at your reply "Well played babe, well played." Ryan said making you chuckle "Thank you." you said going over to the dresser.

            You received a call that you were needed at the office, so you felt your lab in search for Ryan, you called him and he said was in Valera's labs. Knocking at the entrance you alerted both their attentions you greeted Valera before capturing Ryan's arm "Can I borrow CSI Wolfe for a moment?" you asked her and she chuckled "He's all yours." "Thank you." you said pulling Ryan out the lab "Something wrong?" Ryan asked looking at you with worry but you shook your head "Everything is fine. I just got a call that I'm needed at the office." "Need the car?" you nodded "Do you know how long you'll be gone?" "I'm not sure, but if it's for the rest of the day, I'll just pick you up from work." you told him as he fished out the keys "Okay, just call and keep me updated." he said handing you the keys "Will do." you said starting to walk away "Need me to walk you down?" Ryan asked hopeful and you chuckled turning back to him "Or do you need to walk me down?" you asked with a raised brow hiding your smile and Ryan realized you caught on "You caught me, so yes or no?" you chuckled "Weren't you working on something in there?" you asked pointing towards Valera "I got what I needed, I was just waiting till you came." you chuckled "Okay then, you may accompany me." Ryan smiled wide at hearing your reply then he joined you as you both headed down to the locker room.

            You ended up working at the office for the rest of the day, so you had to pick up Ryan from the station. While pulling over to the side of the road you saw Ryan making his way towards you. After the car stopped, you got out heading over to the passenger side "I have arrived on time as promised." you smiled towards him as he approached you "You didn't had to rush out right?" he asked standing in front you now and you shook your head "I was finished, just waited for your call." you opened the passenger door "You're driving." you stated before getting in and Ryan chuckled before getting in the driver side.
