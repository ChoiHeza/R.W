            Both you and Ryan just arrived at work and were in the locker room "Can't I come to girls night?" Ryan asked as he leaned against his locker watching you "Of course not Ryan. The answer will always be no, you know this." you said chuckling looking towards him "I know but I always take a shot." Ryan said with a shrugged then his phone beeped "This is work, I gotta head to the morgue, so I will see you later." Ryan said pushing himself of the locker heading towards you "Okay, later." you said as he kissed your temple before leaving.

            While Ryan was in the morgue asking Tara about the victims from the restaurant that got blown up, Kyle was helping her remove a body from its bag, then they all heard something feel. Ryan looked down in time to see it was grenade so quickly pulling Kyle and Tara to cover behind a steel table the grenade went off destroying what was in its path. After it calm down Ryan asked if everyone was okay and Kyle was freaking out so Ryan took Kyle by the face and calmed him down letting him know it's not his fault and after that he called for Tara to see if she was okay. "Tara! Are you okay?" he wasn't getting a reply so he looked up and saw she was hunched over doing something, so he slowly approached her asking again "Are you okay?". When he got closer he saw that she was sweeping up pills putting them in a bottle and he found the action very weird and asked her about it and she just brushed it off saying it was evidence. He watched her until she went to get up, then pulled her aside to talk to her. Ryan mentioned to her what he saw and she said she was just collecting evidence but Ryan knew better than that so he warned her and told you to get help and stop whatever it is she's doing cause the next time he sees something, he won't be able to close his eyes to it. But once again kept denying and said she's fine before walking away and as Ryan watched her leave he kept thinking that he's seeing the signs for when he was addicted to gambling and being in denial about it and lying, so he saw himself. It kept bothering him so he decided to go talk to you.

            You were in the lab with Dave as you guys were going to through some footage when you both heard a tap at the door so you both looked back "Hey guys." Ryan greeted then looked towards you "Heather, can I borrow you for a minute?" Ryan asked and you nodded so you looked towards Dave and he said it's okay, so you left his side walking out to meet Ryan. "What's up?" you asked and you stood in front Ryan now and his arms were folded "There's something I want to talk to you about." he said before looking around and explaining what happened "Are you okay?" you asked him concerned "I am but that's not what I'm here for." he said so you tilted your head to the side and listened on as he explained the situation with Tara "Okay, maybe she's telling the truth." you suggested and Ryan shook his head "I knew she was lying because the way she acted was the same way I acted when asked about gambling." so you gave him a look "Are you positive, cause this is a big accusation?" and Ryan nodded "I'm sure, the signs are there." you released a deep sigh "So what are you going to do about it?" you asked him cause you know Ryan isn't going to easily let this go "I just warned her because she deserves a chance but I told her the next time I can't let it slide." you nodded "That's fair. I hope she heeds the warning cause this serious." "You and me both." Ryan said offering a sad smile and just as you were about to say something you heard Dave calling your name "Heather!" he said with a 'come here' gesture of his hand so you nodded before turning back to Ryan "I gotta go, be careful okay." you said offering him a smile and a touch on his arm "Always." Ryan said with a smile of his own and a wink before walking away and you entered back the lab.

            It was the end of your shift and you, Calleigh and Natalia were in the locker room getting ready to head out. "We should go back to that bar we went to last time." Natalia suggested and both you and Calleigh agreed "I think the bartender there serves us really well." Calleigh said making both you and Natalia laugh "That's only because he thinks we're really pretty and has a chance." you said making Natalia agree with you and at that exact moment Eric and Ryan entered the locker room "Who thinks you're pretty and has a chance?" Ryan asked causing Eric to laugh "This bartender from the last bar we went to." You answered and Ryan gave a raised brow "So I take it you guys are going somewhere different this time?" when Ryan asked that you girls shared a look before shaking your heads unanimously "Why would we when he serves us really well." Calleigh said with a shrug and that made Ryan look towards Eric "See, this is why sometimes I don't get woman." Ryan said pointing at you guys before turning to his locker "You and me both Wolfe." Eric commented.

            Ryan was on the sofa watching tv when he heard his phone rang, so leaning forward he retrieved it from the coffee table and saw you name flashing across the screen so he chuckled before answering "Hey babe." he said into the receiver and waited for your reply "Hello hello hello." you said singing into the phone, the first thought that entered Ryan's mind was that you're drunk "Is something wrong Heather?" Ryan asked and he heard whispering in the background "Tell him." it was Natalia's voice that said "What if it goes wrong?" Ryan heard to asked her back "Just do it, I bet he feels the same way." came Calleigh's voice this time "Tell me what love?" Ryan asked, alerting you that he's still there and was listening, so you sighed before speaking "Ryan, I just wanted to tell you, that I think you're cute, and that I like you." you said and Ryan could tell you're being serious and he could hear the nervousness in your voice. He was not expecting you to say that but it caused him to laugh "See, I told you guys he doesn't like me back, he's laughing at me" you said voice laced with disappointment and sadness and just as Ryan was about to reply he heard you hang up on him. He pulled the phone away and looked at it puzzled before calling you back, but it kept going straight to voicemail. Ryan chuckled to himself "She is clearly very drunk." he said while getting up to change his clothes and headed to the door retrieving his keys before leaving.

            When Ryan got there, you three outside sitting, so Ryan made the others got ways to get home safely before turning to you. He stooped down in front of you taking your hands in his "Ready to go home?" Ryan asked and you frowned "I thought you didn't liked me?" you sulked and it made Ryan smile at just how cute you were being "I do like you, love you even." Ryan said and that made your eyes lit up "Really?! So that means you think I'm pretty?" you asked hopeful and Ryan nodded "You're gorgeous." that made you smile widely making Ryan chuckle "He thinks I'm gorgeous." you said to yourself smile not leaving your face so Ryan just shook his head at you "I think you're gorgeous too." you said beaming down at him "I know you do." Ryan smiled up at you and your eyes widened "How do you know that, can you read minds?" you asked truly curious and Ryan shook his head "I can't but I only know that because you tell me all the time." you were amazed now "I do. Wow." then a thought crossed Ryan's mind, 'I think she forgot we're married.' so he raised his hand and showed you his wedding band and the moment you saw it you face faltered "You're married?" you said truly heartbroken and Ryan just couldn't stop himself from smiling at you "Yes I am." he said then went for your hand to raise it to show you your wedding rings "To you." the moment he said that your eyes opened in disbelief "No way I'm married to Ryan Wolfe." you said not believing it while inspecting the rings on your finger "You are Mrs. Wolfe." the moment he said that you looked towards him with lit up eyes "What did you call me?" "Mrs. Wolfe." the moment the words left Ryan's lips again a grin took shape on your face "I'm Mrs. Wolfe." you said all giggly while looking at the rings while being on cloud nine. Ryan just couldn't stop shaking his head at how cute you were being. "Ready to go home now?" Ryan asked again and you looked towards him grinning widely while nodding. Just as you were about to get up Ryan turned and placed you on his back before standing up "I can walk perfectly fine you know." you protested "I sure bet you can." Ryan said making you sigh in defeat before laying your head on his back "So strong." you commented as Ryan chuckled making his way to the car. "Let's get you home and sober." Ryan said but mostly to himself because you were busy feeling how strong his back is.
