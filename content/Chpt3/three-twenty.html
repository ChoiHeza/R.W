            "What do you think?" Ryan asked you as he stood in front the mirror after putting together his work outfit for the day "I love it, but I think it needs something different." "Like what?" he asked turning to you, so you got up from your position on bed and knelt down beside it, pulling out a box from under and Ryan watched you "What's that?" you stood now fully with the fancy box in hand "When I went shopping the other day with Monica I saw this and immediately thought of you." he approached you and you gave him the box. He took it and removed the lid but there was paper wrapped covering the contents so you took the lid from him so he could unwrap the paper. When he saw what it contain a huge smile made way to his face "Wow, these are for me?" you nodded, within the box were a pair of brown dress boots and a belt to match "Try them on." you held the box while he took out the shoes going over to the bed to sit to put them on. Once they were on he stood feeling out the shoes "They fit perfectly and are completely comfortable, plus I love the colour" you had a smile of your own on your face now "Now try the belt with it." you said with belt in hand outstretched towards him. He took off the current belt he was wearing before taking the new one from your hand replacing it. Once the fit was complete he went back to the mirror "Now that's what I was missing. Thank you babe, they’re perfect." he said while inspecting his look then it flashed across his mind why he loved the colour so much "Wait, this is your skin tone?" he asking turning towards you and your smile grew cause he noticed "Yeah, I was hoping you would of noticed. They were in different shades so I said why not a shade that's my skin tone, that way while you wear them, it's like I'm with you." you told him and he turned back to the mirror looking at them and after finding the meaning behind it, he loved the gift even more "I love them, thank you." he was in front you now with your face in his hands placing the sweetest kiss he could muster on your lips "Well, I'm thankful you do. Now you're ready for work." you stood back to admire "And I must add, you look very handsome, like I want to eat you handsome." you said with a chuckle causing Ryan to as well "Well, I wish there was time for you to devour me, but I have to get going." his hands were on your hips now "But keep that energy for when I return this evening." you nodded "Yes sir, I'll be waiting." you said smoothing down the hair at the back of his head "You drive me crazy you know that." he said hovering his lips over yours "You have to get going CSI Wolfe, or you will be late." closing his eyes with a smile Ryan sighed "Fine, but this evening you're mine, okay." and you nodded "All yours." you tip toed to give him one last kiss before he left you knowing that if he stayed longer he'll have to call in sick.

            When Ryan entered the morgue to ask Alexx a question about the victim, she was caught off guard by how he looked "Who are you and what have you done with Ryan?" she commented with a smile admiring Ryan "What do you mean?" she gestured to how he was dressed "You very look handsome, and I will make this comment, you're matching your shoes with your belt, not a lot of guys do that, and the shade of brown is really nice." the compliment brought a smile to Ryan's face "Well thank you Alexx but can't take all the credit, this was Heather's doing." Alexx raised a brow looking impressed "She bought me the shoes and belt and a little known fact it's her skin tone." Ryan had a proud smile on his face while saying that "That's really sweet. You guys are really adorable." after a little more chit chat they returned back to work. While you were home, some stuff you ordered were delivered, so signing off for the packages, you wasted no time in unboxing them. Because one of the boxes contained two pieces of clothing that you were just excited to try on, not because they were elegant but you know Ryan would love them. When you found the box you wanted you wasted no time in going to the bedroom to try them on. Putting on a little fashion show for yourself.

            After Ryan's shift was over he wasted no time getting home because you had messaged and said you have a surprise for him, and that made Ryan super excited. So coming in through the door he called out for you "Beautiful, I'm home." he said while resting down his bag and taking off his shoes "Hey, wait in the living room, there's something I want to show you." he heard you called back and did as told. He shed his jacket before taking a seat on the sofa "Ready?" Ryan heard you asked "Yeah, sure." it wasn't long before Ryan saw you round the corner, and his jaw dropped, literally. "What do you think?" you were there standing in a very elegant silk emerald green robe, that was styled with fluff at the hems, and what brought it all together was how you had your hair styled. You had it out in a natural afro, and it's on very rare occasions that Ryan gets to see the style but when he does, he just gets stunned and amazed by your beauty. He was quiet for a moment just drinking in your whole body frozen, for a moment you thought you broken him "Babe, still with me?" the sound of your voice brought him from whatever trance he was in cause the first words to leave his lips were "Wow, just wow." his hand was covering his mouth now, as he leaned over not believing how gorgeous you looked right now. He wondered if he died and went to heaven. You decided to take his limited words as a compliment "So I take it as a yes, that I look good?" "Good does not describe how you look right now, I don't think the word exists, because just you're gorgeous but that word doesn’t do you justice right now. Maybe the word ethereal but like way higher." you felt your face heated up at the compliment "Thank you baby, I know you would of like it." Ryan's heart swelled "All of this was for me?" you nodded "All for you." and Ryan wondered how did he get so lucky. He was just about to get up to come towards you but you halted him "Stop, I have a another one to show you." "There's more? Oh be still my sweet beating heart." that made you chuckle "Don't move, be right back." "Wouldn't think of it." with that you quickly disappeared and changed into the white version of the green one. So you rounded back the corner ready for Ryan's reaction and it was more impressive than the pervious "I took a page from the book of the people of Miami, and got something white, since you guys love this colour so much." "Are you real baby?" you giggled coming towards Ryan "Very real baby. Touch." you said as you stood in front of him, and he brought his hands to run along your thighs "I feel like God is rewarding me for something that I've done and I would love to know what it is so that I can keep doing it." "Maybe it's being a good husband that deserves love as well." you said as he brought his hands up higher now inspecting the robe himself and the way it looks on you. "Then that's something I'll never stop being." he hooked his arms behind your knees to bring you to straddle his lap. "So you love the robes?" you asked as Ryan looked over every inch of your body, he slowly nodded "They’re gorgeous, you're gorgeous, I honestly can't get enough." you internally rewarded yourself 'job well done Heather' "And the hair, it makes the look way more sexy and elegant." he was admiring your facial features now "That's what I was aiming for." "I love it." his hands were running from your thighs now to your bum then stopped at your hips "Well I love how you look as well. I couldn't stop thinking about it from this morning." you said running your hands along his body, boy were you driving him crazy, the actions encouraged him to pull your hips closers towards him "Well from since this morning I couldn’t wait to come back home to you but I never expected to come home to this." your head moved to leave a trail of kisses along his jawline and neck, then you kissed up to his ear before whispering "It's all for you baby." you heard him released a moan, and that was all it took for Ryan to take hold of the situation. Grabbing tightly onto your hips he stood and you quickly wrapped your legs around his waist while he headed off to the bedroom, cause according to the Ryan 'With the size of the bed so much more can be done.'.

            You were both exhausted lying next to each other, you on your stomach and Ryan on his side, while running his hand up and down your exposed back. Your eyes were closed and Ryan was just admiring your beauty cause he could never get enough of it "Why don't you wear your hair like this more often?" Ryan's question cause you to open your eyes to meet his "Because it damages my hair but also the rarer I do it the more special it becomes because I love leaving you speechless." you said giggling and Ryan rolled his eyes "Well, I'm sorry that you're gorgeous." he said chuckling before saying something else "What other colours did those robes come in?" Ryan asked trying not to seem like he was interested so that made you chuckle "Every colour of the rainbow. I was also going to order a black one, but they were sold out, cause I just know that black would have looked the best." Ryan closed his eyes picturing it and boy did he regret it being sold out, seeing the pain in his face you reassured him "Don't worry, the moment they're back in stock I'll get one, and you'll have the white and black ones all for yourself." he looked confused "What about the green one?" you smiled "That's for me. For when you're not home, like during the day or when you have a double shift. I can wear it and feel powerful and elegant. It's green for a reason." now Ryan was curious "I am curious to what you do when I'm not here." you shrugged "Nothing much, just treat myself, do selfcare, girly stuff." he found that interesting cause he never knew what you did "I see. It sounds relaxing, well I'm glad you get to take care of yourself." you nodded "It is very much needed because you are stress." you joked and Ryan scoffed "I'm an angel." "Right babe, and I'm the devil." you said getting up "Well, I wouldn't dismiss that based on what just happened." it was your turn to scoff and you smacked his chest "Because of that you earned yourself a shower by yourself." you said standing from the bed "Come on babe, it was a joke, well not really." Ryan said laughing and you just shook your head smiling heading off to the bedroom "You coming or not?" you asked pausing by the door turning back to look at Ryan "Of course." he quickly closed the distance between you two and once again you were back in his arms before entering the bathroom. "Obsessed you are." and Ryan grin widely at you "That I will never deny." he said before crashing his lips on yours.
