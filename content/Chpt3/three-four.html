            When the second body of a modal came in, Ryan was in charge of taking pictures of the body with an inferred camera to determine if the victim was pushed. Alexx was with Ryan as he took the photos "It looks like he was definitely pushed, they are hand prints on his chest." "Poor baby." Alexx commented "Let's check out the rest of him" Ryan suggested and Alexx lifted the sheet off his lower half so he could take more pictures but while looking through the lens he saw something interesting. What he saw caused him to chuckle "What is it?" Alexx asked "Looks like Cody had some fun before he died." "What do you mean?" "Little Cody has lipstick rings on him." Alexx gasped in shock "That may help with who pushed him. I'll get a sample and send it off." "Thanks Alexx." Ryan said leaving with a chuckle because he was very familiar.

            Delko received the samples from Alexx and was running test for DNA and the brand of lipstick. Ryan entered the lab just as the tests were completed "Hey, is that the lipstick results?" Ryan asked Delko as he was holding the paper that just printed the results "Yeah, the brand is called The Ring." Ryan chuckled at that as Delko handed him a copy of the result "It was smartly designed to leave rings behind on skin, for example, like the victim these samples came from and it only comes in different shades of red or pink." Ryan said looking over the paper in his hands and Delko was watching him carefully "How do you know that, the results doesn't say?" Ryan quickly looked up at Delko who was giving him a smirk, "Uh, what I meant was. I just heard about it somewhere." Ryan said stumbling over his words, Delko wasn't buying a thing Ryan was saying "Uh huh, right. So you know nothing about it?" Delko asked and Ryan shook his head "Nope, why would I. So did you find out who wore it?" Ryan asked trying to change the topic but Delko wasn't going to let it go that easy but he had his ways of finding out "No, not as yet, got to run more tests." Ryan was going over the report as Delko talked "What about who pushed him?" Delko asked "There's nothing there as yet, but we're working on it." Delko had Ryan where he wanted him, distracted "So how many shades of the lipstick does Heather own?" Delko asked smugly looking up at Ryan "About five or six." Ryan replied not realizing till he caught on that Delko was quiet looking at him with a smirk and Ryan realized what just happened "I got you." Delko said starting to laugh and Ryan couldn't help but chuckle "I see what you did there, that was clever." "So you can't hide anymore, that's how you know about it?" Ryan sighed "Fine, yes I know about it because Heather wears it." Delko couldn't keep in his laugh "So, I take it you're a fan of the lipstick?" Ryan just shook his head starting to leave "No comment Delko." but Delko shouted after him "Come on, give me something." Ryan paused and smiled before turning back quick to reply "It's easy to clean off with soap and twelve out ten would recommend." Delko whistled as Ryan left the lab shaking his head at Delko's antics.

            Ryan's shift was over so he wasted no time in making his way home but first stopping for takeout and flowers. Entering the apartment, Ryan was met with dead silence, he figured you weren't home as yet but when he took off his shoes he saw yours were there, "Babe, I'm home." he called out but the silence remained so heading to the kitchen, he rest down the take out and flowers he brought home for you along with his bag and went to search for you. Entering the bedroom he saw you were stretched out across the bed deep in sleep with the tv playing Friends in the background and your laptop opened beside you, so he assumed you were doing some work but got tired. Not wanting to wake you, Ryan slowly backed out the room and returned to the kitchen putting the take out in the microwave and the flowers in a vase of water. When finished there Ryan went into the living room to watch some tv and relax himself after having a long day. Thirty minutes passed before Ryan heard movement coming from the bedroom and it wasn't long before you emerged with a sleepy face and yawning. "Look who's awake." Ryan said with a smile barely moving from his leaned back, legs spread position "Hey, got home ever since?" you asked making your way to the sofa after a big stretch "A good while now, just didn't want to disturb you." Ryan had his arm out stretched towards your direction which you took and placed yourself on top of him, legs going both sides of his body and head snuggling into his neck. Ryan brought both his arms to wrap around your body pulling you closer to him, it made you hum at the nice feeling "You're so warm." you said snuggling deeper into him "And your body is feeling a little chilly, is everything okay?" he felt you nod "Probably just the AC then." he said turning back to the tv. A few moments passed before Ryan spoke "Had a good day today?" he got no reply and checking he realized your breathing was even, letting him know that you fell back to sleep. He smiled to himself at the thought, because of everything that happened recently it felt nice, that you trusted him enough again to fall asleep on him, so he kept you close and allowed you to sleep for how long you needed to.

            Hunger is what woke you from your sleep. You released a groan because you were so comfortable and didn't want to move, that made Ryan chuckle "Hungry?" you nodded "But I donâ€™t feel like moving." you released a sigh "You don't have to, I brought home take out, I'll just have to heat it up." a smile graced your face and not moving from Ryan's neck to place kisses there "Thank you babe, you're a doll." Ryan pulled you into a sitting up position making you take a proper look at him since he came home "Hey beautiful." Ryan greeted with a smile that caused you to giggle "Hello handsome." he brought his hand up to cup your check before pulling your face towards his to give you a loving kiss "I'll go get dinner ready." you nodded and Ryan give you one more peck before you moved off of him so he could get up and head to the kitchen.

            "You would not believe what she told me." you both were in kitchen eating the take out that Ryan brought home "What, that you would make a good modal?" Ryan shook his head "That my look is so last season." that made you fake gasped "How dare she question my husband's outfit." you tsked "I think you look rather dashing, cute and comfortable, especially when you wear sweaters. I love the look." you told him truthfully "I was so tempted to tell her I dress for my wife but then I got a feeling that she would insult you too." you both laughed at that "But they both ended up in jail right, for killing off their modals for the insurance money." "They would of but they killed each other." you gave a puzzled look "How?" "The blonde killed the brunette with a gunshot and the brunette killed the blonde by lacing her lip gloss with poison." "Wow, talk about back stabbing, I guess they both got their own revenge. Low key it's a little funny when you think about it." and Ryan gave you a puzzled look "Just think about it, it is a bit comical. They both back stabbed each other in the end. They were supposed to be best friends that started this business together but clearly turned out to hate each other." "I guess I can see it." you both chuckled at the situation before continuing to eat.

            You just finish showered and was brushing your teeth while Ryan was in the shower "Ryan tell me, how could we possibly get access to a roof top, is not the balcony enough?" you heard him laugh "It was just a suggestion, plus it sounded exciting at the time." he said turning off the shower, and you refused to reply going back to brushing your teeth. You watched through the mirror as Ryan got out and wrapped a towel around his waist before joining you at the sink. You turned back to your reflection "No comment?" you shook your head not stopping your brushing. He stood there with folded arms watching you, you bent over to spit and wash out your mouth. That's when you felt Ryan moved behind you, placing his hands on your hips before you stood back up, and meeting his gaze in the mirror "Just think about it?" and you smiled leaning your head to the side as Ryan placed his body right up against yours from behind "Blow job on a roof top, if I didn't know any better I would say you just want to get into trouble with the authorities." you gave him a raised brow and he rested his head on your shoulder, bringing both his arms to connect in front of you resulting in pulling you closer against him "But I am the authorities." Ryan said smugly bringing his lips to connect with your neck, all you could do was smile and shake your head "I'll think about it." you felt him smile "Thank you." "It's only because I love you, but for now we could just settle for the mirror." that made him stop what he was doing and met your eyes in the mirror with a huge grin growing on his face "You will be the death of me Mrs. Wolfe." Ryan said before giving you all the loving you deserved.
