            "My beautiful queen, your husband is home." Ryan said cheerfully coming in through the door "Kitchen." Ryan heard and followed your voice after discarding his things "Hello my love." Ryan said when he entered the kitchen approaching you to give you such a love filled kiss "It seems like you had a good day." you said smiling up at him, he moved away from you discarding his jacket "Eh, it was a normal day, but it's what happened that gave me a different outlook on life." "I'm listening." you were currently in front the stove stirring a pot of soup "I watched this couple go through a very nasty divorce, it was crazy." "And what outlook did you get from this couple." "How lucky I am to have you in my life and how appreciative I am to have you." you smiled at him "They were that bad?" "You have no idea. They went as far as dividing their house with a laser that alarms when crossed." "Wow, talk about extreme." Ryan sighed "Please let's never get divorced." you chuckled "Just don't do anything that's going to cause me too, then we're good." Ryan leaned over the counter "Won't happen, I promise, cause a life without you sounds miserable." you chuckled "Don't worry, we won't get there. What other crazy things did they do?" "They destroyed a boat with a shot gun and chain saw." your eyes widen, now finishing up with the soap "That's definitely crazy. The poor boat, she didn't deserve it." Ryan laughed at that, getting two bowls from the cupboard. "The wife also sold the husbands' Lamborghini for two hundred dollars." now you were amazed "So some lucky person got that car for just two hundred dollars, damn." you said filling the bowls with soup that Ryan got "Wish it was me, cause that's a steal." "Ryan what would you do with a Lamborghini?" you asked as you both walked to the dining room with bowls in hand "Of course drive it." "But it doesn’t suit you. So then it would be better for you to buy it then sell it off for it's true value." he looked at you as you both sat down "I did not think of that. That's definitely smarter." "I'm not surprised you didn’t." you chuckled "Leave me be." with that you both sat and ate dinner.

            "So what's like a definite reason for divorce, something that can’t be fixed?" Ryan asked as you both were brushing your teeth, you spat out before replying "Cheating, in my opinion, that destroys a marriage. If you cheat, I'm not fixing anything with you or are we getting back together." Ryan listened on "I guess it's a good thing that I'm a one woman kind of man." you looked towards him in the mirror "You've never cheated on a partner before?" Ryan shook his head "I don't believe in it, when I'm with someone, I'm with them, and you're all I see and love. And if it doesn’t seem like it's not working out anymore, end it, no need to cheat." that made you smile because you share the same views "I like how you think Mr. Wolfe." you chuckled before washing out your mouth "It's common sense in my opinion." Ryan said before washing out his mouth as well "You would think so, but people aren't that smart." you said checking out your teeth in the mirror "Sadly." Ryan said then turned to face you "So if it's not cheating in a marriage, it's something you would work on before getting a divorce?" Ryan asked seriously and you nodded "Other things I can forgive and we can work through them cause that's what marriage is all about." you said leaving the bathroom and Ryan followed "Why, are you thinking of doing something stupid?" Ryan shook his head chuckling "Of course not, I feel like you'll kill me." you turned back quick to give him a look "Once you know." you faked evil laugh "Damn, I'm married to a witch." and you gasped "How dare you find out my secrets. Not so loud, no one must know." you said playing along which caused Ryan to laugh. You both got ready for bed, and was settled in, tv playing and you both laid side by side watching. "I love you" you heard Ryan say so you smiled and looked at him "And I love you." with that you both turned back to the tv and getting lost in the show.
