            Ryan just came home and greeted you, taking off his jacket, so you saw he had a green shirt on underneath "You know what's something I've realized?" you asked while getting up from the sofa coming towards Ryan "And what is that?" he asked resting his hands on your waist "That you wore green an awful lot during the first year of our marriage, and " you paused gesturing to his shirt "you continue to do so into our second year." you titled your head to the side and a smile graced Ryan's face "I started doing it for your sake then it became a habit, plus the smile on your face brings me joy." that made you smile and leaned up to kiss him "Is it just that or the fact that you wearing green sometimes turns me on?" you raised a brow and Ryan chuckled "Well, there is that too." "There it is, cheeky you are." "But you love it, don't deny it." "I was never going to." you gave him a smirk and Ryan caught on "Is this it, is it happening?" Ryan asked with a raised brow, hands travelling down to your bum, you shrugged your shoulders "Maybe." you tiptoed and slowly connected your lips with Ryans' kissing him passionately first then heated, that resulted in Ryan leaning forward placing his hands the back of your thighs lifting you up and you wrapped them around his waist as he started to move in the direction of the bedroom.

            Ryan was telling you of his day while you both were laying your side facing each other and he was talking about Natalia "I'm surprised they kept her on after that, but look at you training someone. Remember when that was you?" a proud smile plastered on your face "It honestly felt like yesterday, but it's been two years, wow." "And I am very happy that I got to see you take that amazing step." you reached forward and grazed his cheek "And I thank you for being here, through it all." "There is nowhere else I would rather be." you offered a smile and Ryan returned it with a kiss. "So Ryan…" he sighed "Oh boy, I know that tone, what did I do wrong?" he said going back to his side but leaning on his elbow this time and you matched him "Were you hard on Natalia?" "What do you mean?" "You know what I mean Mr. Wolfe, after finding out she was the mole and then you having to take her out with you since she became CSI, were you hard on her?" Ryan was about to speak but you cut him off "And don't lie to me cause I already know the truth, I know my husband." he sighed and released a faint smile "Fine, I may have been hard on her, and may have thrown a harsh comment her way." your eyes widen and you smacked him "Ryan you did not." you sighed "What was the comment?" he shook his head "I really don't want to say it." you gave him a look sitting up now "It was that bad?" he nodded "Tell me." "Come on Heather, don't make me say it." you gave him a stern look now "Why?" he sat up now looking at you with pleading eyes "Because I was in the wrong for what I said, and it was a really low blow that I took at her, I was just angry in the moment because of what just happened and maybe pent up anger from her overall and I know the moment you hear, you're going to be very pissed off at me." you sat and thought for a moment, registering what Ryan said, and he was correct, you were getting a little angry, but you tried to calm down yourself and decided to allow him to see the situation from a different perspective "Okay, then think about this, what if someone told what you said to her to me?" he sighed "Come on babe, don't put it like that." "Why not?" "Cause this is different" "Ryan, how is this different, this is the same thing, the same way it happened to her, it could easily happen to me with a coworker at work. Now I don't know exactly what you told her, but I just want you to get my point and for you to think before you say something you regret." Ryan paused for a moment and allowed the words you just told him to process through his mind, he remained quiet a while so you spoke "Doesn't feel good does it?" he shook his head "No, it doesn't and I shouldn't have done it." "Did you at least apologize to her?" Ryan nodded "I did, after I calmed down, I realized what I've done." "Good. You can be so mean sometimes." you said wrapping the blanket around your body getting up from the bed "Are you mad at me?" you paused and turned back to look at him offering a sad smile his direction "I'm not mad, just disappointed." with that you turned and retreated to the bathroom to shower.

            You were in the kitchen working on dinner when Ryan entered, but you didn’t hear him because you were playing music and swaying your hips dancing, backing Ryan. He made way to the island and sat down watching you. Seeing you dance brought a smile to his face, and it immediately left when he remembered that he not too long ago disappointed you, so sighing he alerted his presence "You're not going to divorce me right?" you heard Ryan's voice that made you pause what you were doing to turn and look at him "How long were you there for?" "Not long, I just got here." you gave a look before replying "No Ryan, I'm not going to divorce you." you offered him a smile and saw his face, he was still being hard on himself, and you figured he's suffered enough and learnt his lesson, so you waved your hand at him "Come." he got up and came over to you, while you turned up the music a little louder. You reached out your hand which he took "Dance with me." he hesitantly smiled before placing his hand on your waist and you brought your free hand to his shoulder. After getting in position you both started to sway slowly to the music, and you saw Ryan's face was starting to lighten up "When I'm that way with you, it's not because I hate you or anything, it's just I want you to see what you did wrong, and how it affects the other person, so that going forward you can be better." Ryan's heart swelled and he smile, how did he get so lucky to have you "Thank you, for being an amazing wife, one that makes me a better person." you smiled up at him bringing your hand from his shoulder to rub at the back of his head "You're welcome, just stop making stupid decisions."  he chuckled "Yes mam, I'm trying." "Try harder Wolfe." he smiled down at you with a nod "I will." "Good." you tiptoed and pecked his lips before placing your head on his chest as you guys continued to sway to the music playing from the radio.
