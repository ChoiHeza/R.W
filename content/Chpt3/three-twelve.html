            You and Ryan were currently on the couch, him watching tv and you with your laptop on your lap working away. Your feet were in Ryan's lap while he was massaging your calves. "Babe, you know everything I tell you is in secrecy right?" you nodded not looking away from your laptop "Of course." "Do you remember Natalia's ex-husband, the one I told you about?" "Yeah of course, how could I forget him, trash of a man." "Well, then I guess you would love to hear that he got killed today." that made you look away from your screen towards Ryan with a gasp "He did? I guess he deserved it." Ryan shook his head "Murder is wrong babe." "I know but he was a very bad man. I mean for goodness sake, he used to abuse Natalia. So, how did she take it?" Ryan thought for a moment "She was hurt because at the end of the day, they were married at one point but I think it's more because of what happened recently." now your interest was piqued, saving your work and resting your laptop on the coffee table, you gave Ryan your full attention and that caused him to chuckle "Spill." "Apparently she's been sleeping with him." your mouth widen and your hand went up to cover it "She's been what!?" hands up now trying to understand what Ryan just told you "This the same ex-husband that abused her?" and Ryan nodded while looking at the facial expressions that your face was going through because you were trying to understand, how could she do this "I am so sorry to say this, knowing that she's your coworker but she's awful. I'm sorry. Because there is no way, a man that used to abuse me would ever get to be with me again, in any shape or form. Why would you go back to that shit, do you not have some self-respect for yourself, because I don't think she does." Ryan just listened intently to your ranting and understood where you came from "But no offense." Ryan raised his hands "Babe, you're entitle to your own opinions, and I'm with you on this one." you still couldn't believe she did something like that "I want to ask a question, it might be sensitive if you don’t mind." "I don’t mind, ask away." Ryan sighed before asking his question "What would you do, if you were in an abusive relationship?" you thought for a moment "I would like to think, that I would fight back and leave, knowing that I don't deserve that." Ryan was watching you intently and sensed there was a but "But?" he asked "But, you never truly know what it's like until you're actually in that situation." Ryan understood, out stretching his hand towards you to take it and he pulled you closer to him "With me, you don't feel like you're in any danger right?" you softly smiled and captured his face between your hands "Not once have I ever not felt safe with you. You make me feel the complete opposite. So loved and safe, you're my home." that brought a smile to Ryan's face because that's all he wants when it comes to you "You're completely sure?" you nodded giving him a peck "I'm completely sure." to lighten the mood you decided to ask "What about me, do I make you feel safe?" Ryan chuckled at your question "I am threatened by your every waking moment. You're the scariest person I've ever met." you just laughed at his reply "As you should be." he joined you in laughter "Don’t worry babe, I feel completely safe with you, and your very tiny figure." you smacked his chest "Mind you, if we had to fight I would kick your ass." you try to threaten but Ryan just found you adorable. He was looking at you with loving eyes "What?" you asked "Nothing, you're just really adorable." you threw slits his way before tackling him, bringing him down into your hold, using all your strength to try to keep him trapped, and it completely caught him off guard, and he was surprised with the strength you had so quickly he tapped your hand and you released him "Wow, damn." Ryan said trying to catch his breath so you raised a brow at him "Still think I'm adorable?" he nodded confidently "Of course I do, but that was pretty impressive. I never knew you could of done that." "I know a few things." you winked at him "So does that mean, you would be interested in going to the gym with me?" Ryan asked with a hopeful look "Why?" "To work on your strength, plus it would settle my heart more knowing that you can defend yourself when by yourself." you thought for a moment "That doesn't sound like a bad idea, maybe I can work on my butt as well." Ryan's ears perked at that and his hands went into a clasped praying position "Please say yes." that made you chuckle "Yes Ryan, I will come to the gym with you." Ryan immediately brought you into his embrace smothering you with kisses "Thank you, thank you." you giggled at his actions and Ryan could not have been more happy.
