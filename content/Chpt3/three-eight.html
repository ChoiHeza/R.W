            Tough cases like these where women are kidnapped, they always reminds Ryan of you, so today was a pretty rough day for him, and he just couldn’t wait to get home and be caught up in your embrace for the rest of the day. Coming in he greeted you but got no reply, and that's when he heard the noise of the vacuum cleaner working, and usually you hate the loud noise it gives so you wear headphones listening to music to block out the noise. Ryan quickly took off his shoes and made his way to you. Reaching the entrance of the living room he saw your back was towards him, so he leaned against the wall, watched and waited till you turned off the machine. It wasn't long before you did, so he pushed himself off and walked over to you quietly, and the moment he was right up behind you, his arms engulfed you. You released a quick gasp and that caused Ryan to chuckle. So quickly taking off your headphones, you took hold of Ryan's arms around you "Hey. You know a normal greeting is a thing." you said with a smile, "I know but every chance I get I love to surprise you." you turned in his arms to look at him "Hey, you mad at me?" you shook your head "Of course not, just caught me off guard." you brought your hands up to wrap around his neck and he smiled down at you "You sure?" he asked and you nodded "Yes baby, I'm sure." and before he had chance to ask you again, you leaned up and placed a quick kiss on his lips. Pulling away you settled back down on your feet and looked up at him as he clasped his hands behind your back and you massaged the back of his head "How was work today?" Ryan released a huge sigh while closing his eyes "Pretty rough. Both the case and the day." you brought your hands down to his shoulders and massaged "You know I'm always all ears." you smiled up at him and he opened his eyes "I know, but all I want to do right now is just hold you." Ryan said bringing his head into the joint of your neck and shoulder inhaling your scent "I've got you." you brought your hands to circle tightly around him. With his arms around you he lifted you up causing you to giggle as he walked towards the couch and he sat down bringing you with him to lay down. "Give me ten minutes just like this." Ryan said pulling you closer into him as you guys cuddled on the couch "Take as long as you need."

            You guys stayed there longer than ten minutes, because Ryan really needed it and you weren't one to deny him the comfort that he needed. You heard him groan from within your neck "What's wrong?" "I got to pee." he said sighing while untangling himself from you before getting up causing you to chuckle. "Go go." after he disappeared you got up yourself and headed for the kitchen to heat up dinner. While there, Ryan poked his head around the corner "Have you showered already?" you nodded "Yeah, why?" "No reason really, because I'm about to shower and was looking for a buddy." you laughed at that "Next time buddy." he laughed as well before disappearing and you turned back to the stove. Just as you were placing the plates of food on the counter, Ryan entered wearing basketball shorts and a t-shirt fresh from the shower. "Did you survive without me?" you asked him with a raised brow as he walked over to the fridge "I made do. It wasn't the best but what could you do." you chuckled and watched as Ryan got the water jug from the fridge. So you grabbed two glasses and sat while Ryan joined you. While eating dinner you both talked about your day "So you're nowhere near done?" Ryan asked because you guys were talking about your project so you shook your head "Nope, but progress takes time." "I wish I could help." "Maybe. In the future." a hopeful look entered Ryan's eyes "But enough of my day, what about yours, this tough case?" "Woman being kidnapped, those cases are never easy." "You thought about me didn't you?" you asked him sort of knowing the answer because you know Ryan, he nodded before looking up to you "Of course I did, it's hard not to." you rest down your fork and reached out for his hand "Nothing is going to happen to me okay." he took hold of it and gave a squeeze "I know, but my mind still can't help but wonder sometimes." you smiled and released his hand reaching up to flick his forehead "Then stop wondering because it's not going to happen." he massaged the spot you flicked faking a painful sound causing you to scoff "Like I could ever physically hurt you." you went back to eating your food "If you try really hard, you could succeed." you gave him a glare "Don't make me actually hurt you Ryan Wolfe." and he held up his hands in defense "Wouldn't even dare to." you shot a smile his way "Good, now continue telling me about your day." "One of the women kidnapped was actually Natalia's sister." your eyes widened "Ah really? You guys got to her in time?" Ryan nodded "Yeah but we almost lost her because of Erika." you just chuckled "What is it she did this time?" Ryan explained to you and you just couldn't help but shake your head "Someone has to teach her a lesson." your mind entered into a series of thoughts and Ryan watched you because he knew your thinking face, so he squinted his eyes before asking "What are you thinking babe and don't say nothing because I know that face?" you broke out of it and shook your head "Just work." Ryan didn't buy it, not one bit "You know I don't believe you but whatever it is that you do, just don't get caught." you gave Ryan a smug look "So are you saying that you won't stop me if I do something to teach her a lesson?" you asked with a raised brow at the end "Ryan acted nonchalant "I have no idea what you're talking about babe." he said before giving you a wink at the end "Have I ever told you that I love you so much." you smiled towards him which he returned "Many a time, and I never get tired hearing it." your smile grew wider so you quickly got up and went for your laptop before returning. The scheming begins because Erika needs to be stopped "What are you doing? It's dinner time." "Work." you said with a wink and Ryan caught on but shook his head "No baby, 'work' can wait, I want to enjoy dinner with my wife." you sighed closing your laptop "Fine. I'll 'work' later." "Good, thank you." you gave a thin line smile before turning back to your food. Ryan gasped making you look up "I forgot to mention, I cracked a safe today." your ears perked and eyes widened "You know how to crack safes?" Ryan nodded proudly "I learnt from Uncle Ron at a pretty young age." "How is it that I never knew this information before?" "I guess a situation never occured for it to come up." you nodded agreeing "But still, that's so cool babe. My husband knows how to crack safes. That's a nice skill." Ryan just chuckled at your behaviour "Please don’t judge me, I just love finding out new things about you." you told him truthfully "I'm not judging. I'm just finding you cute." he offered a smile "Also that means that I'm cool as well." "What do you mean?" "You're like crazy smart with your computer stuff and that makes you amazing by what you do. You guys build programs that we use at work to make our jobs so much easier and that's really impressive." you chuckled at that and felt proud "But baby you're also amazing. You catch bad guys for a living and solve crimes. You do what I see in detective pictures for a living and that's pretty impressive also." Ryan smiled and thought about what you said for a minute "I guess you're right, I just never looked at it to be cool, but hearing it come from you makes me sound pretty badass." "That's because you are badass." Ryan's heart swelled with pride at what you said "My wife thinks I'm a badass." "No baby, I don’t think you are, I know you are." Ryan's love for you grew even more in that moment and he couldn't stop smiling "Thank you." "For what?" "Making me feel special." you got up at that and stood in front of Ryan taking hold of his face "That's because you are Ryan. You are special and I love you." you leaned down capturing his lips making him smile into the kiss, at times like this he doesn't feel like he deserves you but also times like this makes him want to be a better man, a better husband for you "And I love you." he said looking up at you after the kiss "I know." you smiled before placing a kiss to his forehead. That caused him to wrap his arms around your waist pulling you close against him resting his head on your chest as you massaged the back of his head "I promise to be a great husband to you." you felt his arms tighten "You already are." Ryan smiled at that but he will still try to be better.
