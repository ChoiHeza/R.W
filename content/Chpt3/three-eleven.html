            Ryan was up way before you and he was currently rummaging through the closet looking for the perfect outfit to wear today, but his actions woke you up so with a groan so you asked "Ryan Wolfe, what on God's green earth are you doing right now?" his head snapped towards your direction as he saw you covering your head with the blanket "Sorry babe, did I wake you?" you sighed and uncovered yourself "No you didn't, because you were being very quiet." "I do apologize, but I'm having a problem." sighing once more you sat up and looked at him "What is the problem?" he turned to you with two suit combos in hand "Which one looks best?" he asked as he held up a grey suit with an orange shirt and a black suit with a blue shirt "Both look great, but why the big fuss?" you asked stretching waking up your body more "Because I'm being filmed today for a documentary, and I want to look the part." your eyes widened at that "Wait what? Since when did this happen?" Ryan thought for a moment before realizing he forgot to tell you, so sending a shy smile your way he replied "I may have forgotten to tell you." you raised a brow to let him know that you're listening "The mayor's office wants our lab's work documented so someone had to take the bullet and I decided to accept it." you listened and thought for a moment while moving to the edge of the bed to hang your feet off "Honestly I don't like the sound of it, being followed by a camera while working, especially in your line of work but if you're okay with it." "I know, it’s sketchy but the point is to make our lab look good." you nodded and stood slowly making your way to Ryan "And a good suit is going to help with that?" you asked with a chuckle and Ryan joined "Got to start somewhere." in front of him now, you looked better at the suits with the new information in mind "The black suit but a different colour shirt." you said moving around him to look in the closet. Looking through the button ups he owns your eyes landed on the perfect one "This one." you said pulling out the purple button up placing it with the black suit in his hands. Ryan looked and loved it "It’s perfect babe, thank you." he kissed your forehead and you waved your hand "You're welcome." offering a smile up at him before moving away to head to the bathroom "Do you have to shower?" Ryan asked and you nodded "Okay, I'll get started on breakfast then." "Okay." you disappeared to the bathroom leaving Ryan in the bedroom.

            You were done dressed for work and was in the office corner packing the remainder of your things that you need for work "So, do I look camera ready?" you heard Ryan's voice making you look around and you whistled "Doesn't my husband look gorgeous." that brought a wide smile to Ryan's face as he approached you "So I take you like?" "I love." he was in front you now and your hands ran along the front of his jacket "Thank you. My wife does have the best taste." you smiled and winked at him "And the haircut, I could just eat you up right now." Ryan chuckled checking his watch "How can you say that knowing I don't even have time to indulge you in your fantasies." he sighed so to tease you leaned up and left an open mouth kiss on the side of his neck "Come on babe, don't make me late." you chuckled "I'm not doing anything." you said turning back to the desk continuing what you were doing. You could still feel Ryan hovering behind you "If you don't leave now you're going to be late." you heard Ryan sighed before he replied "Ugh, you're so mean sometimes." you turned back to him quickly "Go, I don't want you being late on your big day." you leaned up and placed a gentle kiss on his lips "Okay but we will continue this later." you nodded "Wish me luck." "You got this babe. I believe in you." "Thank you." Ryan smiled down at you and gave you a kiss of his own "Okay, I'm going now. You have a good day at work as well." "I will." you guys shared a smile and Ryan kissed your forehead before he was gone.

            Ryan got home before you because worked carried on later than usual, so after you left the building you decided to buy Ryan a bouquet of flowers. It would be a first, but you would like it to become a thing, because he's always buying you flowers so you would like to be the one giving the flowers for a change. Entering the shop you heard the bells jingle above letting the owner know of your presence. It was honestly your first time in here and you were feeling overwhelmed "Good evening, I'll be with you in a minute." you heard a female voice said from the back of the shop "No problem." you replied back as you started to look over the flowers they had to offer, and you don't know how Ryan makes his choice whenever he comes here. "Hi, how may I help you?" you heard the voice behind you making you turn around and before you could of said anything the lady cut you off "Wait, I know you, you're Ryan's wife aren't you?" a smile graced your face and nodded "Yes I am, how did you know?" she chuckled "Ryan has a habit of showing me a picture of you when buying flowers because he's always overwhelmed with the different kinds we have here, so with a picture I make them based on the vibe the person gives off in the picture. Plus Ryan is one of my best customers, you can say he is a regular." that lifted your heart and made you smile widely "Well you do a very good job, because every bouquet he's brought home I've loved every single one of them." now it was her turn to smile widely at you "Thank you very much, that means I'm doing my job very well. So what brings the wife here, come to buy yourself some flowers?" "Actually, I came to buy Ryan a bouquet, I think it would be nice to get him one for a change and hopefully make it a habit." "That sounds like a very good idea, anything you have in mind?" you looked around and she saw the overwhelming look in your eyes and chuckled "Well, his favourite colours are orange and red." you said and she nodded "Okay, I could work with that." she said and immediately got to work, so you watched as she put together a set and asking you if it's okay and she was doing an amazing job. When finished she showed you the final product "What do you think?" she asked and you smiled loving how it looked "It's perfect, he's going to love it." you paid and you guys exchanged a few more words before you left and headed for your next destination. You stopped at Ryan's favourite food place and picked up his favourite order and with everything you needed you head for home.

        <p class="story">"
            Honey, I'm home" you said coming in through the apartment door and in an instance you heard Ryan making his way towards you, so quickly you hid the flowers behind your back. The moment he came into view, there was a smile on his face "Hey. Let me help you." he took the take out from your hand and your work bags from your shoulder "What's this?" he asked gesturing to the take out bag "I bought you your favourite food, from your favourite place." the smile on his face widen but before he could say something you continued "But that's not all." you said as you brought the flowers from behind your back and a confused look crossed Ryan's face "Someone bought you flowers?" you chuckled shaking your head "No, these are for you. I bought you flowers." his eyes widen with surprise "You bought me flowers?" your head rapidly nodded, smile never leaving your lips "Wait, let me rest down these things." He went and rest down the bags before returning to you so you out stretched your hands as he took the flowers from you "Do you like them?" he was looking between you and the flowers in his hands, not sure how to feel "I love them actually, but I'm just confused. Why did you buy me flowers?" you shrugged while going to take off your shoes "I felt like buying my husband flowers, because he always get them for me, and I wanted to change that for once." The smile on Ryan's face widened and he immediately closed the distance between you two and brought his right hand to wrap around your waist "Thank you baby, they're beautiful." he looked down at you before placing a passionate kiss on your lips. Pulling away he looked at you before looking back at the flowers "So this is how you feel whenever I bring you flowers, this is nice. I could get used to this." you smiled up at him "And you even brought me food. How did you get so perfect." "Because my husband is lovely." you pecked a kiss to his lips before stepping out his arms heading to the kitchen "But I am starving and I would love to hear about your day Mr. Documentary." Ryan released a huge sigh "Uh oh, that's not a good sigh."</p>
        <p class="story">
            "Were you able to make things right?" Ryan was explaining to you how he screwed up today destroying crucial evidence while being filmed "Yeah. It definitely wasn't easy, but I know better now." "And that camera guy didn't get to your head right?" Ryan shook his head while still eating "Of course not" "Then I'm very proud of you. So will he be back tomorrow?" "I hope not, I hated it. And hopefully he got everything he needed today." "For your sake, let’s hope he doesn't." with that you guys finished eating. "Thank you so much babe." Ryan said turning to you "What for?" "For being an amazing wife. It's like you sensed my day was crap so you made it better." a smile graced your face "Well, I am thankful that I could of made it better. And is there anything I can do to make it the best?" with that Ryan smirked and you chuckled because you knew exactly what he was thinking "I believe there was something that needed to be continued from this morning." Ryan said as you got up beginning to clear away the crates. "I'm not sure what you're talking about." with the trash in hands you went over to the bin. "Oh really. You have no idea what I'm talking about?" you shook your head going to the sink to wash your hands "No clue to what you mean." your back was turned to Ryan the whole time "Hm, I guess I can help you remember." with that you heard Ryan got up and came behind you to stand, hands going either side of you gripping the counter trapping you there. His face went into the crook of your neck inhaling your scent "Remember anything as yet?" smiling you shook your head "No" with that Ryan started placing kisses along your neck making you hum. Wanting more, you turned to face Ryan and he was leaning over, looking down at you "What's wrong? Memory jogged?" he said smirking down at you so rolling your eyes you brought your hands to wrap around his waist "Maybe, but I need a bit more to remember." Ryan wasted no time in connecting his lips with yours in a heated kiss. Bending lower, Ryan lifted you up and brought you to sit on the counter not once breaking the kiss. "How about we move this to the shower?" you said pulling away going to place kisses along his jaw "Yes mam." he quickly lifted you, wrapping your legs around his waist making you giggle, heading off to the bathroom.
