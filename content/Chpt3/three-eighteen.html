            With the tv on in the background, Ryan currently had his head laying in your lap telling you about the confrontation he had with Eric that morning "At least you weren't a jerk when you told him right, cause you know how you can be sometimes?" you felt Ryan shook his head "Of course not. But I told him I was where he is now. Feeling like everyone is attacking you based on the injury you had but it's just them looking out for you because they care, but at the end of the day he's like me." you nodded completely understanding "Feels like you're incompetent and people are blaming you because you're not completely yourself and you could lose your job." "Exactly like that." you continued playing with Ryan's hair sighing "Just give him some time, unless you want me to talk to him for you." "Nah, you don’t have to. I can handle Delko." you chuckled "I know you can. Just continue being a supporting friend and not a jerk, like when he argues or feels like the world is against him, reassure him." Ryan smiled up at you "Like what you do with me?" "Exactly like I do with you." you smiled back. "Okay, I can do that." he said before looking towards the tv "Besides Eric, your day was good?" "It was pretty interesting honestly. Met triplets for the first time today." "I think I remember seeing that on the news, but that famous guy wasn't actually dead. So why did they do it?" you asked Ryan curious because the news reporter never said the cause "Because of money." "Seriously? I mean, I guess I can see it, the guy was loaded but was love not enough." "I don't think love was there to begin with." "That's honestly sad. People marry you just for your status and wealth, just to kill you a couple years later." you shook your head in disbelief "Yup. The world is definitely a messed up place." "Maybe I should stop making more money than you. Cause one day you might decide to kill me for what I have." Ryan laughed turning to look up at you "You don’t make more money than me." that made you look down at him with a smile "Ryan Wolfe, how much do you think I make a year?" you saw the gears turning in his head before saying "Like sixty k a year?" and you laughed, that made Ryan sit up now really curious. Honestly you guys never got into the nitty gritty of how much you each made a year, cause it was never a problem. "Why are you laughing, am I wrong?" you nodded "Want to make another guess?" "I'm afraid to, what is it?" you took your time, to prepare Ryan for the answer "You ready?" he nodded "Double your answer and add some." Ryan's eyes widen "You make 120 k a year?!" he asked in a loud whisper shocked voice and you nodded "Yes sir." Ryan leaned forward, head going into his hands contemplating his life "Wait, I need a minute." you tapped his shoulder "It's okay. Take your time." very quietly you heard Ryan mumble "I only make 70 k a year." Ryan had a lot to register "So when you said, you would handle the bills, rent, and groceries so I can pay off my debt you weren't joking?" Ryan said sitting up now looking at you "Yeah, I meant it, but you refused to me let do it." you rolled your eyes "Wow." Ryan was still in shock "Is this going to be a problem?" Ryan quickly turned back to you "No baby, not at all. I'm actually pretty proud of you, and the fact that you're going for promotion, which I assume is going to be more money." you nodded "Way more, cause I would also be employed by the CSI department." Ryan eyes widen and you realized you said too much "Wait, hold on. The promotion comes with employment at where I work?" you button your lips shut, not giving away any reactions "Come on baby, say something. Don’t leave me in suspense." you sighed with your head falling back avoiding Ryan's gaze "I wasn't supposed to say anything. Me and my stupid big mouth." "Why not?" "Because, I wanted it to be a surprise if I got the promotion." Ryan couldn’t contain his smile "Babe look at me." sighing you leaned up meeting his eyes "We already know you're getting it, and believe me when I say this, I am very very proud of you." "You sure none of this is a problem?" Ryan shook his head "This is all amazing, it just shows how amazing you are. I think you have one of the best jobs I've ever seen. And I mean it." that made you smile "Thank you." Ryan just couldn't stop smiling because he was so proud of you "So, since you know how much I make, will you let me help?" you asked with hopeful eyes and Ryan sighed hugely "You really want to?" you gave him an obvious look "Am I not your wife?" he nodded "Then yes Ryan, I want to help so let me." Ryan thought for a moment "Okay, but if it ever becomes too much, let me know. Promise me." you nodded "Promise." you said holding out your pinky causing Ryan to chuckle but he played along and hooked his with yours "I love marriaging with you." you commented and Ryan chuckled "You know that's not a word right." "I know, but you get what I'm trying to say." Ryan nodded "I do and I love you deeply for that." he said pulling you into his side "And I love you." you smiled at each other before sharing a kiss and turning back to the tv "I still can't believe you make 120 k." you smacked his chest "Let it go Ryan, it's not enough to kill me over." he chuckled "I'll be the judge of that." you just rolled your eyes focusing back on the tv.
