            Ryan was currently at the crime scene with Alexx and Natalia and was looking on as Alexx assessed the body. Natalia was the first to leave after collecting enough evidence and Ryan remained there with Alexx as she continued what she was doing. "What is that there?" Alexx asked and Ryan leaned in closer getting his tweezers "Looks like a hair." "It looks dark." "Yeah, African-American." Ryan stated and Alexx gave him a look "What, I said that because it looks like Heather's when she straightens it." Ryan said defending himself "Okay baby." she offered him a smile calming. While at the scene, they saw the victim used to wear a ring so they decided to figure it out back at the lab. As Alexx was in the morgue with her live camera feed, Ryan was in the lab in front the computer with the program open waiting on Alexx to take pictures of the finger "You ready honey?" Alexx asked Ryan after she was finished setting up "Yes mam." so they got started on taking the pictures and Ryan analyzing them. "So this fancy program of yours is going to tell us what this ring looks like?" "Pretty much." "That's impressive, thank God for technology." "It is and you want to know an interesting fact about this program?" Ryan asked as he typed away on the keyboard "And what is that baby?" Alexx asked curious "My wife helped build this program that we're using." Ryan said with such a proud smile and Alexx ears perked up at that "Really? Now that's pretty impressive." "I know right and I'm so proud of her for it." Ryan couldn't stop smiling "I can hear it in your voice. How are you two doing by the way?" Alexx asked as they continued to work "Weâ€™re doing great actually. As all happy married couples are." Ryan and Alexx continued talking while working.

            The day went by pretty quickly and was a bit of a roller coaster but before Ryan knew it, his shift was over and he was entering through the door of your shared apartment. "Honey I am home and in need of your loving." Ryan said as he took off his shoes but he heard nothing "Babe, you home?" Ryan asked as he shed his jacket and went in search for you "Heather?" he realized you weren't home yet "And I'm talking to no one." checking his phone he looked to see if there was any miss calls or texts from you but nothing, so he just figured you were working late. Since you'll be too tired to come home and cook he decides to go and buy take out, so heading back to the apartment door he took up his keys and put on his shoes and was back through the door. In the mean while that Ryan was gone, you managed to get home with take out in hand because you would have been too tired to cook. "Babe, I'm home, sorry for being late" you said entering resting down your stuff before taking off your shoes, but you were met with silence "Ryan?" you entered further and checked around realizing he wasn't there, but heading to the kitchen to rest down the food you saw his jacket. Meaning he came home but clearly left again because his keys were gone so just as you were about to pull out your phone to call him is when you heard the apartment door opened then followed his voice "I see you're finally home." you figured he was referring to the shoes "Just got in. Kitchen." you said back taking the food from the bags placing them out. When Ryan entered he just laughed and that made you look up and instantly saw what was so funny "That's where you went, to buy food?" he nodded chuckling now "I decided to go out and buy food because you'll be too tired to cook when you came in." you laughed at that "That's my same reason for buying food." "I guess great minds think alike." Ryan said approaching you resting the take out bag on the counter "Or foolishly." you said chuckling referring to the two sets of take out and Ryan joined. "Then I guess we were definitely meant for each other." he said kissing your temple and that made you smile "So what are we going to do?" you asked looking up at him.

            You guys decided to use half of each take out and left the rest for tomorrow. The food was digested and skin freshly washed and you both were feeling lazy so currently you guys were on the couch. You were just wearing one of Ryan's t-shirts while he wore sweat shorts and a t-shirt. Your feet were currently in his lap and he was massaging your calves while you were reading and he was watching tv. A random series was showing that caught Ryan's attention and the only time he looked away was when there was an advert on "We used one of your programs today, Alexx and I." Ryan said turning to look at you but your eyes never left your book "Which one?" "One that can detect shapes based on indentations left behind." you looked away from your book to think for a moment about the program then it hit you looking towards Ryan "I know what you mean. Were you able to get the job done with the software?" Ryan nodded "It worked flawlessly. Even Alexx was impressed." you smiled at that feeling proud "Well I am glad that we can be of service, so what was today's case about?" you asked resting down your book and Ryan explained it to you. "What was the charity?" "I think it was for homeless kids." "So they sold off women for homeless children?" Ryan chuckled at the way you worded it "If you put it like that, it sounds pretty bad." "Yah think. If you want to help just give the money." "You're not wrong." Ryan said turning back to the tv as the show started back and you went back to your book. Sometime passed before a curious thought crossed your mind "How much would you pay for me?" Ryan didn't hear you at first because he was so caught up in the show, so your foot that was in his hand you shifted it to catch his attention and he looked at you "You said something?" you nodded "Yeah, I asked how much would you pay for me?" a smile graced Ryan's face "What do you mean?" "Like if I was one of the women there being auctioned off, how much would you pay?" Ryan didn't had to think or ponder on his answer "I won't have enough money in the world to buy you, because you're priceless." your face heated up at that so you decided to hide behind your book "What? Is that not a good answer?" "It was the perfect answer actually, just wasn't expecting it." the smile on your face growing "Well, it's how I feel about you." you hid your face deeper "Come on babe, stop hiding your face." and you shook your body in protest as a no. Ryan just chuckled and decided to leave you be going back to massaging your legs while watching tv. With your face still hidden in the book you felt Ryan started to move his hand up higher your leg and that caused you to peek over the book to glance at him and you saw there was a faint smile on his lips while his eyes were still glued to the tv. "Stop being a tease Ryan." "Whatever do you mean?" he said not once stopping his actions "Your hand, what is it doing?" you asked with a raised brow "Just touching my wife's soft legs, nothing is wrong with that." "Hmmmm. If you say so." so trying your best to ignore his antics you went back to reading. Just when you were getting back into the groove of reading you felt Ryan squeeze your leg making you hum in a questioning tone "Look at me" you smile deciding to be a tease yourself "Why?" you asked as you flipped the page "So you want to play that game." he said and before you could ask 'what game' Ryan took hold of your legs and pulled you closer to him. He took the book from your hands resting it down open to mark your page before coming to hover over you, going between your legs "Look at me." he demanded this time, but you took your time before your eyes met his. "Good girl." the same heat from before raised to your cheeks again "How may I help you sir?" you asked trying to hide your smile "I just wanted my wife's attention and maybe some of her loving." your smile broke out after he said that so you brought your hands up to intertwine at the back of his neck because who were you to deny this man what he asked for and the same while he brought his hand up under your shirt to grab your waist. He looked deeply into your eyes before asking "Can I kiss you?" that made you chuckle "Why are you asking for permission now?" he shrugged "Felt like it, plus it's been years since I've asked that." "What if I said no?" "Then I would be very heart broken, because my wife doesn't want to kiss me and that wou-" "Just shut up and kiss me already." you cut him off and his eyes darkened at your request with a smile gracing his lips before he connected them with yours.
