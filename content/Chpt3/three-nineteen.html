            "Hey beautiful, I'm home." Ryan said coming in through the door, "Hey hun, I'm in the kitchen." Ryan heard you, so he quickly took off his shoes and made his way to you. "Hey you." he said entering the kitchen and resting his bag down on the counter "Hi, had a good day?" you briefly look towards Ryan not wanting to lose your concentration on the work in front of you "The usually." Ryan was beside you and he leaned down to place a kiss to your temple. "Working?" you nodded "Figured I would get started on some bug fixes." Ryan left from you and headed to the fridge "I just finished cook, so you can help yourself when you're ready." "Ate already?" Ryan asked as he took out a bottle of water and you shook your head "Nah, not hungry." you decided to look away from your computer to look towards Ryan just to drink him in as he was doing his bottle of water. "You looked nice today." you said gesturing to Ryan's outfit "Thanks babe." you were still staring at Ryan as he drank his water "What?" Ryan asked "What what?" you replied with and Ryan chuckled "You're staying at me." "Oh, I wasnâ€™t." you said quickly turning back to your laptop "Uh huh, and I don't find you beautiful." that made you blush, so placing down his water, Ryan made his way over to you and stood behind you "What's up babe, what's going through your mind?" you remained quiet pretending not to hear him "So you can't hear me now?" Ryan chuckled resting his chin on top your head. Still no reply came from you as you typed away on your laptop so that cause Ryan to start placing kisses along your neck.
