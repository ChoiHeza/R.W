            You and Ryan got into a huge fight this morning, it wasn't resolved because to be spiteful Ryan left home wearing pink knowing you're not a fan of the colour, as a way of saying that he's still mad at you. He also did that because you originally picked out and ironed a green button up for him, and that only added more fuel to the fire when he switched the shirt. So when Ryan got work, he wasn't in the best of moods but for the sake of the job he tried his best to push it down, plus Delko was returning back to the field today so he wanted to make sure he felt welcomed. Arriving to the crime scene, and getting the information, he thought how lucky himself must be when he heard the name of the lead suspect. Her name was Heather and Ryan felt like God was punishing him. Just when he thought he could forget about the situation this morning for a little bit, luck was not on his side. Going through the day, was not easy for Ryan due to hearing your name constantly. He had to keep reminding himself that it's not you but that didn’t help one bit. He had to go to Alexx to collect an assault kit, so entering through the morgue doors he greeted her "Hey Alexx, got what I came for?" "Yes baby, just finished, it's right here." she said taking it from the table to give to Ryan. After handing it to him she realized his mood has gotten worst from since this morning, because she's been keeping an eye on him throughout the day realizing he's not his usual cheery self "Hey Ryan, wait a minute." Alexx said taking off her gloves coming around to stand in front Ryan "Yeah sure." "What's wrong baby?" the moment Alexx asked that Ryan immediately tried to hide is expressions "What do you mean? Nothing's wrong." Ryan said with a shake of his head "I wasn't born yesterday hun, I know when something is bothering you, and you haven't been in a good mood all day." sighing, Ryan caved "Heather and I got into a huge fight this morning." he started and explained it to Alexx and she listened "I can see where you both are coming from, but you guys should really sit and talk it out, seeing from each other perspective." Ryan listened to the advice that Alexx shared "Wait Ryan, please don't tell me you home without resolving the fight?" "I didn't, hence the shirt." Alexx looked confused "Heather usually picks out my suits for me and she had a green shirt ironed. It being her favourite colour, but to anger her I switched it out for a pink one, a colour she doesn’t like, before leaving home." Alexx gasped "Ryan Wolfe you did not do that." "I know I know, it was a jerk move and I was very wrong for that." "No shit Ryan. But listen to me baby, in this line of work that we're in, mostly you more than anything, never leave home on bad terms with a spouse, because what happens if you get killed in line of duty God forbid. Do you want you guys' last shared moments one that's bad, no, you don't. That goes for anything, the moment you're leaving each for a while always leave on good terms because you see it every day, life is a very funny thing." Ryan took in everything that Alexx was saying and she was correct. "You're right, you're right. Thank you so much Alexx." they both shared a wide smile "I'm always glad to help baby. Now call her." "Yes mam, also thanks for the kit." Ryan said gesturing to the box in his hand before leaving the morgue and at the same time, he reached for his phone in his pocket. Selecting your name he hit dial while making his way up to the lab. Your cell just went to voicemail, and he has a strong feeling that you're ignoring him, but just to be sure he called again and got the same result. Sighing, he knows that you're ignoring him. This is definitely not his day.

            After your fight with Ryan this morning and how he left home, you just wanted the day to be over and you guys resolve the stupid fight. You were just annoyed now because you had the day to calm down, but what you couldn't let go was the switching of the shirts. And Ryan knew he couldn’t come home empty handed because he was a jerk for what he did with the shirts. So he made sure to make a stop before coming home. When he entered he wasn't sure how to greet you, so to play it safe, he kept it causal "Hey, I'm home." but he was met with silence. Ryan knew you were home because he saw your keys in the dish and your shoes were on the rack. So he rest down his bag before coming more into the apartment to look for you "Heather?" still nothing. Rounding the corner to the living room, Ryan saw the reason why, you were sitting on the sofa with your back turned and headphones on. He assumed you were reading based on the position of your body, so he slowly approached with the flowers in hand, and the moment he got beside you, carefully not to startle you, he brought the flowers into your view to alert you of his presence. The moment you saw them, you jumped a little but was thankful Ryan did it gently because he knows that you startle easily. So pausing your music you took off your headphones and look up to Ryan. He carried a very apologetic face, so sighing, you marked your book before closing it, to give him your attention. Turning your body to face him, Ryan got down on his knees in front of you with flowers still in hand "Heather, I am very sorry for how I left this morning and what I did. First I shouldn't have switched the shirt to just anger you, then leaving home without us resolving the fight. I was very wrong for that." you tried to stop him to let him know that the fight wasn't all his fault but he halted you "No let me explain, because I know you're going to say it's not all my fault but I was wrong, and I over reacted when I shouldn’t have gotten angry at you, I was just worried about you and I don’t want you injured. And after speaking with Alexx today she made me realize that I was a complete jerk, and I should never leave home or you on bad terms. So I am so so so so so sorry for what I've done and I promise to be better going forward knowing how to handle the situation better." Ryan's eyes held sincerity and pain, so sighing, you took the flowers from Ryan's and rest them down beside you, so you can take hold of Ryan's hands in yours. "I accept your apology but I have to apologies myself, because I shouldn't have added to your anger by getting angry myself, because that wasn't very helpful and just made the fight worse, but I am sorry for my behaviour as well, and going forward I will be better, and not be so reckless next time, and instead get help from you. Also thank you for the flowers and thank you for apologizing about the shirt, because that really hurt, you have no idea." you chuckled at the last part gesturing to the shirt Ryan was wearing "I'm really sorry about that, I was just really angry. Wanted to piss you off." "Well, good job at that." Ryan smiled "I'm sorry, I'll change it and make sure to wear my green shirt tomorrow, even with my green socks." that made you smile, but looking at Ryan in the pink shirt with all your anger gone now, and the fight resolved, you realized that Ryan actually looks really nice in it "Maybe don't take it off just yet." Ryan raised a brow in confusion "What do you mean?" "I'm not a lover of pink but for some reason, right now, seeing you in the colour is doing something to me." "Is this a good something or a bad something." you smirked "Definitely a good something." you said running your hands along the front of the shirt, and before Ryan had a chance to say something, you took hold of his collars and brought him towards you, crashing your lips against his. It took Ryan a while to register what was happening, before he caught on, his hands were on your body, deepening the kiss. Quickly running through Ryan's mind was 'Maybe I should invest in more pink shirts.' before going between your legs to wrap them around his body.

            You just existed the bathroom from taking a shower and saw Ryan was still the same way you left him, tangled in the bed sheets. Shaking your head you made way towards the dresser. Ryan heard you enter back the bedroom so he opened his eyes and was watching your every movement. Sensing Ryan's stare, you turned to look at him and saw he was indeed looking at you and had the biggest smile on his face "What's with the wide smile?" "Just you." you giggled "Just me, that's causing you to smile so wide. You kind of look love struck." Ryan laughed and shrugged "Maybe I am, because my wife is gorgeous, she loves me, she's amazing, and maybe sex with her is just the best thing ever." you felt your face heat up with that trying to hide the grin that wants to spread on your face "You're just saying that because you finally got your make up sex." then Ryan's eyes widened in realization making him sit up "I didn't even realize that. You're right." all you could do was shake your head turning back to the dresser "Wow Ryan, so you're saying that sex with me is only good when it's make up sex?" Ryan was quick to dismiss the thought "Of course not. That's not what I meant. Sex with you is always the best, all kinds of sex." you were laughing now at Ryan's explanation "Baby calm down, I was just joking. I knew what you meant from the first time you said it." Ryan sighed falling back on the bed defeated "My wife ladies and gentlemen, the meanest woman ever. Giving out heart attacks like candy." you were full on laughing now. Turning back to Ryan you saw he had a smile on his face, because your laugh was one of his favourite sounds, and he loves it even more when it's him that caused it. "Maybe you should have considered that before you married me." you said getting dressed now "I really did consider it, but then I was like, who needs a healthy heart anyway." your laughter continued. With your shirt on, you walked over to the bed and Ryan moved to the edge to meet you, coming between his legs, he took hold of your thighs "Well I will try my best not to kill you." "Well I think dying by your hands wouldn’t be such a bad thing." Ryan said looking up at you offering the sweetest smile he could offer, you can't just help but love him, you giggled before saying "You know I love you so much right?" he nodded with closed eyes "Yes mam, I know you do, and you know that I love you back just the same right?" it was your turn to copy his previous action and that made him chuckle. "Good." he said and you leaned down to place a sweet kiss on his lips before standing back up and running your hands through his hair, then you remembered something "I forgot to ask, how was Eric's first day back out?" "It was different. He has to get adjusted back, but he will get to his original state in no time." "That's very good." you smiled and Ryan nodded "What do you feel like eating?" you asked "I actually brought home food, didn’t want to make you cook after what I put you through." that made your smile widen "Aren’t you the sweetest." "Of course, well most times. Would you mind heating it up while I go shower?" you shook your head "Not one bit." with that you placed one more peck to Ryan's lips before leaving his hold. "Don't be too long, or I'll start eating without you." "Yes mam." Ryan replied as you were heading for the bedroom exit while he was going to the bathroom.
