            The day Ryan was having was unbelievable, he was never one to believe in curses but after how the day was going he started to believe and just wanted the case to be over. It started at the crime scene with the shrine then a little coffin, after that unspeakable things kept happening, the dead coming back to life and him losing feelings in his hands, then a computer spontaneously combusting, you could say he was a little spook and started to believe in curses. He was currently in the lab staring at the little coffin on the table thinking how was this thing causing all of these problems, then Delko entered breaking him out of his thoughts "Starting to believe?" Eric asked him as he approached and Ryan got up from his position taking his eyes from the coffin "Well, uh, there is a dead guy walking around and I suffered from temporary paralysis. And there was some spontaneous combustion and all that since we brought this thing in here." Ryan said gesturing to the coffin "so yeah, I would have to say Santeria's might have something to do with Alissa's death, sure." Ryan gave Eric a look "Maybe. Maybe not. I decided to look deeper into her divorce." Delko started to explain and Ryan listened "So what were they fighting over? A condo, a car, or something?" Ryan asked facing Delko folding his arms "No, burial plots." Eric replied and Ryan gave him a 'what' look "They already have burial plots?" "It's what happy couples do." Eric said causing both him and Ryan to chuckle "Heather and I haven't even discussed such matter, maybe we should." Ryan said with a raised brow "You should, you guys are a happy couple after all." and Ryan nodded to that with a chuckle then Delko continued explaining the topic and they both realized that burial plots are a good place to hide something, especially the gold that is missing "A graveyard. Yeah, of course." Ryan was leaning over the table now not believing his luck and Eric just gave him a smile knowing what they have to do. When the night was closing in Ryan just called quick to check in on you "Got home safely babe?" he asked "Yes sir, I'm currently getting something to eat then shower then sleep. Since you're not home, I'll turn in earlier than usual." "I'm sorry for the double shift." Ryan apologized "It's okay baby, I don't mind. Work going well?" you asked him as you moved about the kitchen, there was a little silence before you heard him reply "It's going, but don't worry, I will tell you all about it when I come in tomorrow." his reply made you chuckle "Once you're safe." "Trust me, I'm trying, but nothing to worry about." he reassured you and you guys talked for a little more before you bided each other a good night. "Heather?" Eric asked coming into the locker room alerting Ryan's attention and he nodded "Yeah, just wanted to check in on her." "Does she know that her husband is freaking out at work because of a curse?" Ryan got up and pointed a finger towards Delko's direction "No, and she never will because I have no idea what you're talking about." that made Erick laugh "Right. You ready to go?" Ryan nodded while taking a jacket from his locker and following Delko out. They were heading to the graveyard to investigate the burial plots. Let's just say they were both very spooked and jumpy and constantly of telling each other not another word to other people especially from Ryan to Delko to not say anything to you. "I hate this case." Ryan said as they both inspected a dead guy in the graveyard "Yeah, tell me about it." Eric replied back.

            It was the end of the shift and Ryan, Eric and Calleigh were in the lab talking about the coffin, but they realized that it was missing and let's just say Ryan was freaked out. "You know what, this case was not a fun one, and I hated every bit of it, so I will go and take a shower to wash this case off of me before going home to my wife, cause right now I think she's the only one that can make my mind feel sane." Calleigh and Eric laughed at Ryan before they all bid there byes and Ryan went to the locker to shower. After showering and dressing with spare clothes in his locker he messaged quick to let you know that he was on his way home and he's bringing take out.

            You were laying on the sofa reading when you heard Ryan enter "Hey baby." his voice made you jump up from your position because the last time you saw your husband was yesterday morning and boy did you miss him "There he is." you said when he came into view, without wasting anytime, you wrapped yourself around him missing his touch "Somebody missed me." Ryan said wrapping his arms tightly around you, being thankful to be home "You have no idea." his face was now in your hands and you leaned up to connect his lips with yours "I've missed you too." Ryan said after breaking the kiss to look down at you, taking in all your features "After the case I just had, being here with you and seeing your face is just what I need." you massaged his cheeks "Was it a tough case?" he shook his head "Not really, just a spiritual one." he chuckled and you gave him a puzzled look "I'll explain over food." he picked up the take out and you both headed towards the kitchen.

            "I guess I'm never one to believe in curses." you said honestly while eating some fries "The same thing with me, but after everything that has happened to me these pass two days, I started to believe." you chuckled "But babe, everything was explained, the dead guy, your hands, the laptop." you said making point and Ryan nodded "Yeah, they all were, except one." you thought for a moment "The coffin. That part really is sketchy." "Or, it was just simply the curse." you raised a brow "I hope you didn't bring any negative vibes home with you." Ryan smiled "Don't worry babe, I made sure to take a very very good shower before leaving. Don't want to risk anything when it came to you." "Why thank you very much." you offered a smile and leaned forward to peck his lips "Let's finish eat and get to bed cause I know you're very exhausted." "You have no idea." you guys finished eating then headed to the bathroom to wash up then hit the bed.

            The lights off and you both were laying on your pillows waiting till sleep take you off to dream land, and you felt it creeping up when Ryan's voice alerted you "What do you think about couple burial plots?" "I thought you were sleeping?" "Not yet, so?" "It's something we've never discussed, but I think it's something we can look into." you told him turning to lay on your back "That's something you won't mind getting with me, a couple burial plot together?" you smiled although he can't see you "I won't mind it, I think it's something we should actually do. When we're both available let's talk about it, cause right now you need to be sleeping, cause you just worked a double shift." Ryan chuckled "Yes mam." you felt him pull you into his side "I love you, and it makes me love you more knowing that you would like to be buried next to me." you chuckled "And I love you. We are in this for eternity, and I wasn't joking about that." that made Ryan's heart swelled "I've come to realized that. Thank you, for being by my side." "Always." you leaned up and kissed his lips before settling back on his chest "Now go sleep, or you would be the first in that burial plot." "Yes mam." he held you tightly before you both drifted off to sleep.
