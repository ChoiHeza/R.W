            While working today Ryan came across a predicament and he needed additional help to find out some info on someone but the snooping kind of way and the only person he knew was capable of such things was Erika Sykes, so sighing deeply he hated what he had to do. He promised you he wouldn’t contact her anymore so he decided to give you a call before it back fired. Taking out his phone he searched for your name and hit call "This is Heather Wolfe." Ryan smiled at hearing your work greeting "Hey babe." "Hey you, how comes I'm hearing your voice this time of the day?" you asked pausing what you were doing and giving Ryan your attention "I'm calling you asking for permission." "For?" "I need to get some information for this kid I'm helping pertaining to the case, and the kind of information can easily be obtained by a person that's very snoopy." you chuckled "Let me guess, that person is Erika and you're calling asking for permission to contact her?" Ryan chuckled himself cause it sounded silly after you described it "Yeah, pretty much." "Babe, as sweet as this is, you really don't need to ask for permission. I trust you Ryan." "You sure?" "Yes Ryan, but thank you for thinking of me." "Always. Okay, thank you, I got to go." "Bye." "Byee." with that you hung up and shook your head, smile etching onto your face not believing that your husband actually called you and did that. You turned back to what you were working on with the smile never leaving your face.

            On his way home, Ryan only had one thought on mind and that was comfort from you after the day he just had, so entering the apartment he wasted no time in calling out for you "Beautiful, I'm home." Living room." you called back, so Ryan quickly took off his shoes and made his way to you. Entering he saw you were laying down on the sofa reading. Looking up from your book you saw his face "Someone look like they had a long day." you told him starting to sit up but he stopped you after shedding his jacket and coming to lay on top of you "You have no idea." he greeted you with a kiss before burying his face in your neck inhaling your scent, you rest down your book and moved to rub his back "You can talk about it when you're ready." you felt him nod before releasing a sigh, when you both were comfortable you picked back up your book and went back to reading and you guys stayed in that position for about thirty minutes. Ryan wasn't sleeping he was just enjoying the comfort you gave. You felt him stir coming out from your neck to rest his head on your chest "Hungry?" you asked and felt him shake his head "No, I'm not hungry." "Okay, just let me know when." and Ryan nodded. Silence fell between you two again as you went back to reading, and a moment passed before Ryan broke the silence to tell you off his day and what made it so long. Your book was down now and you were gently rubbing his back as you listened "But it's good that you didn’t get in trouble in the end." "That was a major plus but the downside was the kid and I truly wanted to help him." Ryan sighed "Well you just did your job and that's enough." you reassured him and he nodded "Thank you, for being my comfort." he said holding his head up looking at you offering a smile which you returned "Always baby." he leaned forward and placed a kiss on your lips before getting up "I'm going to shower, I encountered a bloater today." your face immediately went in disgust "And you came and laid on me the moment you came home, Ryan Wolfe you did not." you got up quickly feeling digested "Then come shower with me, problem solved." you gave him a flat stare "Was this your plan all along?" he shook his head "Actually no, but the idea just came to mind." he said with a smug look and you just rolled your eyes "I hate you." you got up walking past him, "You know you don't baby." he said laughing catching up to you and lifting you up bridal style causing you to giggle "I can always try." "You know you don't want to." he said heading in the direction of the bathroom "Yeah yeah." you said with a laugh "Bath or shower?" Ryan asked reaching the bathroom and resting you down "Shower is just fine, and no funny business." you told him with a pointed finger "But-" "No buts Ryan." he sighed feeling defeated "Fine." his facial expression caused you to laugh, but he doesn't know you'll be the one administrating the fun in the shower.
