            Ryan went into the station with hope because if he can account every case he worked on he'll get a chance to be reinstated soon as possible and that meant also getting back with you, because he misses you like crazy, your voice he hasn’t heard in weeks and your face, he just have the photos he's taken of you and those he looks at very often. So anything that came before him that he had to face in order to get you back, he'll do it. If he knew that his gambling addiction was going to lead to this, losing the job that he loved and the woman he loved he wouldn't have even thought of doing it. But the damage has been done already and all he can do now is make it better and not make the same mistakes again.

            It was the end of the day and you were a nerve wreck because you were awaiting the news after your presentation that morning, of the project that you have been working on for almost a year. "Nervous?" your co-worker Hazel asked as she rolled her chair over too you "Like you wouldn’t believe, I need to breathe." she reached across and started to rub your back "I don't know what you're so worried about, you've got this Heather, that software you created was the best thing I've ever seen and that's a definite guaranteed for the promotion. That would be super useful to the forensic lab and don't forget, no one here works as hard as you." her words were very comforting, because since you've lost Ryan as your hype man, Hazel took that place, you could say she was your work best friend. You smiled her direction "Thank you, I needed that." before she could of said anything you heard your name called "Heather Wolfe." your head snapped up nerves coming in even stronger. So quickly, you looked towards Hazel before getting up and she shot you a double thumbs and 'You got this.'. You went into the office and sat "Mrs. Wolfe, I must say, the software you created, is perfect in every way." he got into more detail and you listened and he had nothing but good things to say. "So based on the way I've spoken, I bet you can already guess what I'm going to say." a smile graced your face and he continued after standing up "Congratulations Mrs. Wolfe, you got the job." you quickly shot out your seat to shake his hands "Thank you so much sir, I've worked really hard to get this." "We can see that, and it shows, also we would like you to know that your program will be used in the Miami crime lab." your eyes widen "Really?!" and he nodded with a wide smile of his own "It would be a great deal of help to them. You are one of the best workers we have and we're very thankful to have you here with us." "Thank you so much sir, thank you." you guys shook hands once more before you were dismissed. Leaving the room, the smile would not leave your face. So closing the door, you stood there in the hallway for a while and you saw Hazel round the corner big smile on her face "So?" she asked approaching and you rapidly nodded, you both silently screamed doing little jumps and dances in the hallway "Didn't I tell you that you were going to get it, and you were worried for nothing." "I can't believe it." "You better, and I bet Ryan is going to be very happy to hear the good news." That made your smile falter a bit, because of what's happening but you quickly covered it up "Yeah, I can't wait to tell him."

            You were finished with work for the day and was making way to the car. Placing your stuff in the back seat, you got in the driver side and just sat there for a bit. Thoughts running through your head 'Ryan would be happy to know I got the job, also I wouldn't have gotten it if it wasn’t for him. He was there the whole time and he kept me going.' you were contemplating if to tell him or not. You sat there for a while thoughts going back and forth, but it's like your body decided to take control of the situation and started the car, driving off. Body still in control, you drove to your shared apartment with Ryan, it's been a really long time since you came home, and arriving at the complex, your body just immediately craved and missed the familiarity it held. So parking in your usual spot, you got out with your handbag in hand, and locked the car, heading up to the apartment. "I wonder if Ryan is home." you thought to yourself, because you don't know if he's working or what job he has or what the hours are like. Reaching the apartment door, you hesitated for a bit, because it's been so long, and you questioned if this was the right thing to do. So sighing you unlocked the door and entered "Ryan?" you decided to call out but heard nothing. You figured he wasn't home as yet so resting down your bag and taking off your shoes, you walked around the apartment, taking it in. As expected it was tidy and clean, because your husband has OCD. Walking through you just realized how much you missed this place. Entering the bedroom, you almost broke down because it's been so long since you've slept with Ryan and smelt his scent, the room was filled with it. So throat drying up and all the emotions overwhelming you, you left the bedroom and headed to the kitchen to get a bottle of water. Just as you were about to round the corner, the sight of a certain person stopped you in your tracks. "Heather." Ryan said not believing what he was seeing "Is it really you?" Ryan wasn't sure because they were times he imagined you here, you smiled and shyly waved "It's really me, sorry for barging in like this." "Why are you apologizing for, you live here. What are you doing here, I mean I'm over joyed and gosh I've missed you but just wasn't expecting to see you." Ryan could not believe his eyes, there you were, the love of his life, standing in front of him, looking as beautiful as the day he met her, if not more beautiful. "Um, I just came by to share some news." immediately Ryan's eyes widened and went downward towards your stomach "Are you..?" quickly catching on you chuckled waving your hands "No no, I'm not pregnant." sighing you continued "I got the promotion." "You got the job, even to work at the lab?" you nodded smiling hugely and Ryan filled with so much happiness closed the distance between you two lifting you up spinning you around. Not caring you wrapped your arms around him missing the feeling so much and felt the same happiness he radiated. Setting you back down, hands not leaving you "I told you, you were going to get it, didn't I tell you." you nodded smiles never leaving "You did and you believed in me when I didn’t believe in myself and without you I wouldn’t have gotten it." Ryan shook his head "That was all you, I just gave you a nudge." you laughed at that because you said the same thing to him when he got promoted to CSI. "You remembered?" "How could I forget." he said pushing a piece of hair behind your ear "That's why I stopped by, I wanted to tell you the good news, because you were there through the journey." his eyes softened "Thank you, for telling me." you guys stood there for a bit just looking at each other, because you both missed each other so much, and boy did you miss how handsome he is, and how he's dressed isn't helping, so you made sure that you're the one to break the moment "Um, I gotta go, that's all I came by to do." you said with a sad smile and Ryan's face fell "Oh, that's okay." Ryan wasn't going to argue, because he knows it's not going to help also he is nowhere near to righting his wrongs, after what happened today at the station, he might be even further. So you offered a smile, and headed to the door, putting on your shoes and then picking up your bag before turning back to Ryan. "It was really nice seeing you again." you said contemplating if to leave Ryan a kiss, but you decided to settle for a cheek kiss. So you leaned forward and placed a kiss to his cheek but he took hold of your waist and kept you there, because after that little amount of affection you showed him, he didn't realized how much he missed your touch "Please don't go." you pulled away to look at him and his eyes held you "I have to." Ryan shook his head "Please." it's the way he begged that pulled at your heart strings. You stared into his eyes and it showed how much he missed you and you know you felt the same way and the way his hands were holding you weren't helping, so finally caving you took hold of Ryan's face and smashed your lips against his. It caught Ryan off guard but he quickly composed himself and kissed you back with the same passion. Not wasting time, he lifted you up like a familiar routine and took off in the direction of the bedroom.
