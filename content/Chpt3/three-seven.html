            It was six in the morning and you were in front your computer working away on your promotional project "Good morning babe, how long were you up?" you heard Ryan's voice behind so you stopped what you were doing and turned to look at him giving a small smile "Good morning." the moment he saw your face his question was answered "You never went to sleep?" you shook your head turning fully in the chair to face Ryan and he walked his way towards you "What are you working on?" "The promotional project." Ryan looked at you with sad eyes and arms wide open, so you got up and entered his embrace. He hugged you tightly against him and your body instantly relaxed, the feeling of sleepiness hitting you. "Soon time for your shift?" you asked Ryan lifting your head to look up at him and he nodded "I'll go get breakfast ready." Ryan immediately shook his head and stopped you from leaving his brace "No no."  before you could protest Ryan lifted you up and took you to the bedroom "What are you doing?" "Taking you to bed, because you've been up all night working and you need rest." "But you need breakfast." you protested when he placed you down on the bed "I know but I can do it myself and leave for you." he gave you a look that left no room for argument "Okay." "Good." he kissed your forehead before leaving, so you allowed your body to cave and lay down, just telling yourself that you'll close your eyes for a moment till Ryan was finished with breakfast but little did you know that your body went into full sleep mode.

            Ryan finished in the kitchen and returned to the bedroom to get you for breakfast but when he returned he saw you were knocked out and a smile graced his face. So quietly approaching the bed, he placed your body properly and placed the blanket over you before placing a kiss to your forehead. "What am I going to do with you?" he asked to himself shaking his head before taking one last glance at you before heading to the bathroom to get washed up for the day. After Ryan was dressed and ate breakfast, he made sure to leave some for you and he left it with a little note, hoping that it makes your day. Softly he sat on the bed beside you "I'm leaving for work baby. I'll see you this evening, I love you." he said quietly to not wake you, and placed a lingering kiss to your temple before leaving the apartment.

            Waking up and stretching, body feeling extremely tired you looked to the clock on the bedside table and saw that it read 10:35 am. Trying to recall your morning, you remember Ryan woke up and found you working and after that you were sleeping. You didn't get to see him off this morning, or make him breakfast. Sighing you reached for your phone to message Ryan to apologize for this morning, knowing whenever he's free he'll see the message and reply. So stretching once again you got up and went to the bathroom to freshen up for the day before heading to the kitchen to get something to eat. Entering you saw breakfast was already laid out on the counter covered over and a smile made it's way to your face knowing Ryan did this, so sitting, reaching to lift off the cover a piece of paper caught your eye, taking it up you read 'Good morning beautiful, it's okay that you didn't get to see me off or make me breakfast this morning, because that meant I got to make you breakfast, so enjoy, I love you. -Your husband' the note made the smile on your face grow wider, who knew that Ryan was capable of being super sweet. Reaching for your phone to reply back to Ryan to ignore the messages you sent earlier, you saw that he was calling you "Hello you." "You're awake, no need to apologize baby, it's okay." "Yeah, I realized. I just saw the note and it was very sweet, it made my day." "Well that's what I was hoping for." "Thank you, enjoy your day today okay, and I'll see you later." "Yes mam. I love you." "And I love you." you guys hung up and you got up to heat up the breakfast.

            After Ryan ended the call a smile was tattooed on his lips knowing that you loved the gesture he made for you this morning, little did he know that Natalia was watching him in a distance a smile gracing her lips as well "Who was that, your girlfriend?" Natalia asked approaching Ryan and the question caught him off guard "What, no. Not my girlfriend." he said trying his best to take away his smile and he wasn't lying when he said 'no' because technically you're his wife. Before Natalia had time to pry more, Ryan started working back on the case asking her a question.

            Before you know it, it was time for Ryan to soon come home, so you made sure dinner was made, before you turned back to your work. "Hey baby, I'm home." a smile instantaneously graced your face when you heard his voice, making you get up to greet him. "Hi." when he came into view you approached with outstretched arms wasting no time in connecting your bodies together. "Someone missed me today." you heard Ryan chuckle "You have no idea." you squeezed him once more before pulling away and resting your hands on his cheeks, pulling his face towards your encasing both your lips in a lovely kiss, you felt Ryan hummed into the kiss before you pulled away "These are my favourite kind of kisses." Ryan said making you chuckle. You pulled away and took a good look at Ryan to see how he was dressed for the day, and let's just say you loved what you saw "Babe, I love the fit. These pants fits you nice." he looked down at himself with a smile "I do try my best to dress good for you, and I wish I could say the same about your pants." he reached down to hem of his t shirt that you were wearing to lift to see if in fact you weren't wearing any pants "No peeking. I just didnâ€™t feel like wearing any." you smacked his hand away "What do you mean no peeking?" he asked as you pulled away from him heading in the direction of the kitchen "Exactly what it means. Are you hungry, I've already cooked dinner?" you asked stopping turning back to look at him "I am hungry but not for dinner just yet." you knew exactly what he meant and before you asked a chance to run away Ryan already had you captured in his arms "No fair, you're bigger than me." Ryan just shrugged his shoulders "I thought you liked that." you rolled your eyes and turned in his arms "I guess it's okay or whatever." "Oh shush." Ryan said before crashing his lips against yours and you accepted raising up to wrap your legs around his waist.
