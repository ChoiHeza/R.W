            Ryan was picking you up from work this evening because you guys had some couple errands to run. When Ryan arrived outside your work place he messaged letting you know he was there, so you decided to give him a call "Hey babe, something wrong?" you heard him say into the phone "No, I just need your help with some boxes that I have to take home." "Okay, I'm coming." with that Ryan hung up and got out the car making his way to your office. Reached your floor he saw the receptionist was already gone so he just went straight to your office floor door. He saw you were outside waiting to let him in, cause you need badge access to enter. "Hey baby, thanks for coming." you greeted with a bright smile when he approached you "It's nothing." he smiled back and gave you a forehead kiss. "Okay come on." you gestured for him to follow you through the door and he greeted the only three others that remained. "Ryan, long time no see." Brady said greeting Ryan with a handshake "Hey Brady, how have you been?" they talked for a bit as you went to your desk starting to get the boxes that Ryan would help you with. It wasn't long before Ryan joined you "These boxes right here, is what I need my strong husband to carry for me." you said slapping your hand on a pile of boxes, that caused Ryan to chuckle "Look at me being the strong husband." he bent to lift the boxes, and you took one from him to help but he stopped you "No no, let me do this, I got it." you raised your hand in defense "Why thank you babe, just let me get my things then." with that you got your bags and you both told everyone a bye "Let's go." Ryan followed you out as you held open the doors for him. You guys made it to the car "The keys are in my pocket" Ryan told you "Which one?" "Front left." you reached in and took out the keys, pressing the unlock button. You went to the trunk and opened the door for Ryan, then he placed down the boxes closing the door himself. You gave him the keys and you both got in the car. "So where to first?" Ryan asked starting the car "We could go to the bank first, then the meat shop and supermarket for last." "Yes mam." Ryan said with a nod and drove off.

            After running all the errands, you guys arrived home with so much luggage "This is like what, two to three trips?" you said as you both stood in front the trunk looking at the items "Then I say we get started.". It took you two trips while Ryan went for three, so you held the apartment door open as he brought in the last set of items "That's everything." he said coming in and resting them on the kitchen counter. "Good, I'll start putting them away."  "What about your boxes?" Ryan asked as he took off his shoes "Could you rest them in the office area please." "Sure." "Thanks babe." you started to put away the stuff in the kitchen while Ryan moved your boxes for you. "So what's in the boxes?" Ryan asked joining you in the kitchen to help "Those are for my promotion to team lead, and I need to create something amazing that's going to put me there." Ryan looked up at you amazed "You're aiming for a promotion?" you chuckled nodding "I am, would be nice to make manager one day." a huge smile appeared on Ryan's face "I'm really impressed babe." "But I haven't gotten it yet." "So, I just know you will get it, because I have that much faith in you." Ryan paused what he was doing to place a kiss to your temple "Thank you, that really means a lot coming from you." you offered him a smile "So does the project have to do anything with the lab?" Ryan asked continuing what he was doing and you nodded "That's my department, and the position I'm aiming for, leads the projects of things built that is used in your labs at work." Ryan's smile started to grow "So that means, that I would get to see you at work?" he asked with a raised brow, stopping coming in front of you and your smile drew to match his "Yes sir, you would get to see me, but that's only if I get the promotion." you reassured him resting your hands on his shoulders and he brought his to your waist "You already have it baby, it was meant to be, come on." that made you chuckled "I guess our lives were definitely meant to intertwine with each other's." Ryan smiled down at you, raising a hand to tuck some hair behind your ears then resting his hand on the back of your neck "I think some people call that soulmates." "You believe in soulmates?" you asked with a raised brow "I didn't but, after I met you I started believing in a lot of things, I guess you can say that you make me see the magic in this world." you tried hard not to laugh "Come on Ryan, really now? This doesnâ€™t sound like you." you shook your head and he shrugged his shoulders "What can I say, you bring out sides in me that I didn't know I had." that truly made you smile, so you tiptoed and connected your lips with his, "I guess I can say the same thing happens with me." he smiled down at you and brought his other hand up to your face "You know that I love you right, Mrs. Wolfe." your eyes beamed at him "I know you do Mr. Wolfe, and I hope you know that I love you." his facial expression matched yours "I mean, you wear green constantly. Like right now for example." you said gesturing to his sweater and that made Ryan chuckle "Well, this was only because I saw you put on a green shirt this morning, and I knew we were going to be running errands together this evening, so I wanted to match." you gasped "You Ryan Wolfe, wanted to be the couple that matches, damn." he rolled his eyes at you "Don't act so surprised, you already know this." you laughed "I know but I love teasing you." you leaned up and pecked his lips before stepping out his arms. "You're lucky I love you." Ryan said and that made you turn over your shoulder to throw a wink and blow of a kiss his way, and he just shook his head going back to putting away the items.
