            Ryan came home to find you wrapped up in a blanket, with popcorn in hand and watching a movie. "What did I walk into?" His voice made you look away from the tv and towards him "I am currently having myself a Lord of The Rings marathon." Ryan eyes widened at the realization "So that means you've been watching from since this morning?" you nodded pausing the movie turning towards him "The moment you left this morning." you chuckled to yourself "I see the dedication is real." Ryan said coming to sit next to you "It is my favourite franchise for a reason." "So that means I'm going to seem like the bad guy when I ask this question." "What question?" "Did you forget about our dinner reservations tonight?" your eyes widened because you did in fact forget and Ryan chuckled at that "Oh my, Ryan baby I'm so sorry, but don't worry, nothing has changed." "So you're telling me that you can stop watching Lord of The Rings and go to dinner with me, because not once have I ever seen you stop watching this movie for anything." you did a shy smile because that was in fact true "Well, I guess that is about to change. My husband made dinner reservations and it would make that way more important than these movies." your body was fully turned towards him and that made Ryan's features soften because he knows how much you love these movies "Really babe?" you nodded "Really." you smiled and Ryan leaned forward to give you a kiss because that made him happy "So shall we go and get ready?" you nodded wasting no time in getting up pulling Ryan along with you "Yes sir."

            As always Ryan was always first to finish dress, and was currently on the bed sitting, on his phone waiting till you were finished. You were in the bathroom putting the last touches to your face, putting on the lipstick, a personal favourite shade of Ryan's. When finished you did a once over in the mirror to make sure everything was perfect. Once you found no faults you left the bathroom entering the bedroom heading over to the shoe rack. Picking out your silver heels, you headed toward Ryan for him to help you put them on. Coming to stand in front of him you placed the shoes down with a thud and that caught Ryan's attention making him look away from his phone over to you. His eyes started at your feet and raked their way up your body "Ryan." you called his name which made his eyes jump to yours and he hummed "Finish?" and he shook his head but you rolled your eyes giggling "I need help with my shoes, could you be a dear?" you said gesturing to the shoes and Ryan nodded "Left first." he slipped it on and buckled for you then moved to the right. He made sure to touch you as much as possible and it only continued when he finished buckling the right shoe, that he dragged his hand from your ankle to calf then the back of your knee, but you halted his movements before he went further by heading over to the dresser "If you continue that, we're never going to leave home." "But isn't that the point." he raised a brow at you as he leaned back resting on his hands as he watched you and you turned back to give him a look "Not when reservations are made." and Ryan sighed "Not even when my wife looks incredibly gorgeous and sexy." he smirked with a raised brow and you shook your head "Nice try babe." after applying your finishing touches you went to look in the full length mirror for a once over. "What do you think?" you asked Ryan looking at yourself, he was quiet and you were about to turn to him but he appeared behind you in the mirror "As always babe, you take my breath away." you giggled at the corny line from Ryan "What?" you shook your head "Tell me." he said resting his left hand on your hip "I just found the line corny." you said trying to hide your smile and Ryan rolled his eyes and with a squeezed of your hip he walked away from you "Come on babe. It was still sweet none the less." you said but he refused to turn so you approached him wrapping your arms around him from behind "Thank you for the compliment and you do take my breath away as well, way more than you know." Ryan's brow raised at that and he turned in your arms looking down at you "Really?" he asked and you nodded "Like right now for example." you said running your hands along the front of his jacket and Ryan's hands grasped your hips "Is it enough to make us stay home?" you tilted your head at that "Ryan, do you really not feel like going?" "I do but you just look so fine." his hands were rubbing your hips now "But I don't want this lipstick to go to waste." you said with a little pout and Ryan's knees weakened and you swore you heard him moan "What are you waiting for baby, let's go have dinner." he kiss your forehead and took hold of your hand leading you out the bedroom. When you both reached the apartment door, Ryan got his keys and had the door open ready to leave but you halted him "What’s wrong?" not answering, you opened the top button of his shirt and placed an open mouth kiss on his chest leaving a lipstick mark behind "The tiniest preview for what's to come." you said smiling up at him and he looked at you "Come on babe, don't make me take you right here." you winked buttoning back up his shirt and throwing a wink his way "Let’s go." you said with a tap to his chest and you were out the door starting to make your way down the hallway. It wasn't long before Ryan was next to you with his hand at the small of your back "Gosh I love you." he said placing a kiss to your temple as you guys head off to dinner.
