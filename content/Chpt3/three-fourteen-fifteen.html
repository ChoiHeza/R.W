            Let's just say, both you and Ryan had a very very long and busy day. Not knowing about each other's day, you just wanted to get home and share a bath with your loving husband but you were in for a different surprise when you got there. Coming in through the door you saw that Ryan's shoes were there and was very thankful for that "Hey hun, I'm home." you said quickly taking off your shoes and resting down your bags, making your way to Ryan. But rounding the corner you saw he was pacing in the living room looking very upset "Where were you?" he asked catching you off guard "Work, I just got off." you said halting your steps standing in place "Then why weren't answering your phone?" there was still annoyance in his voice "Because it died, I had to use it a lot today and forgot to travel with my charger." sighing, Ryan started to rub his face "I'm sorry but am I missing something, are you mad at me, just for missing a call?" you were so confused and Ryan realizing how he came across made him see why you thought that, so he immediately closed the distance between you two and brought you into his embrace "I'm sorry baby, today was just an awful day, I didn’t mean to snap at you. I just became really worried when I didn’t hear from you." sensing something is really wrong, you pulled away enough to look up at him "What's wrong Ryan?" you took his face between your hands waiting for his reply "Delko got shot today, and he's in the hospital not doing too well." your eyes widened and hands immediately went to your mouth. Hearing this news hurt, because you and Eric have managed to gotten closer since meeting. You would sometimes hang out with him and Ryan when they went drinking after a shift. Instantaneously going into action, you pulled away from Ryan and started heading for the door "What are you doing babe?" "We're going to the hospital." the moment the words left your lips Ryan joined you and it wasn't long before you both were out the door.

            The moment your eyes landed on Eric tears came to your eyes threatening to spill seeing the condition he was in. He was currently asleep and you were very thankful for that cause you don’t think your heart could handle the situation he was in. Ryan was with you there in the room standing beside you resting a comforting hand on your lower back. "He's going to be okay right?" you asked Ryan quietly not taking your eyes from Eric. "Yeah, the doctors said it'll take time but he's going to be okay." after hearing that, you moved closer wiping your eyes and took a seat in the chair next to his bed and took hold of his hand and reached back your other hand for Ryan to take "I want to pray for him." nodding, Ryan's hand entered yours and you both closed your eyes as you prayed for him. After spending a little more time you both left to join back H outside because he was the only one there when you guys first arrived, and was surprised to see that he was joined with someone else, it was a blonde woman, about the same height as you, maybe a little taller. You saw her and H were talking before they caught you and Ryan leaving the room. H was the first to speak "Is he still sleeping?" and Ryan nodded "Okay, I'll go in for a little while and say my goodbyes, there's something that came up." you and Ryan nodded before H passed you both entering the room. With the three of you left the blonde was the first to speak "Ryan, aren’t you going to introduce me to this gorgeous lady beside you." the blonde said with the brightest smile she could muster "Oh right, sorry, Calleigh this is my wife Heather and Heather this is Calleigh. You guys know of each other just never got a chance to meet" she had her hand outstretched which you gladly took "Hi! It's nice to finally meet you, wish it was under better circumstances" she said "Same here and I am sorry to hear what happened. I was surprised when Ryan told me the news." she nodded "I know you guys are close, I hear him mention you from time to time or hear when both him and Ryan are talking about you." you looked surprised "I hope all good things." you said looking to Ryan ready to give him an eye but Calleigh reassured you "Don't worry, it's all good things, but what I am upset about is not being able to meet you sooner." you offered her a sad smile and explained to her that Ryan was going to introduce you to the team but then after the incident with Marisol he figured it wouldn’t have been best, just for your safety and she completely understood and agreed with Ryan on that one. "After all it is a dangerous line of work that we're in." you could tell her words held a bit of double meaning behind them. It wasn't long before H exited the room "It was nice seeing you once again Heather." H told you, and you guys shared a parting hug before he told the rest that he'll see them tomorrow "I'm going to go in now, once again it was amazing meeting the infamous Mrs. Wolfe, let's not make it the last time we meet." you chuckled and nodded "Same here and I will make sure it isn't" you guys hugged and said your byes before she disappeared into Eric's room. Ryan turned to you taking your other hand into his hold because his fingers were intertwined with yours the whole time "Ready to go?" and you nodded releasing a yawn making Ryan chuckle.

            You guys decided to stop at a diner for some take out before heading home. So entering the apartment, you both took off your shoes and Ryan shed his jacket before heading to the kitchen to get some glasses "Living room?" you asked and Ryan nodded, so you took the take out in hand and headed for the living room. Setting the bag down, you sat down on the bag before sitting on the carpet and unpacking it. Ryan finally came into the living room with two glasses of water in hand. "You don't know how hungry you are until you see food." Ryan said chuckling before sitting next to you on the carpet. You both wasted no time in digging in. With most of the food devoured you decided to ask Ryan "Minus Eric, how was your day?" that caused Ryan to release a huge sigh "Still awful. A bunch of guns were stolen and because fo the result of that, I had to work a case where an eleven year old boy was killed." your heart sunk at that "Who did it?" "It was his brother. He found the gun and was playing with it, was a complete accident, so I talked to him and reassured him that he's not going to jail for it." "That's honestly really sad, but that was sweet of you, for settling that boys' heart." you offered him a smile. "But you know what really pissed me off about that case?" "What?" "The boy's father saw his son dead, on the lawn, and didn’t even spare him a glance or stuck around. When he heard the shot, he made sure to get out of there quickly because he didn’t want the death pinned on him. Could you believe that?" you were in disbelief "Please tell me he got in trouble for that?" Ryan nodded "He did thankfully, but you wouldn't believe that the next case also involved kids, these ones weren't dead but being used illegally for cutting diamonds." "Wait what?" "This woman that owns a jewelry store, she has a room in the back where she keeps the kids and gets them to cut the diamonds for her." you just shook your head "What is wrong with the world? Who in their right mind does something like that. That's messed up." Ryan agreed "That reminds me, could you lend me your wedding ring tomorrow, I want to get it checked out, just to make sure the diamond was made legally." you gasped staring at your hand "Oh my goodness, the thought didn't even cross my mind." the thought crossing more through your mind, you took off the ring and gave it to Ryan "I can't even wear this knowing the thought of what might be." and Ryan chuckled "I highly doubt it but I will definitely get it looked at. So you aren't going to wear it till then?" you shook your head,  "I just only wear the band for now. It feels weird though." "Don't worry, I will have it returned to its rightful owner in no time." "Thank you." you guys finished ate before heading off to shower.

            "My body is so tired." Ryan said crashing on the bed the moment he came out the bathroom "Not while your skin is damp Ryan." you said nudging him with your foot because you were currently on the bed already clean "No. I'm staying right here and sleeping." "Fine, be like that. Then I'll sleep outside." you said starting to get up but Ryan beat you too it "Fine, I'll get dry and dressed." "Good." Ryan wasted no time in getting up and quickly dried his skin before putting on a pants and coming back to bed, but this time laying properly beside you "Time to stop reading now." Ryan said as he turned to you laying on his side "Let me just finish this chapter, I'm soon there." Ryan hummed a reply and watched you as you read. When you reached the end, you closed the book with a "Finish". After resting it on your night stand you turned to see Ryan was looking at you, so you matched his position looking back at him "What's going through your head?" you asked him "Several thoughts all at once." "And what's the most played over one?" there was a pause before Ryan replied "Eric." with that one word you could somewhat imagine what was going through his mind "Tough day, but, by God's grace he's still with us and you guys got the guy responsible." Ryan smiled a bit at that "You're right and I shouldn't dwell on the what ifs." "You shouldn't. You're learning." you sent a smile his way and he chuckled "Well, I learnt from the best." with that he leaned forward and placed a quick kiss to your lips "I love you." he said against your lips "And I love you." you replied back deepening the kiss for a second before you both pulled away "Ready to sleep?" you asked and Ryan nodded before yawning. With that you turned and switched off your lamp encasing the room in darkness, and it wasn't long before Ryan pulled himself towards you making you the big spoon. "Goodnight beautiful." Ryan said and you replied with one of your own and a kiss to his forehead. Tonight Ryan is the one that's seeking your comfort after the tremendous day he's had.
