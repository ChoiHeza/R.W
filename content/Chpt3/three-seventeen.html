            "You know what's something I've realized while living in Miami?" you said while putting away the laundry in the closet "What's that?" Ryan asked while putting away the folded clothes in drawers "That you people love to wear white." that made Ryan pause for a moment to think "You're right you know, we do wear a lot of white." "Exactly, hence the amount of white jackets you own." "I guess that's a Miami subconscious thing." before you hung up the white jacket that Ryan wore today, you tried it on "What are you doing beautiful?" Ryan asked when he saw you "I want to see what's the hype." with the jacket on, you went in front the full length mirror and did a couple poses "I'm not feeling it." you said inspecting yourself "Maybe that's because the jacket swallows you." Ryan chuckled "Maybe. I guess the next time I go shopping I should try on one my size." you said taking off the jacket now to hang it up "And when will that be?" Ryan asked putting the last article of clothing away "Probably my next off day." Ryan immediately protested "No, I will not allow it." "Why not, do I need permission from you now to go shopping?" Ryan shook his head "Not what I was aiming for. I meant I would like to go when you're going, and watch you try on clothes." you threw slit eyes his way "You want to go shopping with me, and watch me try on plenty of clothes?" Ryan nodded "You don't remember the last time we went together right?" "I do remember, yeah, I got tired but I did enjoy myself and I loved helping you pick out clothes." "So you're sure you really want to come and will not complain at all?" "Yes I really want to come, and I promise I wonâ€™t complain." "Okay, I'll hold you too that Mr. Wolfe, and we'll go on your next off day." a wide smile made its way to Ryan's face "Thank you." "Okay pervert. Finish hang up these clothes while I go and get started on dinner." Ryan chuckled "Yes mam." you gasped "He didn't even deny it. I knew it." you said exiting the bedroom quickly before Ryan had a chance to defend himself "I'm not!" you heard him shout from within but you were already gone.

            "Who would of thought vanilla jelly would get the job done." Ryan was telling you about today's case as you guys were eating dinner "And this was in the everglades right?" Ryan nodded "The same place you wanted to take me, what was it last year, year before?" Ryan chuckled "I get your point babe, it's very dangerous, and don't worry, I'll keep you from there." "Good boy." that made Ryan chuckle "But that sucks though, coming for a vacation and everything just going wrong. Would not like to be those guys." Ryan agreed "But that makes me think, it's been a while since we've travelled. The last time was our honeymoon and that's almost three years now." "You're right, next vacation want to go somewhere?" "That would be nice. When we're available let's think of a place." "Sounds perfect." you said and with that you both continued eating.
