            You didn’t had to go into work early today so you were currently in an arm chair with laptop in hand working on the project. The tv on in the background with the news playing, but you were paying no attention to it, that was until a very familiar voice caught your attention. Looking up to confirm, you saw it was in fact your husband that you haven't seen or heard from in a good while. You saw that he was a reporter of sorts. "I see you're really working instead of gambling." you said with a chuckle. You were definitely surprised to see him, so looking at the tv you watched for a bit "Ryan, I know you would make stupid decisions without me." he was talking about the case, and identifying a man which you saw wasn't very smart of him. So sighing you switched the channel and turned back to your laptop.

            When he first got the job he was surprised to find out the reporters name was Heather, he felt like God was punishing him but he just ignored it and got the job done. After his segment, Ryan hope you had saw it to see that he was making a change, that he was trying cause he still couldn't contact you, not until everything was fixed. But he wanted you to see that he was trying. He called in Calleigh because he received several information that may be useful. She arrived and scolded him letting him know what he did was very wrong and how he went about doing it, sighing, Ryan replied "I know, but I didn't mean to hurt anyone." "Well you didn't clearly think that through." Calleigh said then you crossed her mind "Even your wife Ryan, how did you not think that was going to hurt her." Ryan eyes widened "How do you know about that, did you see her?" Calleigh's eyes soften and she nodded "I did, at the bank this week." "How is she doing?" Calleigh raised a brow in confusion "She left me when I told her what happened, the day I got fired, she said to get my life together and right my wrongs before bringing her back into my life, and that's what I'm trying to do." Calleigh sighed, her heart hurt for you, knowing you're a victim in all of this as well, you were in the dark just like them "Well Ryan, I don’t think this is the way to do it." "I got bills to pay." "I get that, but trust me, they are better ways to do that. Look I gotta go, bye." with that she quickly left, he pondered on her words about the job he was doing.

            After going about his day Ryan realized that this wasn't the way to get back into the good books, so he quit. After he left he met up with H and he told Ryan about what he did was pretty bad, aiding a felon, and it won't go away anytime soon, he may not even get back his job "I know H, and I'll pay for it but I must ask for a favour." "I'm listening." "Heather, when she gets the promotion to work with CSI, don't let what I did hinder her or stop her from getting the job, because she has worked really hard for the position, and when people see the last name they'll ask questions, but I don’t want my reputation to fall on her, because she knew nothing of my gambling, she is completely innocent in all of it. So please, don’t let anything bad happen." Ryan was practically begging H for you, although you weren't with him right now, he still madly loved and cared for you and didn’t want his mistakes effect you cause he would hate himself even more. H smiled at that "Don't worry Ryan, I'll make she gets in with no problem and I'll look out for her. Trust me on that." Ryan's heart soften "Thank you H." he offered him a smile, and they talked some more about Ryan's situation before parting.

            You're at work, working so hard cause the promotion was coming up and you wanted it so bad, and you're going to make sure it's you that gets it. Yeah Ryan may not be a CSI anymore but that's not going to stop you cause a part of you hopes that he gets back his job there. A thought that crossed your mind was that because of Ryan's mistake you hoped it didn't stop you from getting the job because you carry his name and married to him, cause you worked to hard for this to be taken from you. You have never prayed so hard, so you're hoping God's got you covered.
