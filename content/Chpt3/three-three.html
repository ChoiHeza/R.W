            Ryan came home that evening later than usual but he didn't remember to contact you "Hey baby, sorry for being late." you heard Ryan said entering the apartment "Hey hun." you were in the kitchen "Case carried on late?" you asked when you saw him enter the kitchen. He took off his jacket before replying "Sort of." you looked up from the vegetables you were chopping to greet Ryan but the look on his face worried you "What's wrong?" you asked stopping what you were doing and coming to him "I've been having a long conversation with myself on the way home, resulting in us needing to talk." he sighed and you felt your heart drop, so you nodded "Okay." you said slowly and followed Ryan to the sofa, you both sat down turning to face each other. "Okay, I'm listening." he took his hands in yours before speaking "You remember the tablet I got Calleigh to buy for my niece?" you nodded "Well, when I paid her back, it turns out that the money I paid her back with was counterfeit." you nodded slowly trying to understand "And how did you manage to get that, was it from me?" he shook his head "No, you're clean, it was me." he sighed and lowered his head before continuing "You remember the night when I hung out with Mark?" "Yeah." "Well that night he asked if I would be interested in making some extra cash, and I heard him out and he told me of a death pool." with that you gave him a look of confusion "What is that?" you asked and Ryan sighed before explaining to you and you weren't believing what you were hearing, so with a shake of your head you asked "Please tell me you didn't participate in that?" Ryan looked up at you with apologetic eyes "Ryan Wolfe, you did not bet on people's lives." you were dissapointed and furious so you stood up from the sofa "I did it indirectly. I just gave him some money and it paid out, I wasn't expecting it to." you could not comprehend what you were hearing right now "I just, I don't, I don’t know what to say." you were starting to pace now "You said you were done with gambling and I believed you. What happened with asking me for money to help you?" you stood still now with your hands on your hips staring down at him "I know I was wrong, but I just took the risk, plus it makes me feel awful asking you for money." he stood up before continuing "Babe, I am sorry, but it was a relapse. Just a little one." you raised your hands to stop him from speaking "This time Ryan, I really don't want to hear it." you moved away from him "Where are you going?" he asked following after you "Away from here, because honestly I can’t even look at you right now." you took up your purse and keys before heading to the door "So you're leaving?" "Yes I'm leaving, because if I stay here I am going to tell you the worst of words." you put on your shoes and was about to open the door when Ryan took hold of your arm "Please don't go." "Right now, you don't have the right to tell me what to do." you gave him a hard stare and he sighed before releasing your arm, and you were out the door before you gave him a chance to tell you anything else.

            When you left the apartment you honestly wanted to be by yourself and to be alone with your thoughts, so you decided to take a walk to the nearest park and walked around for a bit trying to clear your head. Getting tired walking you took a seat on a swing, gently pushing yourself enjoying the movement. It was helping with your thoughts, putting them into place. You just couldn't believe Ryan did that, you wouldn't have been that mad if it was just normal gambling but the fact that it was on a death pool, that made you furious. Betting on people lives, hoping they die so you can make money, that's just wrong, and of all things you couldn't believe the man you married did something like that, yeah he said it was indirectly, but still, it was so wrong. You continued to swing, mind swirling on the words he told you. At home Ryan was devasted and instantly regretted what he did, but what really hurt was the way you talked to him and the angry and pain you had on your face. He's never seen it before, and the fact that it was him that caused it, he hated himself so much this moment. He still couldn't believe you left, it's been two hours now and it's very dark out. Although he knows you're very angry at him right now, he wanted to make sure that you're okay, so getting his keys and putting on his shoes he left the apartment to look for you.

            You didn’t know this but the necklace that Ryan gave you for your birthday, he placed a tracker in it, maybe you would be angry at him for doing that, but he just did it in case something happened to you because of the job title that he carries. That would be one argument that he would stand behind if it ever happened because your safety is his top priority, but right now, he wasn't helping with it. When he got in his car he pulled out his phone and checked the tracker and saw that you were six minutes away by car at the closest park, and his heart sank at the amount of walking you must have done to get there. He decided instead of showing up empty handed, he stopped by for a peace offering of ice cream. Parking his car he looked around for you and saw you were sitting on a set of swings, slowly moving with your head down. Not deciding to get out yet, he kept an eye out just to make sure you were safe. The more you swung the clearer your head became and tried to understood Ryan and why he did it, you were seeing it slowly but just couldn't get past the part of how wrong it still was. The anger lessened and was just replaced with disappointment, you can forgive him, but it's going to take a little time because honestly he could have gone and done so much worse, like cheat on you or something. Sighing you looked up at the sky and decided it was time to go home and talk to Ryan.

            Ryan got tired sitting in the car so he got out and leaned against it still keeping an eye on you. Ready to leave, you got up and brushed off the back of your pants. Adjusting your bag strap, you turned to leave the park but stopped when eyes met yours. Ryan stood there leaning against his car looking directly at you, when he saw you move, he pushed himself off the car but remained with his feet grounded. Sighing you slowly made your way towards him "What are you doing here?" you asked standing in front of him but not too close "Just making sure you're safe." you hmm with a nod and looked down at your feet not wanting to meet Ryans' eyes. You heard him sighed before speaking "Heather, I know I can't take back wha-" you paused him "Ryan, let's not, I just want to go home." he tightened his lips before nodding. You started to walk away heading the direction you came to get here "What are you doing Heather?" "I'm walking home." you looked up at him with eyes leaving him with no room for argument but he still pleaded anyways "Babe please, at least let me take you home, so that I would know that you're safe." you sighed knowing Ryan isn't going to give up "Fine." you turned back and got into the car, heart feeling a little lighter. Ryan may have his ways but he's still a gentleman at heart. When you were both in and before driving off Ryan turned to you "I bought you ice cream." he said gesturing to the cup holder, so you looked before looking at him "This is your way of apologizing?" you asked with a raised brow "Cause thi-" "I know, it's not near to what I've done, I just wanted to get you some." he said cutting you off and you looked back at it then him. You do have a weak spot for ice cream so caving you took it up and began to ate as Ryan drove off. Ryan was smiling on the inside at the fact that you accepted the ice cream and not threw it at him.

            Getting home, with the ice cream finished and how Ryan acted allowed you to think some more and you told him how you felt, and he agreed with everything promising to make it up to you in multiple ways. You guys both talked and cleared the air, and Ryan explained himself, so that helped and you are close to forgiving him, just not yet. "That means you're sleeping on the couch." you told him before disappearing into the bedroom "But, this would be the first time we haven't slept together in three four years." you turned to look at him "Then you should of thought about that before participating in a death pool." you gave a raised brow before turning back and Ryan sighed. 'You're right, that's fair.' Ryan thought "Yes mam." That night you both slept separately but you reassured him that you aren't mad anymore and you still loved him. He begged for a good night kiss but you caved and told him only the cheek. Going forward from that night, Ryan had been doing everything in his power to make it up to you and righting his wrong, eventually you forgive him and he promised not to do it again knowing the consequences now, because not only was it hurting him but it was hurting you as well, and that's not something he wants happening to you again after seeing how it affected you because that hurt. He did promise to be an amazing husband to you and he haven't been doing that so he needs to change to be that person for you.
