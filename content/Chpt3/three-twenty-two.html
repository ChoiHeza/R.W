            Ryan was faced with many challenges today and his past catching up on him. The problem was that he promised you he was finished with gambling but he still did it anyway in secret but that caught up to him. The guy came asking for money and he couldn’t ask you to help because you didn’t know he went behind your back and gambled, playing a game of poker. So he had to find a quick way to get the money that wasn't you so he went and gambled to raise the money. He got the money and paid it off but what he didn't know was that the guy was being followed. H found out about it and confronted him but he lied and said it had nothing to do with gambling and the worst happened, that caused him to get fired. Ryan just couldn't believe what happened, but he had no one to blame but himself. Although losing his job hurt like hell because he didn’t see it coming, he knows telling you the truth is going to hurt more because he's afraid that the worst is going to happen, you'll leave him.

            Coming home Ryan stopped for flowers hoping they'll help but deep down he already knows they're not. You were home before Ryan as usual and you were on the couch reading a book just winding down your day waiting for you husband to get home. "Hey hun." you heard Ryan's voice and wasted no time in getting up to meet him "Hey baby, welcome home." you said cheerily heading his direction. When he came into view, you saw he wore a somber smile and a bouquet in hand so you chuckled "What did you do this time?" the look on his face was serious and that really worried you "Ryan, what happened?" he gave you the flowers and you took them before listening to his explanation "I got fired today." your eyes widened in shock "What, why?" a part of you felt like you weren't going to like his answer. "Because of something I did." you nodded to show you were listening and he explained everything, making sure to leave out nothing this time. After listening there was so much emotions going through your mind, but the most prominent one was anger and disappointment, your heart was hurting and heavy "Babe please say something." he watched your face and all he could see was anger, there was so much you wanted to say and yet nothing at all because you got tired saying it all. You still remained quiet still not knowing how to approach this "Please say something, your silence in killing me." that made you snap your head towards him "My silence is killing you, what about you bloody lying to me, and breaking a promise that you imprinted on me that you'll never do again, don't you think that shit isn't killing me right now." This is the first time Ryan ever saw you so pissed off "I'm sorry." that made you laugh, Ryan was now scared "He says he's sorry, he bought me flowers and said he's sorry." you continued laughing because you were just so angry "Babe." you looked at him "Don't call me that, and these flowers, you can shove them down your lying throat." you said throwing the flowers back at him. This was the first time Ryan ever heard you spoke this way to him, he honestly had no idea what to say. "So now you have nothing to say?" Ryan was stumped "Cool." you said and walked off making a beeline to the bedroom leaving him standing there. Entering the bedroom, you went into the closet retrieving your suitcase, and started pack some clothes and important things you'll need "What are you doing?" Ryan said entering the bedroom "You have nothing to say, so I have nothing to say." you replied back not once stopping what you're doing "You're leaving?" "Very observant you are." you said sarcastically "Please stop Heather." "Give me one good reason why I should?" you paused, turning to him "Because we can work through this." and you shook your head "No, I'm done with this, it's your turn to work through it." you said approaching him "What do you mean?" "Get it together Ryan or you're going to ruin this marriage, because I'm not going to stay in a house with someone, who lies, breaks my trust and goes back on their word." you said shoving a finger in his chest before going back to packing. Ryan was left stumped again because he knows there's nothing he can say that's going to change your mind, so all he could do was watch you at the moment. With everything packed from the bedroom and bathroom that you think you'll need for the time being, you took out your duffle bag and went to leave the bedroom, but Ryan blocked the doorway "Please don't do this Heather, think it through." "Trust me when I say this Ryan, I am thinking very clearly, and I've done thought it through. So move." he shook his head "I'm not letting you leave me." "Then you should of thought of that before you hurt me." you glared at him, and Ryan could see the pain at the back of your eyes "Please Heather, don’t leave." Ryan was begging at this point and it hurt your heart "I swear Ryan, if you don't move, you're going to make things worse for yourself." sighing not wanting to make you more angry, he moved, and you shoved passed him to pack the remainder of your things that'll you need from around the rest of the apartment. Once finished, you got your suitcase from the bedroom placing the duffle bag on top, you pulled them behind you, leaving the bedroom, heading for the apartment door. Ryan tried to plead one more time "Please." he was holding onto your arm at this point and you ripped it from his hand "Don't touch me Ryan, you've lost that privilege." standing by the door you quickly put on your shoes and stood back up facing Ryan, there was just hurt and pain written all over his face, slowly you lifted your hand to look at your wedding band that connected both you and Ryan. You were contemplating if you take it off and leave it with him but you weren't divorcing him at the moment, you just wanted him to get his act together. Ryan watched and he saw the decision flashed across your face if to take it off or leave it and he prayed it was the latter. After some more thought, you decided to leave it on for now, because you don't hate him, and still loved him, just hurt. So sighing you dropped your hand back to the suitcase handle and looked at Ryan. He released a breathe he didn't know that he was holding. "Ryan, please get your act together and only contact me when you've truly changed, not before because I won't listen. Change your ways, truly change, and when this disgusting habit is behind you then we'll talk, but if that seems to be too hard for you and you care more about gambling than me, this marriage will have to end. If you love me so much as you always say, stop and change. Got it?" he nodded "I promise, I'll change." you scoffed and rolled your eyes "Like I haven't heard that before." "I mean it this time." "I'll believe it when I see it." with that you turned to leave but Ryan called out "Where are you going?" he asked and you shrugged, giving him one last look "Goodbye Ryan, take care of yourself." and like that you were out the door and gone. The moment you left Ryan broke down in front the door falling to his knees. He was beating himself up because he just lost his job, then you, and he had no one else to blame but himself. Knowing the seriousness of the situation, Ryan knows he can't play around this time, because he loves you too much to lose you for good. He did one thing that he said he would never do, he took you for granted and look where it got him now, alone and jobless. This is the lowest he's ever felt in his life, and usually with this feeling he would go and gamble but that's what got him here in the first place. For once he was lost and didn't know what to do.

            That night you decided to spend it in a hotel and tomorrow you'll look for somewhere to rent for the time being because you know it's going to take a while before Ryan gets back on his feet and fixes everything and there was no way you were going to let him back into your life that easy. He should be lucky that you didn’t take off the ring and threw it at him. You'll be patient and wait to see what he does, because knowing Ryan, he knows how serious it is now, and will do everything he can to get you back and make things right. That's what you were hoping for, because deep down you're going to miss him like crazy and these next few months to come aren't going to be easy. Sighing you flopped down on the bed of the hotel suite you were staying in for the night looking up to the ceiling, knowing you're not getting any rest at all tonight or many nights to come.
