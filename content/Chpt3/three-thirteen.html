            Ryan came home to find you sitting on the sofa watching tv "Hey babe, whatcha watching?" you heard Ryan's voice entering the living room, you didn’t even heard him when he came in "Oh, hi baby, I didn’t hear you come in sorry. I'm watching a documentary." "About?" Ryan asked as he sheds his jacket coming to sit beside you "Women that viciously killed their husbands." you said nonchalantly, while giving Ryan a kiss after he sat` next to you. "Yeah, that's not unsettling at all." Ryan said swallowing and you chuckled "I'm just getting ideas." you gave him a side look and smile before turning your full attention back to the tv "Getting ideas for what exactly babe?" Ryan asked as he slowly scooted away from you and you shrugged "In case, my husband pisses me off and I need a good way to get rid of him." you said looking to Ryan and saw he had a worried expression on his face, that made you laugh moving closer to him "We good, right babe? You're not angry at me or anything?" that made you laugh more "Ryan seriously? You really believe what I just said?" he shrugged not knowing how to answer, so calming down, you pulled him back to you and took hold of his hand "Ryan, baby, I was just joking, I would never kill you." "Are you sure about that, cause you know, they are times you can get pretty irritated at me?" you chuckled "Even those times, I still don't want to kill you. It's just a documentary babe, and they are entertaining." Ryan nodded still seeming hesitant so you took hold of his face and smothered him in kisses "Would a killer want to do this?" "It could be a cover up." you sighed "I give up, believe what you want." you said moving away from him, but Ryan didn't allow you to get far and he was pulling you back to him, but this time to sit on his lap. "I'm sorry and I believe you, just felt like messing with you." you just shook your head and tried to hide the smile that was growing on your face "But on a serious note, I wanted to ask you something and maybe tell you something." face turning serious you turned straddling his lap bringing your hands to rest on his chest "What is it?" Ryan hesitated before asking "If I had to experience a near death experience while working, would you want to hear about it or would you prefer to not be made aware of how dangerous my job can be?" That was a serious question Ryan just laid on you "Wow, um." you said thinking heavily about it, while Ryan waited for your reply his hands massaged your thighs "Well, I already know that your job is pretty dangerous, but I allow myself not to think about it. But yeah, I would like to know if you experienced something like that." "Are you sure?" you nodded "I'm sure baby. I am married to you so that means we're in this together, right?" you offered him a smile, bringing your hand up to caress his cheek, he offered you a smile of his own "We are." "So I'm guessing you had a near death experience today?" you swallowed waiting and preparing your heart for his reply "Sort of, but not really. We encountered a sniper today, and he shot at an officer that was with us. Thankfully he was wearing a vest, but after the hype calmed down it really crossed my mind that I could have been easily taken out." after hearing Ryan say that, your other hand joined the previous one, processing what he just said "But you're okay?" he nodded clearing your mind. Looking into his eyes, you brought his face closer to yours connecting in a kiss. It was a slow tender kiss, you just letting Ryan know how much you love him and how thankful you are that he's still here "I'm thankful." you said running your hands over parts of his face and Ryan closed his eyes in content at the feeling "I love you Ryan." you said titling your head to side, and that made Ryan open his eyes to meet your love filled ones "And I love you Heather." you were thankful that this man in your arms returns home to you each day.
