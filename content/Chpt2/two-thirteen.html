            "Honey I am home." you heard Ryan come in but you were in the kitchen on the island working on something on your laptop "Kitchen." you told him and there was a few moments before you saw him enter and you whistled taking a look at him, because you left before him this morning and didn't get to see how he was dressed "Hey, you like?" he asked after placing a kiss to your forehead before gesturing to his outfit "Of course, it's green." Ryan gave you a proud smile "I try to wear it as often because I know it's your favourite colour." "So these outfits are all for me?" you asked turning in your chair to face him and he nodded "Yes mam. I've realized that my wife loves to see me in green and it brightens her mood." he said while coming closer to you "It sure does." you reached up taking hold of his face pulling it closer to give him a kiss, and he was about to deepen it but you stopped him "What, I thought the green wakes up something in you?" you raised a brow at him, but that's a topic for later "It does, but while you came in I was working on some bug fixes and I don't want to lose my train of thought for them." "And I'm being a distraction?" you nodded "Yes, you are being a distraction." you said turning back to your laptop and Ryan came up behind you placing his head in your neck littering kisses "Okay baby, I'll let you get back to work while I go and run us a bath, how does that sound?" you leaned your neck to the side and hummed "That sounds perfect." he gave you one last kiss before leaving "I'll get on it.", you turned back on your focus to quickly finish your work.

            As soon as you were finished, you did an internal dance and jumped up running off to the bathroom, stripping your clothes along the way. When you reached the bathroom you were just left in your underwear "All finished now?" Ryan asked looking up as you entered the bathroom "Yes sir. I see you got started without me." you gestured to him in the bath already while removing the rest of your clothes "I just got in, but trust me, nothing has started as yet." a grin made its way to your face when you approached the tub and got in. Ryan gestured for you to sit against him which you did, resting your back against his chest and he brought his arms to wrap tightly around you. You hummed at the feeling of contentment you were receiving and Ryan proceeded to litter kisses in your neck, so you leaned your head to the side allowing him more access. "Gosh I love you." he said not stopping his assault, so you decided to turn in his arms and straddle him taking hold of his face "And I love you." you said before crashing your lips against his.

            You both just finished ate dinner and were currently in the living room on the sofa watching tv. "Hey babe, question, would you say I look like Jake Gyllenhaal?" you turned and looked at him inspecting his features "I could definitely see it." you said with a smile "It sucks that I have never noticed that before, because I find him pretty attractive." and Ryan raised a brow at what you said "Really?" you nodded "I guess I have a type, because I, myself, am very attracted to you." and Ryan chuckled "I would of hated it if you weren't." you laughed while giving his cheek a rub before turning back to the tv. "So who told you that?" you asked "It was from today's case, this lady that blogs everything that happens in the company, even Eric and I showing up, but instead of stating real names, she uses code names." "She clearly has nothing better to do with her life, to be doing that on company time. Isn't she afraid she'll get caught?" "She does it pretty secretly. Apparently with the use of a holographic keyboard." you did an impressed look "That's pretty cool honestly. I've been thinking about getting one for a while, but I'm a lover of the sounds of a real keyboard." "You know what it is?" you nodded "Of course, I work in the world of tech remember." "I honestly had no idea what it was when I saw it." "Maybe I should bring you more into my world, expose you to technology." Ryan chuckled "I would actually like that, because our tech guy Cooper, he belittles me for not knowing simple tech stuff. Sometimes I'm so tempted to tell him about you and say my wife is way smarter than he is. That the programs he uses, are ones that you helped build." you laughed "Okay calm down sweet boy, you're not in school." "He's just annoying sometimes." "Don't let him get to you and you never know I might meet him one day while at the building." and Ryan raised a brow "Why would you be there?" "Just work stuff, tech stuff, so I'm bound to meet him eventually." "Please if you do, promise that you'll belittle him." you chuckled because you can't believe Ryan allowed this man to get to him "Ryan I'm not a child." but he looked at you with pleading eyes "Fine, I'll see what I can do." and he smiled triumphantly "Thank you." he placed a quick kiss to your temple and you just shook your head.
