            You woke before Ryan this morning because you were crazy excited for the day you had planned before you. You and a friend of yours had a girls pamper day planned, it was supposed to be a spa day. So you were currently in front the mirror trying on different bikinis deciding on which one to wear for the day, but little did you know, that Ryan was awake watching you. Looking at the black two piece you were currently wearing and inspecting yourself, turning side to side, your mind was mixed, thinking if to pick this one. "Pick that one." Ryan's voice caught you off guard, making you jump. After composing yourself, you released a chuckled  "How long have you been awake?" you turned to look at him and saw he was laying on his side watching you "Long enough, but don't worry, you didn't wake me." you turned back to the mirror "So this one?" he nodded "Yes mam, you look very sexy in that one." "Okay, my husband likes this one, so I'll pick it." "Can I follow you wherever you go today?" Ryan asked with a hopeful look in his eyes and that made you come towards him "You know no guys are allowed." he sat up and went to the edge of the bed to take hold of your approaching body "Now that's not very fair." you placed your hands on his shoulders while he ran his hands along your sides "It's called girls day for a reason babe." he hooked his hands behind your knees and thighs bringing you to straddle his lap. "I know. Just looking for a reason to spend time with you while you're in a bikini." you chuckled at that "We went to the beach two weeks ago and you had a whole day with me in one." "But that was so long ago." "Okay, how about for your next day off we plan a couples spa day?" a wide smile made its way to Ryan's face "I would actually love that." "Good." you took hold of his neck bringing his lips to yours, while playing with the hair at the back of his head, the action made him moan in the kiss. "Think we can have a little fun before you have to get ready for work?" you asked him and he pulled away looking at the clock on the bedside table and before replying Ryan turned flipping you both over, laying your back to the bed, hovering above you "There's enough time for more than just a little fun." then he connected his lips back to yours.

            You were currently in the pool lounging with your friend, Monica, as you both were talking about different topics, that came up. You guys were enjoying your time so far and it was definitely deserved. "So was it hard to convince Ryan to let you come today?" Monica asked and you shook your head "Nah, no convincing was needed to be done. He encouraged it actually, said I needed it and to enjoy myself, not worrying about anything." "That's very sweet of him." you nodded "What about Chandler?" you asked her about her husband "He was pretty much the same, no convincing there either." she giggled at that, you leaned up and checked your phone for the time "Mon, it's about time we start to make our ways towards the massage section." "That got here pretty quickly. Let's go." with that you both got out the pool and went to get your things, but before you guys had a chance to get them, there was shouting and chaos suddenly. These masked men appeared with guns shouting orders, so all of you that were there followed orders, some getting shoved and pushed and unfortunately for you, you were pushed into a column corner, hitting your head. Your friend shouted for you, but she was told to shut up and move. Before you had time to compose yourself, you were lifted up and ordered to move as well, stumbling, you touched your forehead and saw there was blood when you looked at your hand. You guys were shoved into the females' locker room, and told to hand over all your belongings, so you all followed orders except one girl, she retrieved pepper spray and used it on one of the masked guys, resulting in her getting shot. Things went hay wire and the guys escaped taking the stolen belongings with them. The moment they were gone, someone called 911.

            Paramedics were first to arrive, and those injured got the assistance they needed, including yourself. Monica was by your side the whole time, and it didn't take long for the police to show up and you all were questioned. Frank was in charge of getting the witnesses names and when he saw yours he went to H. "H, there's someone here that you'll might want to see." with that H followed Frank and they went to see that you were on a stretcher being tended to, before they approached, H turned to Frank "Give Mr. Wolfe a call." he nodded and pulled out his phone while H left and went to you "Hey Heather." you heard a familiar voice that made you look up "Horatio." he gave you a smile which you returned "How is she?" H asked the paramedic "She's going to need stitches, so we're taking her to the hospital to also check and make sure she isn't suffering from anything else." Horatio nodded "Okay." he told the paramedic then looked to you "Hang in there okay, I'm going to get Ryan to meet you there." you shook your head "No, it's okay really, I don't want to take him away from his work." H took your hand "It's okay, I can spare him for a bit, just so he can know that you're okay." you nodded "Thank you." he gave you a smile before you were taken away.

            "Hey Frank." Ryan said into the phone "Hey Ryan, it's your wife." Ryan's heart dropped "What happened Frank?" and he explained the situation to Ryan, so he wasted no time in making his way to you. Arriving he asked for your name and was directed to where you were. When he saw you his heart became lighter, knowing that you weren't seriously injured "Heather." you heard his voice and followed the sound, he approached taking you in his arms "Hi." with your face in his hands, he inspected it while you smiled up at him "I'm fine Ryan. Just a gash and needed a few stitches." his eyes held worry "And that's it?" you nodded "They ran some test and I'm just waiting till they come back." you gave him a smile of reassurance. Ryan closed his eyes for a moment being thankful that you're alive and well, so you held his hands that was on your face and brought them to your lap "I'm fine Ryan, really." "I know I know, but the girl shot died and my mind just drifted." You didn’t know that, and now you understood Ryan's behaviour. Ryan remained standing by your side of the bed with his hands in yours waiting till the doctor returns and give you the all clear so you can leave.

        <p class="story">
            When you both were in the hummer you turned to Ryan "Would it be okay if I spent the rest of the day by Monica, till you finish work, then you can come pick me up. I just don't feel like being alone?" he took hold of your hand "Sure, whatever you want. Sorry I can’t spend the day with you." you squeezed his hand and gave him a comfort smile "It's okay, I prefer you out there catching the guys that did this, because I would really like back my bag and all my belongings." "Everything was stolen?" you nodded "It was the bag you gave me that you caught me staring at." "They picked the wrong person to mess with, I'll get everything back to you baby." "Thank you." you leaned forward and gave him a kiss.

            Ryan took you to Monica's house and then returned to work. While working he got caught up in a shootout and was faced with a guy with a shotgun but froze, and H took the shoot. That bothered him for the day, thinking he's out of touch, but H told him that he didn't had a clear shot but Ryan knew he did and froze. Sitting in the computer lab with Cooper, because they realized that a guy that works there has a peephole in one of the girls locker room and records them so that's what they were currently looking at "Why are you here, Ryan?" "What do you mean?" Ryan's eyes never left the screen, making sure you didn't use this locker room. "I thought you were working on something in the lab?" "I was, but I heard about the recordings so I wanted to see them for myself." Cooper gave a smirk "Just say you want to check some babes out." Ryan gave Cooper a deadpan look "Cooper, seriously what's wrong with you? A woman was killed and others injured." Cooper held up his hands in defense and apologized. There was no way Ryan would ever let Cooper know about you, so they both went back to watching the videos and Cooper was the first to speak again, making a joke about Ryan freezing and that pissed him off, so he got in his face and told him the opposite, and stormed out. Later in the day, they found the missing belongings but all IDs were missing, indicating a home invasion so officers were sent out to protect the victims including Monica and yourself. It was honestly a rough day for both you and Ryan and you just couldn’t wait till he finished work so you can go home to your warm bed and Ryan's arms.

            The evening came and when Ryan finished his shift he came, picked you up and drove home. "It feels so good to be home." you said your thoughts coming in through the door "I couldn't agree more." Ryan closed the door behind him and wasted no time in wrapping his arms around you "Work was good?" you asked Ryan looking in his eyes "It was eh, but the best part was getting the guys that did this to you." you offered him a smile "Thank you, my personal hero." sadness over took Ryan's face "I don’t feel much like a hero" you pulled away to look at him "Why not? Something happened today?" he sighed before answering "Today, when one of the guys appeared he had a shotgun preparing to shoot and I just froze." your head titled to the side "I don't understand." "When I should of shot him I didn't." you remained quiet for a moment not sure what to say "Did you get in trouble for it?" he shook his head "H covered for me, and said I didn't had a clear shot, but I did, Heather I had a clear shot and I froze." your hold on him tighten "Maybe you got so accustom working in the lab, that a part of you forgot what it was like when you were working in patrol." a smile made its way to Ryan's lips "It's funny because Calleigh told me the exact same thing, but you guys are right." "But knowing you, it's going to take a while for you to let it go?" Ryan chuckled with a nod, taking his face in your hands you reassured him "Well, although you don't feel like a hero, in my eyes you are." you leaned up and placed a kiss on his lips which he smiled into "Thank you." "Want to go and take a shower together, I need to wash the day away." Ryan nodded "Of course."
        </p><br>
        <p class="story">
            After showering, you were standing in the mirror checking out the cut on your face, there were stitches and a few bandages keeping everything in place. Ryan left you in the bathroom to go get dressed, so after a while when he didn't see you come out he went back in to check on you. "Hey, everything okay?" Ryan asked as he entered back the bathroom, you met his reflection in the mirror "Yeah, was just looking at the cut." he approached and stood beside you. "Does it hurt?" you shook your head "Nah, which I'm thankful for." Ryan brought his hand up to turn you to face him. Taking hold of your cheek he looked at you inspecting the cut on your forehead, it caused his eyes to sadden thoughts entering his mind at what happened "I hope you don’t mind me asking, but how did you get it?" you sighed leaning into Ryan's touch "I don't mind. I got pushed into the corner of a column, causing me to hit my head." Ryan's eyes darkened at that "I'm so sorry." "It's not your fault baby." Ryan sighed heavily before pulling you into his embrace, running through his mind was that he could of easily lost you today, knowing someone died from the incident "I could of lost you today." that made you pull away to take Ryan's face into your hands "But you didn't. I'm still here aren't I." you offered him a smile but he still sighed "I know, and I'm very thankful that you are, but I was so scared when Frank called me." "I'm sorry for worrying you." you rubbed his cheek "Never apologize for that baby, never." "Then let's take today as a win, okay?" Ryan nodded pulling you back into his embrace again. That night Ryan held onto you tightly at the fact that he almost lost you today.
