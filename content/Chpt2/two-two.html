            You were both currently on the sofa watching tv, well it was more like you watching tv and Ryan watching you. You were so engrossed that it took you a while to realize that he was looking at you "What?" you asked looking at him "You are real right?" he asked seriously and you raised a brow "Real how?" "As in, a real person, that is actually here, married to me, in real life and this not being at all a dream?" he said inspecting you, then reaching out to poke your cheek, and you slowly nodded "Last time I check, this is real, we're real. Why?" "Because sometimes this feels too good to be true." he said truthfully and you smiled "This is real Ryan, this is our reality." you reassured him and he sighed "Today's case, this lady, the last couple years of her life were all fake, this guy killed her husband, then met her and married her and brought along these two adults claiming them to be his teenage children and said he lost his wife to cancer and they did all of that just to get access to the yacht club to steal gold from one of the residence." Ryan just laid down so much info on you so you held up your hands "Wait, let me check if I heard you right, her current husband killed the past husband?" Ryan nodded "So they could meet and marry, and brought his 'fake' children, to pretend to be a happy family, just to get access to other rich people." "Pretty much, you got it." "And when you said steal gold, you mean like jewelry?" Ryan shook his head "Nope, I'm talking literal gold, like gold bars." "How much was stolen?" "Want to take a guess?" you thought for a moment "One million?" "Try higher." "Five million?" and he shook his head "Try ten million." and you gasped "Ten million in gold bars. Wow." you were speechless and amazed "My exact reaction when I found out how much." "That's so much money, like a huge amount." you still couldn't wrap your mind around it and you both just sat there for a moment imagining what it would be like to have that kind money, and you both sighed "You sure you donâ€™t have that kind of money lying around Ryan." "I wish." and you both laughed "But seriously, that was a pretty messed up thing to do to her, because she actually loved them and thought of them as her family, but it was all fake and they used her." that made you heart heavy "That is really hard to imagine, going forward for her is going to be hard cause you won't know what to believe anymore." "That is tough, but with us we're real to each other right." you looked at Ryan with a smile "Of course, I'm real as I come, and I hope I can say the same about you?" you raised a brow and Ryan laughed "Yes mam, this is the real me." "Good." you gave him a kiss before laying on his chest while he wrapped his arm around shoulder and you both went back to watching tv.
