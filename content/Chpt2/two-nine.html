            "Beautiful, I'm home." Ryan said coming in through the door and you immediately hopped up from the sofa and made your way to him "There he is, my gorgeous husband." you said approaching him, wrapping your arms around his neck, not giving him a chance to speak by pulling his face against yours and connecting both your lips together. The gesture made Ryan hummed into the kiss, enjoying this greeting from you. "To what do I owe the pleasure?" he asked pulling away "It's the green, seeing you in it does something to me, plus I really missed you today." you said before placing kisses in his neck. "So you're in that kind of mood?" and you nodded in a reply, so he signaled for you to jump up, which he caught hold of your hips as they wrapped around his waist. Connecting back his lips with yours he carefully made way to the bedroom, and placing your back gentle against the bed, not once breaking the kiss. In Ryan's mind he told himself that he has to wear green more often, because he is loving this.

            The love making went for three rounds, first in the bedroom, then the bath, then back to the bedroom and that's where you both currently were. Body intertwined with the bed spread, you were on your stomach with your eyes closed while Ryan was on his side leaning on his elbow looking at you while his free hand ran up and down your back. He could not stop staring at how beautiful you were, and how lucky he was to call you his. "I love you." you heard him say out of the blue making you open your eyes to meet his, offering him a smile you replied back "And I love you." with that he leaned down to place a tender kiss on your lips before going back to his previous position. Feeling contented once again you closed back your eyes. "How was work today?" Ryan asked drawing his hand lower down your back "Meetings and headaches, but the good kind of headaches you could say." your eyes opened now and you chuckled at the end "What about you babe?" he sighed before going to lay on his back looking up at the ceiling. "You know that game I used to play in my free time, the one that's similar to GTA?" he asked and you replied with a quick yeah while taking the position that he was once in, going to your side leaning on your elbow to look at him as he spoke "Well today's case was centered around that. The suspects brought the game to the real world, roleplaying the game, literally, each level." "So like the first level was robbing a bank so they actually robbed a bank?" you asked trying to see if you understand and he nodded before continuing "They did it all just like the game, even the point based part." you were actually amazed "That's honestly pretty crazy, and I always wondered why you stopped playing the game." "Because you can get additional points for raping women and that's what almost happened this morning." you felt a drop in your stomach "Just for points, they would do something like that? That actually makes me feel sick." the world is just filled with some wicked people, sensing your uneasiness, Ryan reached for your hand bringing it to his lips to place a kiss then intertwined your fingers with his "Don't worry, they never got a chance to do it, Delko was there." you looked up at that "Is he okay?" and Ryan nodded with a chuckle "He's more than okay, trust me." you raised a brow at that comment wanting Ryan to elaborate "In the security footage we saw him checking out a woman that was in front him at the atm." and you laughed at that "Did he get her number?" "Nah, he regret not getting it." and you just rolled your eyes with a laugh "Men." "What's that supposed to mean?" and you shook your head "It's nothing, I was just saying the phrase." "If you say so." "So, I guess then that in order to help with the case the game had to be played to find out what the culprits will do next?" you asked "Yes mam, and guess who had that job." your eyes widen "Ryan Wolfe got to play game for a job, you must have enjoyed it." you chuckled "Eh, not really, cause I kept dying and couldn't reach the third level to find out where they were going to next." "But you did eventually though?" Ryan nodded "The third level was them breaking into the police station to steal back the evidence from their case." you were just appalled, "Gosh, who made this game. So did they do it, go to the station?" "Yeah, which was stupid honestly cause one of them was killed and the other got caught." you just shook your head "I guess that saying that video games influence people is real." and Ryan nodded with agreement and you both chuckled at how silly it was before comfortable silence fell between you two so you moved to lay flat on your side resting your head back on the pillow. A few moments passed before Ryan broke the silence, "I saw Erika today." "Oh, what did she want?" "The usual, was at the crime scene at the bank and wanted information, but I rejected her like usual." "She doesn't give up does she." "She does not, but apparently there's a mole in the station, and that's how she's getting her information, and before you ask, it's not me, it never was, and she was the one that approached H about the information, not me, cause I refuse to indulge her." a smile appeared on your face "I was never going to ask if you were the mole, cause I know you aren’t, I trust you Ryan when you said you don’t engage with Erika like that anymore." "Really?" he asked turning to look at you with a smile and you nodded matching his smile "Really." He opened his arms gesturing for you to come closer, so you cuddled into his side resting your head on his chest while he wrapped his open arm around your waist, and he kissed your forehead, a worrisome thought crossed your mind "You're going to be okay at work right, with the mole and everything?" you asked looking up and he met your gaze "Don't worry about me beautiful, I'll be okay." Ryan reassured you but to make it solid he leaned down and place a tender kiss on your lips which you accepted "Trust me, it's going to be okay." "Okay, I trust you." you gave a smile before laying back comfortable on his chest, within Ryan's thoughts, he really wanted to believe the phrase that everything is going to be okay, but he has to trust the process and he doesn't want to involve you in case something goes sideways. Your safety is his top priority, so with that his hold on you tightened, just remind himself that you're here and okay.
