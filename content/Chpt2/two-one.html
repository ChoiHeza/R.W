            Vacation/honeymoon was over for both you and Ryan and it was time to return back to work so you both woke up this morning not ready for the honeymoon bliss to be over. "Good morning." you greeted Ryan after you both were fully awake "Good morning Mrs. Wolfe." and you smiled matching his "You aren't tired with that yet huh?" you asked "Nope, I don’t think I ever will be." he was tracing your arm up on down and you sighed "I need a longer vacation." "Same, but sadly the world goes on." Ryan said then placed a kiss to your forehead before getting out of bed. You both got ready for work and left the same time, because Ryan wanted to give you a ride so he can pick you up after work and take you out, because after all it was Friday so that meant ice cream night. Ryan arrived at the scene with Delko and Calleigh. They all headed to H for a debrief, and after he explained everything he welcomed them back "I'm sorry, guys welcome back and Mr. Wolfe, I heard congratulations are in an order." H said offering him a smile which he returned "Thanks H." "What are we celebrating? Did I miss something while we were on vacation?" Calleigh asked curiously and Delko smiled "I think I might have an idea what it might be." and Ryan chuckled "I got married." a huge smiled appeared on her face "No way! That's amazing Ryan, definitely deserve a congratulations." she took Ryan into a hug which he accepted "You really did it man, congrats." "Thanks Eric" "Alright guys let get to work." H said after congratulating him again. Ryan worked the case as any other usual day and before he knew it, he was on his way to pick you up.

            When he saw you exiting your building he got out and made way to the passenger side opening the door for you. He stood there with a smile on his face while he watched you approach the vehicle "Well hello there Mrs. Wolfe." you just shook your head "Oh Ryan, maybe marrying you was a mistake." you said with a giggle getting in to the passenger seat, then gave him a thank you when he closed the door. He jogged over to his side and got in. "I'm sorry but It just sounds so nice to say. It's something I've always dreamed about and it's actually real, so please let me enjoy this." you laughed "I'm not one to stop you." you were just about to put on your seatbelt when Ryan stopped you "Let me." "Be my guest." you said with a laugh, he leaned across you and secured the seat belt then proceeded to give you a kiss before sitting back in his seat, buckling himself in. "Ready?" he asked and you nodded "Yes sir." With that, he drove off heading to the ice cream parlor.

            It's the first time you guys came here since getting married, due to being away on your honeymoon trip. Walking hand in hand to the shop, Ryan opened the door for you to enter first hearing the bells jingle above. You entered and he followed, both heading to your usual booth. You both slide in and got comfortable "So what will we be having today, the usual or something different?" you asked "I'm thinking the usual, since it's been a while. It will help us get back into the swing of things." you nodded agreeing, so before Ryan could gesture for a waitress, a familiar face came over "If it isn't my favourite couple, welcome back to the Miami Chill, you guys disappeared on me for a little bit." it was Cameron, she was the head waitress here and she always served you guys whenever she's at work, so she has grown very familiar with you two "We didn't mean to disappear on you Cameron, life just played out unexpectedly recently." Ryan said causing Cameron to raise a brow, then you raised your left hand towards her, and she caught sight of the ring and a gasp escaped her "You guys got married?!" you nodded yes smiling wide then she looked to Ryan "So you know what that means, going forward, I'm not addressing you guys as Ryan and Heather anymore, I'm going to call you guys the Wolfe couple or the Wolfe's." she couldn't stop smiling and you both laughed at the name suggestions and you know Ryan was very happy at hearing that "You know what, I wouldn't have it any other way." he looked at you with a sweet smile before looking back to Cameron "I am really happy for you guys, so what will the Wolfe's be having this evening?" she asked grinning from ear to ear and you both matched her expression "We will have the usual please." Ryan answered for you both "You got it, I'll be right back." Cameron said leaving to get your orders, and Ryan looked to you with a grin, "She gets it." you laughed shaking your head.

            After a short wait, your ice creams were ready, but Cameron was busy on a call so she didn't get to bring them. Instead it was the waitress who flirted with Ryan a while back "Here is your order." she said in a deadpan tone, she placed down Ryan's then yours. "Enjoy." she said with a wicked smile and turned, but while doing that she made sure the tray she was holding hit your glass knocking the ice cream over to spill all on the front of your clothes, and you jumped up with shock at how cold it was "Oh my god, I am so sorry." she said, clearly not meaning it ecause she was trying to hold back a laugh. Ryan got pissed because he knew it was intentionally done, and he was about to approach her but you got to it first "What was this supposed to do?" you said gesturing to your clothes and she shrugged "I don't know what you mean." you smiled, today you weren't going to allow this girl ruin your mood and you know she's trying to piss you off but you're above her "It's okay hun, I get it, you're still growing up. Little girls always make mistakes" you said with a sweet smile and an apologetic face, and Ryan tried his best not to laugh, he should really be going to get something to help clean you up but he just had to see how this played out. The girl had a scowl on her face now, and she was getting annoyed "Excuse me bitch, I'm no little girl." "Then why are you acting like one?" you said with a raised brow, and you saw that popped a vein in her head. Ryan did as well, and he know what was about to happen, so he got up quick just as the girl was about to lunge at you. He captured her, and you didn’t move a muscle. A part of you knew Ryan wasn't going to allow her to touch you but just in case you wanted her to touch you first. "Let go of me!" she shouted in Ryan's arms and Cameron was finished with her call when she heard the commotion so coming over she saw you "Oh my god Heather, what happened?" she asked and you pointed to the waitress "She purposely spilt the ice cream on me." Ryan had her released now and Cameron gave her a look before apologizing to us "It's not your fault Cameron, it's okay. I think we'll just take these to go. I got to get out of these clothes." she nodded apologizing again "Let me get you another and pack the remaining to go. They're on the house. They were supposed to be a wedding gift but clearly I have incompetent workers, so next time you guys come, I'll give a proper gift, and you can't say no." you smiled "Thank you." "Okay, I will be right back, and you come with me." she said gesturing to the waitress, after they left Ryan looked to you "I have spare clothes in my bag, go get changed and I'll meet you outside, okay." you nodded, he gave you the keys and you left. Getting to the car you unlocked it and got his bag from the back seat. Searching you found a white t shirt and basketball shorts. You were currently wearing a dress, and Ryan parked against a wall so you had somewhat privacy. You put on the shorts first under the dress before taking it off, then placed on the t-shirt. Taking a plastic bag, you discarded the dress into it. Closing back the door, you hopped in the front and waited for Ryan.

            The ride home you guys just talked about what happened and Ryan felt pretty proud of you for holding your own, and he found it pretty entertaining, that made you laugh. You guys reached home in no time so entering the apartment you went straight to the laundry room to throw your dress in the wash. Coming back you saw Ryan was sitting on the sofa with the tv on searching through the channels "Looking for something?" you asked plopping down next to him "News mainly." before you could of replied Erika showed up on tv and you assumed Ryan found what he was looking for because he stopped channel changing, so watching intently you saw it was a recap from earlier today and you could see there was annoyance in Ryan's face. You got to see why because just then it switched to a clip of him talking about the new mafia "Ryan, how could you say that on the news?" you turned to look at him and he rubbed a hand down his face before replying "I didn't, that woman Erika recorded me without consent. I was just talking to Calleigh, and she approached so I told her off, and she probably got pissed from that so decided to air that clip." he sighed leaning back against the sofa after turning off the tv "That looks pretty bad." he gave you a no shit look "Sorry." you said raising your hands in defense and began to stood up but took hold of your hand halting you "Sorry, I'm not mad at you, I'm just annoyed at the situation." "Well did you get in trouble for it?" he shook his head no, so you came to stand in front of him between his legs "Then don't worry about it, don't let her get to you, and if she becomes a problem let me know." Ryan looked up at you with a smile taking hold of your hips "What will you do?" and you shrugged "Whatever you want, I don't mind throwing hands for you." he chuckled "I don't want you throwing hands with anyone, no harm must come to you while I'm here." "Is that why you stopped the waitress this evening?" he nodded "No one lays a hand on my gorgeous wife." that made a smile and blush appear on your face, wanting to leave from the compliment but Ryan pulled you down towards him making you straddle his lap "But lowkey though, I wanted to see you beat her." you laughed "But you had to hold her back, why did you think I didn't flinch or move." "I just thought you knew I had your back. Wait you wanted her to hit you first?" you shrugged "Maybe." and Ryan smirked "Now I kind of regret it, holding her back." you chuckled "You wanted to see me fight?" you raised a brow and Ryan massaged your thighs "I think it would have been hot, watching you beat someone." you laughed "Don't judge me okay, I rarely see you get angry and when you do it does something to me." "Pervert." "How am I a pervert for finding my wife hot when she's angry?" "You just are." you placed a quick kiss to his lips before getting up "Where are you going?" "To shower, want to get that waitress bad vibes off of me, and also I think some ice cream went between my breast." Ryan ears perked up at that "Can I help?" "Do you even have to ask." that was all Ryan need to hear before he got up and lifted you causing you to giggle, as you both head to the bathroom.
