            Ryan called to let you know that he's going to be a bit late this evening because him and Calleigh were going out for beer, after having a rough kind of day so you told him it would be okay. Dinner was already finished so you decided to work on some bug fixes while waiting till Ryan came in. After an hour or so the apartment door opened and Ryan entered. "Hey hun, I'm home." "Welcome!" you called back to him from the living room still working. It was a few before you saw him enter "Hey." he greeted making you look away from your laptop towards him "Hey, how was it?" "Drinks with Calleigh? Was good, she offered and how could I of said no." he chuckled "So what brought this on, the random outing?" Ryan was leaning against the entrance way with arms folded and foot crossed at the bottom. "Let's just say we got into a disagreement today while talking about something, and the whole lab heard about it via Delko and they all thought we got into a fight. It wasn't anything major, and I will not tell you what it was about because I already know you're going to lecture me and agree with Calleigh." you laughed at that "You just know me that well huh?" he nodded coming towards you "That I do, and looking back I understood where she came from and I was wrong." you rested your laptop on the coffee table turning towards Ryan as he sat next to you on the sofa "Well look at you, I'm impressed." "I guess my wife is a good influence on me because she makes me a better person each day." you smiled up at him and placed a kiss on lips "That's sweet." "That's the truth." and you rolled your eyes, then going to inspect his outfit for the day "Mr. Wolfe, I see you have been wearing green a lot lately." you said with a raised brow "It may or may not have something to do with it being my wife's favourite colour." he said with a shrug, then took off his jacket and you saw it was a green t-shirt underneath "So you're just trying to hit my weak spot huh?" you asked coming closer to him "Maybe. Is it working?" he asked smugly and you moved yourself to straddle his waist and offer a shrug yourself "Maybe." his hand involuntary went to your waist "But why Ryan, suddenly with the green? I know you aren't doing it just to get into my pants, because you don't have to find reasons for that, so what's the real reason." you massaged his shoulders and he sighed while rubbing his hands up and down your thighs "I guess I'm trying to enjoy your joyful expression more these days just in case I lose my eye sight. I want to do things that brings out the excitement in your eyes." your heart sank at his reply, so you took hold of his face making him look at you "Babe, nothing is going to happen to your eyes, you are not going to lose your sight okay." "How can you be so sure?" "Because I believe in The God, and he'll make sure that you have your eyesight till the day you die, I promise, also the doctor said that's all going to be okay." he sighed and nodded trying to believe it all "You will be fine Ryan." he closed his eyes for a moment registering it all that you just told him then opened to see a beautiful smile on your face. You leaned in and gave his right eye a kiss. "See, there, I fixed it." you said with a chuckle "Always knew you were a miracle worker." he laughed as well "So you're okay?" he nodded "I'm okay, because I have you." he gave you a loving look before giving you a passionate kiss "I'm blessed." "That you are." then his stomach grumbled "And also apparently hungry." you chuckled "Go shower and I'll heat dinner up." you said placing a quick kiss to his forehead before getting up "Yes mam." he watched you disappear to the kitchen before he got up himself to go shower.

            After dinner, Ryan was washing the dishes while you went back to working on your bug fixes. There was a comfortable silence between you two just in your own worlds, but Ryan was the first to break it. "I may have done something today that sucked ass." the comment made you look up instantly with a raised brow "Is it going to piss me off?" he shook his head "This was out of my control." "I'm listening." he paused doing the dishes and turned to face you "Remember I told you that there's a mole at the lab." you nodded "Well, H approached me with an idea of how we may find out who it is." he sighed heavily before continuing "By telling the team secretly in ways that I have nerve damage in my eye." your eyes widen but Ryan reassured you "I donâ€™t actually have nerve damage. It was just a lie, and I told that to Alexx today." your heart sank "Babe, I highly doubt Alexx is the mole, because she helped you so much when it came to your eye." Ryan sighed and lowered his head "I know, and I hate that I did that, but H said trust him, that it won't fall back on me." all you did was shook your head "As your wife and meeting Alexx, that's going to bite you in the ass, because she's going to be hurt when she finds out the truth." "It may not be that bad." you gave him a raised brow "Trust me, she will be hurt, you know why, because she trusts you and she believes that you trust her. That's all I will say on the matter and you will not like the look on her face when you tell her." he sighed and regret instantly took hold of him "I'm sorry." "I'm not the one you should be apologizing to, but if H said trust him, then trust him." you told him turning back to your work. Ryan knew you were right but he was caught up in a predicament because it was H's plan, but deep down already knew it's not Alexx, but it's better to be safe than sorry and he hopes she understands when he explains himself. "Maybe if she is really pissed maybe you can talk to her for me?" Ryan asked with pleading eyes and you thought for a moment "We'll see how it goes, and if you royally screwed up, then I'll see what I can do, she loves me after all." you flipped your hair "Thank you baby, don't know what I'll do without you." "Probably be making awful life decisions." "You are not wrong." you both shared a laugh going back to your tasks at hand.
