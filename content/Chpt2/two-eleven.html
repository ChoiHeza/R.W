            "Babe, you know what's something we don't do often enough?" Ryan asked you as he entered the bedroom "And what is that?" you asked back while putting away laundry "We don't argue often." Ryan said sitting on the bed "And isn’t that supposed to be a good thing?" you paused to take a look at him "Yeah it is, but isn’t that troubling, cause normal married couples argue a lot." you shrugged "I don't think it is troubling, that just means we aren't a normal married couple." you told him going back to your task "Plus that's for people that's been married for a really long time, or been together for quite a while." "But we have been living together for almost four years now." and you laughed "I think we haven't reached the point where we are sick of each other as yet." you put away the last piece of item before going to sit with Ryan on the bed "Why though, you want us to be a couple that argues?" and he chuckled "No, of course not, it is nice that we get along well with each other, but most times when couples argue they make up." a smile made its way to your face thinking that you caught on to what Ryan was trying to imply before you could of reply Ryan smiled as well "What?" "I just have an idea to what you maybe implying." he shook his head not catching on "What are you talking about?" he asked truly confused "Maybe I misunderstood the direction you were going for." "Now I'm curious, what did you thought I was thinking about?" you sighed before replying "Couples that argue make things better with makeup sex, and it's supposed to be the best kind ever." and Ryan laughed, now it was your turn to ask what "I was thinking that but I just wanted you to say it." you gasped and shoved him "Ryan Wolfe, I cannot believe you." you stood up wanting to get away from him and all you could hear was him laughing "Come on babe, don't be mad at me. I just saw the opportunity and took it." "I don’t want to hear it." you said leaving the room and Ryan got up following you, "Come back." you heard him coming after you, before you could protest, Ryan took hold of you from behind wrapping his arm around your waist keeping you in place "I'm sorry baby." you sighed "I mean it." and you released chuckled failing to keep your laughs hidden, he turned you in his arms and took a look at your face "You were never annoyed?" and you shook your head grinning and he his face matched yours "It's hard to be annoyed at you." "This is what I mean, we get along too well that we barely get annoyed or mad at each other." "Be thankful, because we could have been hating each other instead." he tighten his grip around your waist and you brought your hands up to wrap around his neck "But I would really like to try make up sex." and you laughed "We'll get there eventually, and don’t go purposely trying to cause a fight between us just for sex in the end cause trust me, I would make sure you don’t get any." Ryan did a crying face at what you just said "Fine, I won't." "Promise me." he sighed "I promise." you gave him a smile "Good." and you leaned up and placed a kiss on his lips "Let's get something to eat." "Yes mam." with that you both broke apart and headed off to the kitchen.
