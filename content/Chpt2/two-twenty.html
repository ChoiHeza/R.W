            You were currently watching the news with a book in hand when you heard Ryan come in "Hey babe, I'm home." "Hey!" you called back to him and he followed the sound of your voice to the living room after he took off his shoes. "Hey." he came into view with a smile on his face while taking off his jacket "What are you looking at?" "The news from what happened today, with that Bonnie and Clyde couple. It's pretty crazy." Ryan took a seat next to you, placing a kiss to your temple before placing his arm around your shoulders "I was there when it went down." "You were in the car chase?" Ryan nodded "I'm sorry you guys didn't catch them." he shrugged his shoulders "Yeah it sucked but I guess they knew what they were doing." Ryan gave a thin line smile. After the reporter was finished you changed the channel to become background noise "Besides that incident, how was work today?" you asked placing down your book before turning to Ryan "Stressful, and not the good kind." you chuckled "I'm listening." "Erica happened." Ryan released a big sigh before continuing "She never listens when told to stop or back away, and because of that she got shot today." your eyes widened "Is she okay?" Ryan gave you a look "Are you really worried or just trying to be nice?" you thinned your lips before replying "What do you think?" and Ryan laughed "Naughty, but yeah she's okay, was just a graze." "That's good I guess, just make sure she doesn't get you killed." "Won't ever happen." he gave you a reassurance smile "But enough about her, how was your day, my beautiful wife?" that made you smile "Would you like to hear about it over a shared bath?" Ryan's eyes lit up at that "That sounds perfect."

            "Could you ever imagine being that crazy in love." you guys were in the tub sitting across from each other. "I could imagine it." you gave Ryan a tilt of your head "To the point that you die together?" you asked with a raised brow and he thought for a moment before replying "Maybe, it is a bit extreme, but I get it. My love for you is really strong to the point that I would literally do anything for you." your eyes softened at that "As sweet as that is it low key scares me a little bit." you said with a measurement of your fingers and Ryan chuckled "Why would it scare you?" "Because as a cop it seems like you would commit a crime knowing it's wrong." "The thought has already crossed my mind and let's just hope it never crosses to that." your hand flew up to cover your mouth "Are you Ryan Wolfe saying that you would commit a crime for me." he slyly nodded before shushing you and you gave him a side eye "This conversation never occurred." Ryan nodded "It never did." a smile appeared on his face, before he leaned forward pulling you towards him "Have I ever told you how beautiful you are?" you were on his lap now "No you haven't. Not once have you ever said that to me." Ryan's smile grew wider "I haven't, then I must be an awful husband." his arms snaked around your waist pulling you closer against his body "Well my wife, you are beautiful as you are gorgeous." each compliment he gave to each part of your face, he followed it with a kiss. "And these lips, they are not enough words in the world to describe how amazing these lips are." he rubbed the pad of his thumb across your lips, which resulted in you giving his thumb a kiss "Gosh I love you, and you have no idea how much." before you had time to reply yourself, Ryan took hold of the back of your neck, pulling you in for a very heated kiss, taking your breath away.
