        It was your off day today so you made sure to wake up early enough to
        make sure Ryan had breakfast and lunch to take to work. You both already
        ate breakfast and Ryan returned to the bedroom to get ready for work.
        Just as you were finished packing his lunch, he came into view fully
        dressed, except his jacket, he usually puts it on when he gets to work
        "Look at my gorgeous husband." he threw a smile your way, "Thanks baby."
        he placed his jacket at the back of the chair while buttoning up his
        sleeves, you saw he was struggling so you approached him to help "Let
        me." he raised his hand towards you "I see you're wearing green." you
        smiled up towards him "It sort of became a habit, seeing my wife eyes
        lit up every time she sees me wearing her colour. I've come to love it."
        your heart swelled at what he said so you leaned up and gave him a kiss
        after you were finished with the last button. "I guess you're the
        world's best husband. Also I have your lunched all packed." "And I guess
        that makes you the world's best wife then." you giggled at that while
        getting his lunch, while he took up his jacket. You walked him to the
        apartment door, and waited for him to put on his shoes before giving him
        the lunch. He leaned in and place a sweet kiss on your lips "Be good
        today." "Always." you gave him a kiss of your own and you both said your
        byes and he was gone.

        You were currently wiping down the kitchen counter when you heard the
        apartment door opened. Your ears perked up at that and was about to ask
        who was there but you heard Ryan's voice "Hey babe, you here?" you
        stopped what you were doing and went to him "Yeah, everything okay? Why
        are you home so early?" Ryan sighed, not sure how to start to explain
        what's happening or what happened, so you approached him taking hold of
        his hands "Babe, you're starting to worry me." he looked down and sighed
        once more before looking back up to you "While coming from the crime
        scene and returning to the lab, I got into an accident, and I'm fine. I
        just didn't see the other person in time." you were confused "So that's
        why you're home, I don't understand?" his grip on your hands tightened
        "I haven't been completely honest with you." he took a pause before
        continuing "I never went to see the doctor." Ryan saw the disappointment
        starting to reach your face so before it could get worse, he started to
        explain himself "I was scared okay, and yes I was in the wrong, for
        lying to you and not going, but that's why I am here right now. H told
        me to go and see a doctor and I want you to come with me." your brain
        try to process everything that Ryan told you, but instead of getting mad
        you understood him and knows that he needs the support of a loving wife
        right now than an angry one. "Of course, just let me go and get ready."
        "Thank you." "Of course baby." you leaned up and placed a kiss to his
        cheek before heading off you change.

      <p class="story">
        You were both currently in the waiting room, waiting for Ryan's name to
        be called. His fingers were intertwined with yours, his hand resting in
        your lap. You saw his leg bouncing knowing that he was nervous and
        scared "It's going to be okay Ryan, I'll be here the whole time." his
        leg stopped and he looked up at you giving your hand a squeeze "Thank
        you so much for being here with me." "No need to thank me hun. I am your
        wife, we're in this together." he offered a smile trying to calm his
        nerves "Ryan Wolfe." a lady came out and called his name catching both
        of your attention, so you turned to him "I'll be right here." you guys
        shared a quick peck and he let go of your hand following the lady into
        the room. While sitting waiting you decided to play a game on your phone
        to calm your nerves hoping that Ryan was receiving nothing but good news
        from the doctor. A decent amount of time passed before you saw Ryan
        emerging from the room and making his way towards you, and the look on
        his face made your heart sank, so you put away your phone and stood up
        waiting for him to reach you. "Ready to go?" he asked and you nodded,
        you both walked out the building hand in hand going to his car. The
        drive home was mostly quiet "I'm assuming it's not good news?" you said
        softly and Ryan sighed "Not really, but not all bad. I just don't feel
        like talking about it right now." you nodded not bringing it up anymore.
        Ryan wanted to make sure that it didn’t feel like he was shutting you
        out so he reached for your hand and intertwined his fingers with yours
        bringing it up to kiss the back of your hand then placing them in your
        lap.

      <p class="story">
        "I got to head back to work and talk to H, so I'll see you this evening
        when I come in." "Okay, we'll talk then right?" "We will." he gave you a
        sad smile then placed a passionate kiss on your lips before leaving.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="story">
        While in the locker room after talking to H, Ryan was pissed, to the
        point that he was punching the lockers. He really doesn't want to lose
        his job, and he doesn’t know how to tell you what the doctor told him.
        He just hated the situation that things were in at this moment, hoping
        it would all go away. So sighing and realizing he can't delay any
        longer, he clocked out and made his way home, stopping along the way to
        buy you flowers, because after getting the news that he may lose his
        sight he wants to enjoy every moment with you and see it all. Coming in
        through the door he called out for you "Baby, I'm home." you were in the
        living room when you heard him, so you got up to greet him at the door
        "Hey, welcome." you came into view and a smile made way to his face,
        gosh, you were so beautiful. Seeing the flowers you pointed at them
        "Occasion?" you asked and he shook his head "Just wanted to get my
        gorgeous wife some flowers and to see her reaction to them." a smile
        made way to your face loving them when he handed them to you "They are
        gorgeous." you sniffed them "Same as their owner." you blushed and
        leaned up to kiss him but he captured your face keeping you there
        deepening the kiss "I'm feeling so loved right now, my husband is
        wearing green for me and he bought me flowers." "That's because you are,
        and you deserve to know it." you both shared a smile and attached back
        your lips together.

      <p class="story">
        The way Ryan made love to you felt like he was going to lose you. You
        were currently taking a nap being tired and Ryan was watching you
        peacefully taking in every feature of your face and body that was
        outside the covers. If he were to lose his sight he wanted to savor it
        all while it lasted. He brought his hand up to brush along your cheek
        and that caused you to stir in your sleep, so you slowly opened your
        eyes and met Ryan's gaze "Sorry for waking you." he said giving you an
        apologetic smile "It's okay." you smiled back at him. You inspected his
        face as well and saw that his mind was busy "What's going on up there in
        that mind of yours?" he sighed and brought his hand to rub along your
        side "I guess I can't run from the situation anymore." he explained and
        told you everything that the doctor told him today and you listened
        intently offering him comfort along the way. "But that's not entirely
        bad news, we just have to stay positive. It may not look that easy right
        now but we have to and believe that everything will be okay. It's just a
        gut feeling I have but I know that everything will be okay eventually
        with your eye, let's just trust the process and be patient." Ryan was at
        a loss for words not knowing what to say. All he could do was stare at
        you and smile, feeling so lucky to have you by his side. He pulled you
        into his side placing a kiss on your forehead "I am so blessed to have
        you by my side through this. I don't know how I could handle this
        without you." "For better or for worst, in sickness and in health." you
        recited a part of the vows from your wedding and Ryan chuckled "That
        felt like yesterday, but that was one of the best days of my life." and
        you smiled remembering the memory "It really was nice." you looked up at
        Ryan "I love you." you said kissing his chin and he looked down at you
        "And I love you more." you giggled "Well I love you most." you told him
        and he chuckled "So it's a competition now?" he asked with a raised brow
        "Even if it became one, we can go on forever and ever with this, because
        we clearly both love each other the same amount." Ryan pulled you to lay
        on top of him so his face was before yours, and he stared intently into
        your eyes "Jokes aside, I really do love you with my every being." and
        you smiled with your heart swelling "I know you do baby. You make sure I
        know it every single day." he looked at you once more and lean forward
        connecting his lips with yours, it was just tender and filled with so
        much love. "Never forget it." "I won't." you gave him a reassuring smile
        which he returned, eyes never leaving yours.
