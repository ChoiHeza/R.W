            You were sitting on the sofa watching tv while Ryan was in the bedroom, he just finished showered. "Hey babe, did you see my red socks?" he said from the entry way of the living room "Which ones?" you asked not taking your eyes from the tv "I have more than one red pairs?" and you chuckled finally looking at him "Yes Ryan, do you not know the socks you own?" "Clearly not, I just put them on." and you laughed getting up to join him "You have three pairs of red socks, one with black strips at the toes, the second one with grey spots at the bottom while the third spots are black." "I clearly wasn't very observant of my socks." you started to head to the laundry room and gestured for Ryan to follow "And that's very bad, considering your job is forensic scientist." you looked back to give him a disapproving look, "Not my fault my brain switches off at home, this is my safe place." that statement made your heart swelled so you hid your smile "Well, currently one of them are in the laundry basket and the other two are in the basket to be put away." you told him gesturing to the baskets "You're the best." he chuckled placing a kiss to your temple "I know." you said before leaving going back to watch tv. After a couple of minutes Ryan joined you in the living room plopping down on the sofa next to you "I now see what you mean, I guess I never really noticed because the designs are at the bottom." "Fair enough." you said with a chuckle "So does this mean I know you better than you?" you turned on the sofa towards him "Maybe my clothes, because I bet if I had to ask you questions about myself you would get some wrong." and you raised a brow "Is that a challenge Mr. Wolfe?" "You really think you would get all of them right?" and you nodded now he was intrigued "Okay, let's see if you know me as well as you say." he turned facing you as well, and started questioning away.

            "How?" "Because I'm observant, and I always pay attention to you." Ryan was very impressed, the smile wouldn’t leave his face, you got everything right, even down to his favourite mole on his body. "Want to give it a go?" and Ryan hesitated "I don’t know, now what if I don't do as good as you, would that make me a bad husband and awful CSI, because that's a key part of my job and also being your husband." and you laughed "Ryan, you're worrying too much, they're just questions, and no it doesn't classify your title if you get any of them wrong." "That's easy for you to stay, you got all of them right." but he sighed "Fine, ask away." and you did, asking him questions about yourself and even threw in some you think he would not have remembered about you but he proved you wrong and he got all of them right "And you were worried about what exactly?" you asked with a raised brow "Not being a good husband, I do pay attention to you, but this proves that I have no reason to doubt myself." "You never should babe, you're amazing, both a great husband and CSI, and if you weren't I wouldn't be here and you wouldn't be working that job." he nodded agreeing "You're right." you leaned and placed a kiss on his lips "So breathe." "Yes mam." then he looked at you intently thinking before you could of asked what he spoke first "You are happy with me right?" "Of course I am Ryan, what did I just say about doubting yourself. I've come to realize that lately you don't listen to anything I say." you chuckled "That's not true, I do listen to everything you tell me, while you were talking to yourself yesterday while working, I listened to it all." "You listen to me when I talk to myself?" you asked him with lit up eyes "Of course, it's cute, sometimes I think you forget that I'm here if you want someone to talk to but I know that's how you process your thoughts so I don't interrupt, just listen in instead. At first I thought you used to be talking to someone until I realized you weren't." you quickly hid your face in embarrassment "Oh gosh, you must think I'm crazy." and Ryan chuckled pulling you against him "Not for a second did I ever thought that, like I said, I find it cute, so please don't ever stop, but honestly I don’t think you could if you wanted to." you looked up and smacked his chest but he was right, that's a part of you, it just happens without you even realizing, "Thank you." "What for?" "I guess for being you." you offered him a sweet smile and he replied with a tender kiss to your lips "I love you Mrs. Wolfe." a smile gracing his lips, he never stops and you giggled "and I love you Mr. Wolfe." with that he connected back his lips with yours.
