            Ryan just finished his shift, and was in the locker room getting his stuff, because he made dinner plans for you guys. Making sure he had everything, he realized a didn't had his wallet, even after checking his locker, then remembered back to where he saw it last, on the dresser. Sighing he turned to Delko who just finished his shift as well "Hey." Delko turned to him "Yeah?" "Can you lend me some cash?" Delko chuckled "What happened?" "I made dinner plans with Heather, and it's my turn to pay but I forgot my wallet on the dresser." "Why not just get Heather to pay?" Delko ask retrieving his wallet "Now that doesn't make me a very good husband does it, I made the plans and then ask her to pay. No." Delko laughed "I get you man, don't worry. How much do you need?" Delko asked and Ryan told him the amount "Thanks man, I'll pay you back tomorrow." "No problem, just go have a nice evening." "Thanks man, we will. Later." "Yeah, later." with that Ryan got his bag and left.

            You were in the bathroom at work freshening up when you got a text from Ryan letting you that he's outside, replying back you're coming, you got your things and left the building. Coming down to meet Ryan "Hey beautiful." Ryan greeted as he stood holding the passenger door open "Hey handsome." you greeted with a kiss to his cheek before getting in. When Ryan made sure you were safely in, he closed the door and got in his side. He took hold of your hand before speaking "Ready for a fabulous evening my wife?" you nodded "Yes sir." he brought your hand up to his lips leaving a kiss at the back of it "Let's go." with that you guys were off.
