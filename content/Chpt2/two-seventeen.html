            You were dancing and vacuuming with headphones on so you didn't hear when Ryan came in and that's how he found you when he came home. With a smile on his face he rest down his bag, took off his jacket and leaned against the entry way with his arms folded watching you. You were doing your little dances while cleaning the living room carpet, and Ryan's heart swelled at coming home to this sight. Coming home to you each day just filled him with so much love and joy. With your back turned you had no idea he was there so when you switched off the vacuum and turned, you jumped not expecting to see him there. Clutching your chest you took off your headphones and Ryan tried to stop himself from laughing "Ryan!" "I'm so sorry baby, but I didn’t want to disturb you from enjoying yourself." you gave him a look calming down your heart, you stopped the music then rest down the headphones placing your hands on your hips "How long were you standing there?" Ryan fake looked at his watch before folding back his arms "Three minutes." watching his arms move and the way they were folded made you realized something. Forgetting what he just said you approached him with a new topic in mind "Have you been secretly hitting the gym?" when you got in front of him you felt his bicep, he gave you a shy smile "Maybe, was supposed to be a secret." you gave him a smirk and raised brow "Well I like." you said squeezing his biceps some more and inspecting them "I wonder who my husband is trying to get sexy for." he took his arms and wrapped them tightly around your waist "Could only be my wife. I like when she checks me out, she doesn't think I notice but I always see when she does." you tried to get out of his arms "I don't know what you're talking about" but he tightened his hold on you "Oh really, the same way that you don't secretly take pictures of me, when you think I'm not looking." and you gasp "How do you know about that?" "Like I said babe, I notice, you aren't that smug." you gave him a side eye "Well, it's not a crime to check out my husband or take pics of him." you said trying to defend yourself "I know, cause I do it too." your eyes widened "You what?! You take pictures of me as well?" "Of course, but unlike you, I'm more sly with it." you were amazed, not once have you seen him secretly take pictures of you, your mouth was open in shock so Ryan reached up to close it "Close your mouth babe, you'll catch flies." you squinted your eyes at him "I hate you." "You know it's not good to tell lies." he said and before you could say a comeback he lifted you up and tossed you over his shoulder "Another reason for working out, I love carrying you around." he smacked your bum and you protest hitting his back "Put me down Ryan." "Why should I?" "Because I will behave." his ears perked up at that "And you will also give me a kiss?" you sighed "Yes, and I will also give you a kiss." with that he put you down but held onto you so you won't escape "My kiss mam." you rolled your eyes and leaned up planting a kiss against his lips and he smiled triumphantly when you pulled away "Thank you.". Going back to the vacuum to put it away you asked Ryan "Had a good day?" "Of course, it started off perfectly." he said with a wiggle of his eyebrows "Pervert." you said dragging the machine "Not this time I wasn't. Need help with that?" you shook your head "I got it."

            After putting away the vacuum Ryan disappeared to the bedroom. You entered expecting to find him undressing to shower but instead he was standing in front the closet going through the clothes inside "Looking for something?" you asked coming to stand next to him "Just looking a t shirt that I thought I had at work in the locker, but I was wrong, so I'm hoping to find it here."  "Which shirt?" you asked "The purple one." you thought for a moment "I think I know where it is, hold on." you said leaving the room heading to the washroom to retrieve the shirt, it was in the machine waiting to be washed, so you took it out and returned to Ryan "It was in the machine waiting to be washed." you said handing the shirt towards him "Oh, then I'll just get another one then." you nodded and went to put the shirt back then returned to the bedroom sitting on the bed watching Ryan "This black shirt looks really nice on you." that made him stop what he was doing and turned to you with a raised brow "Nice like handsome, or nice like you want to have me?" he asked making you laugh and you shook your head "Ryan Wolfe, can't you just except a compliment, but it can be both depending on the situation." you told him honestly "And which is it now?" he asked with a smirk that you would love to wipe off his face "The first one, mixed with cute." he look dumbfounded and puzzled not expecting that reply "Cute?" you nodded "Yes, you look pretty cute right now. I don’t know what it is, but you looked extra cute today." he closed the closet door and leaned his back against it folding his arms "So some days I have a different look?" you nodded once again "Yeah, some days like today you look really cute, then there's some you look incredibly sexy and others where you just look straight up handsome." Ryan was listening intently taking in every you were telling him cause this all brand new information. "What help contributes to these looks?" you thought for a moment "It depends, it could be what you wear, or how your face looks." he chuckled "How my face looks?" "Yes, as of now your face looks really cute, like I could just shower you in kisses at how adorable you are." when Ryan heard that he pushed himself off the closet making his way towards you, "That honestly doesn't sound bad." he sat in front of you like he's presenting his face to you "What are you doing?" "Giving my face to be showered in kisses." that made you giggled, he's definitely adorable, and that's just what you did, you showered his faces in kisses and Ryan enjoyed every bit of it.
