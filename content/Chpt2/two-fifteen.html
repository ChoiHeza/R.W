            You were currently blasting music and cleaning the kitchen, doing your little dances and just having a good time, but since you were playing the music from your phone, whenever a call comes through it stops the music and that's just what happened. So sighing heavily wondering who is disturbing your jam session, you went to your phone to see who the culprit was. It was your supervisor Brady "Hey Brady, what's up?" you answered into the phone "Heather, I come baring bad news, you wouldn't believe what happened?" you sighed immediately knowing what happened "Which server crashed?" "The second one." your heart sank at the news, because that's not good "Need me to come in?" "Yeah, or I wouldn't have bothered you." "Okay, let me just get changed quick and I'll be on my way." "Thank you so much Heather. See you when you come in." "No problem." you hung up and quickly made way to the bathroom to freshen up and then the bedroom to change your clothes. You were about to grab your car keys but remembered it’s in the shop so you had to take a cab. After you made sure you had everything you were out the door and on your way to work, but little did you know that you forgot your wedding rings on the kitchen counter because you took them off to clean.

            Ryan came home and said his usual greeting but got no response from you "Heather." he continued to search the apartment while calling out for you but came up empty. Returning back to the kitchen he took off his jacket and placed it the back of one of the chairs by the island before reaching for his phone in his pocket, but something glimmered out the corner of his eye and upon investigation he saw it were your wedding rings. Panic started to settle in and he immediately called you but got no response and tried again and again but nothing. In his mind he started to wonder if you left him, did he do something that annoyed you and caused you to leave him and the fact that you weren't answering your phone didn't settle right with him. Things have been good recently but only up till this morning when you guys got into a little fight but he thought it was resolved before you both left this morning for work. "She wouldn't just get up and leave me right." Ryan said to no one really in particular but after some pacing and more panicking, he decided to try calling you again, and this time he was successful "Hey babe, sorry for missing your call, been super busy." a sigh of relief left Ryan "Where are you?" "Currently at work. I was home cleaning when I got the call that one of our servers crashed so I had to rush to the building." then everything fell into place. The reason you weren't here when he got home and why your rings were on the counter. "Oh okay, was just worried for a bit when I didn't see you. What time will you be finished?" "Not completely sure as yet." "Okay, when you're finished give me a call so I can come and pick you up." "You got it babe. I got to go." "Go go." you both said bye then hung up.

            After Ryan got your call that you were ready, he made sure to take up your wedding bands from the counter before leaving the apartment. When he reached outside your building he texted to let you know he was outside, so you bid everyone a bye before going down to meet him. Seeing him you waved and he got out to open your door for you. After making sure you were in he went to his side and got in. "Got everything sorted out?" he asked as he drove off "Wasn't easy but we got it done." "That's good" "I'm sorry for not calling or messaging you, you must have been worried." Ryan did a nervous chuckle "About that, for a moment I thought you actually left me." your head snapped towards his direction "What made you think that?" you giggled at the situation "I came home to the apartment empty then I saw your rings, and you weren't picking up your phone." "Oh my Ryan, I am so sorry. I can see how it may look that way but me actually leaving, sounds odd." "I know I know, because I could not find out why, because everything is good between us." "I am so sorry for panicking you, forgive me?" he took hold of your hand placing a kiss to the back of it "Nothing to be sorry about, I just thought wrong for a second." before you could apologize again he stopped you, letting you know it was okay. After driving for a while you realized that you guys weren't heading home but instead heading towards your favourite restaurant. "I hope you don't mind, but I got the sudden urge to take you out to dinner" you shook your head no "Not one bit." after a while Ryan arrived and parked. Just when you were about to get out Ryan stopped you "Wait a minute." you watched him as he reached into his pocket and pulled out your wedding bands causing you to laugh "Really?" "Really. Hand." he said holding out his hand which you placed into his "Heather Wolfe, would you do me the honors of being my wife?" he asked with such a bright smile "Why of course Ryan Wolfe, I would love to be your wife." you giggled and with that he slipped the rings onto your finger. You faked gasped and pretend to look at the ring, then you both broke out into a laugh "Let's go get something to eat." you nodded "Yes sir." with that you both got out and walked hand in hand towards the restaurant.

            You both were now coming in through the apartment door after coming from dinner. "Showered already?" Ryan asked you while taking off his shoes "Yeah, before I left for the office, why?" "No reason really. Just if you had to shower I didn’t mind showering again." and you laughed "Really Ryan?" he nodded, "Yeah." you just rolled your eyes and headed for the bedroom "Not my fault that I love bathing with you." he followed you "Didn't say anything was wrong with it." you started to change out of your clothes into your night ones, but Ryan stopped you "Don't wear clothes to bed, nothing sexual, just want to feel your body warmth on mine." you raised a brow but listened to him "No tricks." he raised his hands in defense "No tricks, I promise." "Okay." you chuckled and left for the bathroom to brush your teeth. While brushing you saw Ryan enter the bathroom through the reflection of the mirror, he came next to you and got his tooth brush after giving your bum a squeeze. Watching your reflection in the mirror Ryan asked you "Enjoyed dinner tonight?" you nodded and spat out before replying "It was nice. Felt like a while since we went to dinner." "I agree, we've both been so busy. Let's make time tomorrow, get all dressed up and go out for a fancy dinner." a smile made its way to your face "I would love that." you both finished up in the bathroom then went to bed. Ryan cuddled in your side placing his face in your neck while humming "So warm and so soft." he placed a ticklish kiss there making you giggle "Go to sleep Wolfe, no funny business, you promised." "I'm not doing anything, just enjoying my wife's body, that's all." "Yeah yeah." "I'll behave, I promise." "Good." you shared a quick kiss "Good night beautiful." "Good night babe." with that he cuddled back into your neck getting even more comfortable and before you know it, you both were off to dreamland.
