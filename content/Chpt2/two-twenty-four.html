            Ryan came in through the front door "Hun, I'm home." you didn't hear him because you were currently in the bedroom putting away the laundry while watching Friends on tv. Not hearing you, Ryan figured you were in the bedroom or bathroom, so he took off his shoes and made way in search of you "Hey babe." you heard Ryan said from the bedroom door making you turn to greet him "Hey hun, sorry I didn’t hear you come in." before you had a chance to make your way to Ryan, he was already in front of you, wrapping his arms around you pulling you into a tight embrace against him and he buried his face between your neck, something felt like it was wrong "Hey, is everything okay?" and you felt Ryan shake his head no so you started to comfort him by rubbing your hands up and down his back "Whenever you're ready." you told him and he raised his head taking his left hand to capture your face to look deeply into your eyes "You know that I love you with everything, that I am so in love with you, right?" Ryan told you, but it felt more like he was asking you "I know you do Ryan, what's wrong, you're scaring me a little bit." you asked him with concerned eyes and he closed his for a bit removing his hand from your face and brought it to join his other on your waist, so you took this opportunity to gently place your hands on Ryans face and that action made him release a sigh he was holding onto, and you started to massage his cheeks with your thumbs "Marisol was killed today." Ryan said opening his eyes and your actions halted at the news, and eyes widen a bit "H's wife, Eric's sister?" you asked just to make sure you were hearing correctly and Ryan nodded "I have to give them a call. How are they doing?" "I don't know, they're just busying themself trying to find the person behind it." and you gave a nod not knowing what else to say, there was some quiet before you decided to speak up but Ryan beat you to it.

            "Because of what happened I think we should go back on what we said." you tilted your head confused "Me introducing you to the rest of the team, and telling them I'm married, but after what happened I don’t think it would be best. It could become dangerous for you. They were targeting H and got her instead and it crossed my mind, what if that was us, they were targeting me and went for you instead." that statement caused you to pull Ryan into a tight embraced and he allowed it, he squeeze you tightly not wanting to lose you "I understand." "I just want to keep you safe, I don’t know what I would do if something happened to you, knowing it was because of me." you pulled away and looked him in the face "Ryan, now don't think negative. We will be fine, I will be fine, I trust you to keep me safe and it's okay if only H and Eric knows about us." you said reassuring him, cause you know how his mind wanders "I'm so sorry Heather." you shushed him "Ryan stop it, I knew what I was getting into when I married you. I knew the dangers of it, and I said yes anyway, do you know why?" you asked and Ryan shook his head no "Because you are an amazing officer and not once have I ever felt that my life was in danger or is in danger, because I know you will keep me safe, and I can keep myself safe." Ryan bowed his head "Ryan look at me." he did "We will be fine, God is on our side, and us both are going to be living till old age. You got that?" and he nodded "Not good enough CSI Wolfe, be more vocal, so let me hear you, till old age, right?" you said again sternly making a smile appear on Ryan's face "Yes mam." you shook your head still not satisfied "That was not good enough, I need more reassurance from you CSI Wolfe." you said a bit louder this time and Ryan chuckled before replying louder "Yes mam!" and he even threw in a salute for good measure and you laughed out and hit his chest "That's what I like to hear." you looked up at him with the biggest grin ever and all of Ryan's worries washed away, cause you're right, he's going to keep you safe no matter what. Right there Ryan fell deeper in love with you "Gosh I love you, how did I get so lucky." he said admiring you with so much love in his eyes "Because you deserved it and I love you." he brought his lips to yours and gave you such a loved filled kiss and pulled away "You always know how to make a situation better. How to make me feel better, how to take away my worries.  What would I do without" he said tilting his head going back to admiring you "You would be homeless." you joked breaking apart from him going back to your previous task. "Don't worry, I've always got you. No matter the situation, I'll always be by your side." you told him truthfully taking a quick look at him "Oh be still my sweet beating heart." Ryan said making you laugh, he gave you a quick kiss and a smack on your bum before heading off to the bathroom. "By the way, how was court this morning?" he stopped in front the door taking off his jacket "Was a mess, there was a shootout." he said before entering the bathroom, taking the shirt that was currently in your hands you followed "Um, excuse me, a shootout?" "Yeah, one of the guys in the audience started shooting." he was removing his clothes "And you're okay right?" "If something happened I would of told you, so you don’t have to worry." he gave you a reassuring smile and you said an okay and he chuckled "I'll leave you to shower." you said beginning to leave the bathroom "Hungry?" you asked stopping by the door "I could eat." Ryan said turning on the shower "Okay, I'll heat up dinner, cause I cooked already. Need anything else?" "No mam, you've given me everything I currently need." you rolled your eyes at his statement "Goodbye Ryan." you said causing him to laugh as you closed the door leaving.

            You only had a little amount of clothes left to put away so you dealt with that before going into the kitchen to heat up dinner. Although you had already cooked you usually wait till eat when Ryan's home so you guys can eat together. Just as you were finishing up at the stove Ryan entered the kitchen "Finish?" he asked coming beside you "Just about, could you grab the plates please." you told him turning off the stove. When Ryan rest down the plates you placed the food on and you both decided to have your dinner in the kitchen sitting on the bar stools. "So how was your day hun?" Ryan asked as you both ate, and you told him about your day as he listened intently commenting from time to time.
