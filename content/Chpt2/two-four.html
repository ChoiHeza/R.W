        Ryan got home before you today because it was going to be a late day for
        you. It was a new project you guys were working on and you wanted to
        reach a certain way before leaving work for that day. Ryan took the
        opportunity to do some cleaning and fixing while you weren't home. You
        mostly did it because you're always home first, his schedule is always
        really busy while yours is more freeing, so any chance he got to pitch
        in he would. It was two hours before he heard the apartment door open.
        "Hey hun, I'm home." you said coming in through the door, and it was
        Ryan's turn to greet you this time. "Hey you." you took off your shoes
        and rest down your bag before jumping unto Ryan, and it caught him off
        guard but he reacted quickly enough to catch you. "Feeling energetic?"
        he asked chuckling "Not really, I've just always wanted to come home and
        do that but I'm always here first." before you gave Ryan a chance to
        reply you attached your lips to his in a pretty heated kiss and he
        caught on. Wrapping your legs tighter around his waist, Ryan brought you
        both to the sofa laying your back to the surface, hovering over you,
        deepening the kiss.

        You were both currently in the bath tub sitting opposite of each other,
        enjoying each other company and the warmth of the water. "Have you ever
        received any love letters before?" Ryan asked out of the blue and you
        chuckled "So random, but yes I have." he raised a brow "From who?" "An
        ex boyfriend in secondary school, when we were dating, he used to write
        me poems and love letters." "Really?" you nodded "Out of all the guys
        you've dated, was he the only one?" you thought for a moment "I think
        there was another one but he only wrote one letter." Ryan said a silent
        wow "What?" "Oh nothing." he said avoiding your eyes "Tell me." Ryan
        sighed before replying "Writing you a love letter never crossed my
        mind." "And that has you upset because?" you said not catching on "That
        is a really nice gesture, just can't believe I never thought about it."
        "Ryan that is okay. Don't beat yourself up over it, plus that was a long
        time ago." "I know but still." you moved forward and sat in Ryan's lap
        wrapping your arms around his neck "Ryan, I am married to you aren't I,
        plus you can be very romantic and sweet when you need to be and although
        you never wrote me letters, they are a lot that you've done for me that
        no other guy ever did" and he wrapped his arms around your waist pulling
        you closer against him "Like?" "Let's see, buying me flowers, took me
        out to dinners, saved me from spiders, cooked dinner for me, ran baths
        for me, took care of me when I'm sick or suffering from really bad
        cramps." and you gestured to your finger before saying the last thing,
        "You bought me a wedding ring, and honestly that's the best thing I can
        ever receive, along with giving me your last name." Ryan looked at you
        with so much love and you're right, he has given you the best thing "You
        do have my last name." he said that like it's registering for the first
        time "Are you now realizing this babe, you've been saying it nonstop
        since we got married." "I know but like, you have my last name, my
        name." yup, it was really registering in his mind. Watching his face go
        through so many emotions made him super cute and your heart just filled
        with so much love looking at him, you couldn't help yourself from
        crashing your lips against his, halting his mind whirring. Bringing your
        hands up to play in his hair at the back of his neck, you pulled away,
        just looking at him with so much love "What?" he asked looking your
        expressions over "I donâ€™t know, it's just that I feel so much love for
        you right now. Like I'm looking at you and I know that I love you with
        everything I have." he brought his hands up rubbing your back "It's nice
        to know that I'm not the only one." you were both smiling "And I love
        you as well." with that he crashed his lips back to yours.
