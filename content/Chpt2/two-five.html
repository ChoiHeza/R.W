            You felt relieved that you didn't had to cook dinner this evening, because Ryan promised this morning that he'll bring in take out, so you took this opportunity to just sit and relax after working pretty hard today. You heard the apartment door opening so you hopped up from the sofa and made your way there "Hey hun, I'm home." Ryan said. You rounded the corner and saw he was taking off his shoes "Hey baby, welcome home. You got the goods cause I'm starving?" standing up Ryan gave you a confused look "What goods?" "The take out?" you were standing in front him now and saw his hands were indeed empty and he sighed rubbing his hand along his face "I'm so sorry baby, I completely forgot." and you brought your hands up to capture his face "It's okay." you placed a quick kiss to his lips "I had the money, but Erika came by and I gave her all the money I had in my wallet, sadly it wasn't enough" what he said made you lean away from him and give him a raised brow "Why would you do that?" "Because I broke her recorder, when I got mad at her for recording me behind my back." "It seems like she's around a lot these days." you said stepping away from him heading to the kitchen "Come on babe, you know it's not like that." "Right…." you said while pulling open the take out menu drawer "It was just that one time, and it was for the case." all you did was nodded going through the menus looking for the place that Ryan was supposed to buy food from "Not you too." with that you looked up at him, giving him a look to explain "Delko is back on my case again for talking to her, and he's blaming me for being the leak to the media." "I can't blame him, I can see why." you said with a stern look before going back to the menus and Ryan sighed "Heather, you know that's not true." it was your turn to sigh now and you looked at him "Ryan, you converse with her, for reasons I don’t know why, and people see you doing it, and some reason, they're stuff on the news that only you guys should know, but trust me, I want to believe you." he approached you now and turned your body to face him "Babe, there is nothing going on between us and I am not the leak, I don't tell her anything that goes on in the lab, plus every time she approaches me I always turn her away." you folded your arms "Does she know you're married?" you asked with a raised brow and he looked down "That's what I thought, and it's funny because you are always eager to tell the world that we're married, just not her, why's that?" he was on the spot now "I guess I just didn't want to piss her off, plus I still owe her money" "And who cares if she is pissed off cause right now I am." "You're right I shouldn't care, and I should of told her I'm married." you scoffed "A little too late for that don't you think." you took a deep breathe before continuing "Do you still have her number?" Ryan nodded, not surprising "Call and tell her to meet you because you have rest of the money for her." Ryan fished out his phone from his pocket "But I actually don't." he said while looking for her number "How much more do you have to pay?" "Four hundred and twenty dollars more." and your eyes widen "What the hell Ryan, that's pretty expensive for a recorder, was it dipped in gold?" "Funny enough I said the exact same thing." he was about to chuckle but saw your expression and realized you weren't in a joking mode "Just call and set a place to meet now, I'll get the money." you said leaving him and he hit call on his phone "Hey Erika, I have the rest of your money." was the last thing you heard Ryan said before you disappeared into the bedroom for your purse retrieving the money. After you made sure you had enough you took the purse and went back to Ryan, he just hung up "What did she say?" "She said she'll meet me at the park nearby." you nodded "She'll meet us, let's go." you gestured to Ryan heading for the apartment door "You're going?" "Of course, cause it seems pretty difficult for you to cut off ties with someone, plus it's my money that's paying her back, I deserve to meet her." Ryan nodded and kept silent, and you both left the apartment.

            You both were currently walking in the park heading to the destination of the meet up and Ryan was contemplating if to reach out and hold your hand because he knew you were pissed at him and he didn't blame you, cause he was in the wrong, but his decisiveness was cut short when he felt your fingers intertwined with his, looking down he looked at you wondering what caused the action but that wasn't until he looked up that he saw why, Erika was approaching from a distance, so he leaned in to whisper to you "Are you going to play nice?" "Should I?" "Generally I would say you don't have to but she's a news reporter and she could make us look really bad to the public eye." you looked up at him with a 'are you serious look but his eyes pleaded with you, you thought for a moment and realized he was right, she could make Ryan look bad on news and you didn't want that. "Fine, only because I love you, and I don't want you to get in to trouble." he squeezed your hands and mouthed a thank you. "Hey, thanks for meeting me." Ryan was the first to speak when she approached, time for you to play nice "Hey Ryan, didn't expect you to have company. Who is this?" she said looking down on you cause she was clearly way taller but you didn't let that phase you. Before you introduced yourself Ryan beat you to it, "This is my wife, you can call her Mrs. Wolfe." you smiled and reached out a hand towards her which she took and squeezed your hand a little too tightly "Nice to finally meet you, I've heard so much about you." "All good things I hope." she said directing a smirk towards Ryan before looking back to you "No first name?" "You heard it, it's Mrs." your sweet smile not once faltered and she nodded "All right then, do you have it?" "I do." you said catching her off guard as you reached for your purse "What do you mean?" "I'm paying you back, for the recorder that Ryan broke." you took out the exact amount needed and handed it towards her "Thanks I guess. I thought Ryan was going to pay back." and you waved her off "We're married so we share debt, plus I offered to pay it back." "I apologize again for breaking it. Won't happen again, also I meant what I said the other day, lose my number." Ryan said with a straight face at the end, before you gave her a chance to speak to turned to Ryan "Babe, we should get going, I'm starving." and he looked down at you offering a smile "Yeah, let's go." then you both looked back at Erika and told her bye "It's was nice meeting you." you waved with a smile as you both walked away.

            In the car, before Ryan drove off he turned to you "Are you still mad?" you thought for a moment and shook your head "No I'm not, after the way you talked to her I felt better, and the more I thought about it, I get it why you didn't want to piss her off, but you were still wrong for not letting her know you're married." Ryan nodded listening to everything you said "Well she knows now." he turned and started up the car "And I saw what you did there when you introduced me, not giving her my name. Damn, news reporters are some dangerous people." you said with a chuckled then looked to him "Thanks." "I just didn't want her to know anything about you." you offered a smile "Ready?" and you nodded, and Ryan drove off to finally get food.

            Back at home you guys were currently at the kitchen island eating your take out. "So a wives weekend ended in a murder, that sounds pretty interesting." you chuckled "With the way the case went, it really was, because all three of us had different suspects thinking we had the killer, but little did we know that we should of worked to together instead of working on our own." "I see, so that means that communication is definitely the key." you said with a raised brow hoping Ryan was catch on to what you were saying and that he did "Yes babe, you're right, communicating goes a long way, I'm sorry." you nodded and gestured for him to continue "So after we came together, we found the real killer, it was the husband of one of the wives." "Damn, did not see that coming, all of this just because of a pool boy. Please tell me at least he was pretty?" and Ryan laughed "I wish I could say he was." and you gave him a look "Are you just saying that for the sake of it?" and he shook his head "No I'm not, he really wasn’t." "That sucks, they threw away it all for nothing." you continued eating "Please promise me, that in the future, if you do something like this with friends, you won't cheat on me with a pool boy ." you pretended to be serious for a moment "But what if he's like really sexy, and superhot?" that made Ryan give you a look and you laughed breaking character "I'm kidding, you know I wouldn't. If you continue to treat me well throughout our whole marriage, I won't have a need to leave you, cause I get all my loving from you, plus I'm a one man kind of woman anyway." "Then I have nothing to worry about, cause I'll never stop giving you loving." "That's what I like to hear." you offered him a kiss to the cheek "When we're finished want to watch a movie?" and you nodded "Yes sir."
