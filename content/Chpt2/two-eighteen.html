            Ryan was in a computer lap putting into work some of the computer stuff he's learnt from you. Delko entered the lab and him and Ryan had a little banter on Erika because of the news. After they cleared that up Delko asked him "What are you working on?" "I am checking Mr. Rowe's computer for any information that may have been missed." "I thought it was wiped clean?" "It was, but there is this cool trick that I picked up from Heather, she told me although things were deleted doesn't mean that they're actually gone, it's all still stored on the hard drive, you just need to know where to look and how to retrieve them." Delko was impressed "And how does she know this?" "She works in tech, she's like Cooper, but way smarter." Delko chuckled at that "Someone smarter than Cooper, my day just got better. So with your new found knowledge, what were you able to find." Ryan did more searching and retrieved the info displaying it on the screen for Delko to see "The guy was a white supremacist, well that's something." "Yeah and based on these documents, he found out his wife's mother was black." Delko shook his head "Apparently he wasn't happy about that, cause it seems he wants white babies." that low key annoyed Ryan a bit "That's honestly an awful reason to kill someone. I'll let H know." with that Delko left Ryan there staring at the computer, then you crossed his mind hoping you've never faced racism while you've been living here. As the case progressed Ryan just hated the guy more, because of the fact that his wife was killed because of her race, and that was honestly messed up.

            Coming home, Ryan saw that you weren't in as yet, so he just took off his jacket and sat on the sofa to watch tv while he waited till you came home. Twenty minutes passed before he heard you enter. "Sorry for being late, work things." "It's okay." you quickly took of your shoes and headed towards the direction of Ryan's voice, entering you saw he was laid back on the sofa watching news. "I heard about this today at work, was this a case you worked on today?" with the sound of your voice, Ryan tore his eyes away from the tv to drink you in, you were wearing a pencil skirt along with an orange button up long sleeve. He left before you this morning so he didnâ€™t get to see you all dressed up. He whistled at your look making you giggle "Don't you look gorgeous, I see you chose to wear orange." you made your way to him and took the seat beside him "Had meetings majority of the day, so the fancy office wear had to come out, plus I said why not secretly match with my husband today." that brought a smile to his, "I love it." he gave you a look before placing a tender kiss to your lips "Besides the meetings, had a good day?" you nodded "What about you?" you said gesturing to the tv which made him remember the question you asked earlier "Oh yeah, I did work that case today." "It sucks what happened, killing your wife and in an awful way at that" Ryan sighed "But you won't guess why they killed her." you turned a bit to face Ryan "Why?" "Because she was half black." you rapidly shook your head confused "Is this a race thing?" "It was, he was a white supremacist and when he found out his mother in law was black, he was not happy about it." you honestly could not believe what you were hearing, you rubbed your face replying "A woman lost her life because she was half black, that's messed up, but then again, the world is still a pretty messed up place." you shook your head "Why not just divorce her?" "I don't know, but also his concerns were what the babies would have looked like, I think he wanted white ones." you sarcastically chuckled at that "He really said that, the audacity of that man." you scoffed and Ryan reached over to place a his hand on your thigh "People like him are stress, don't let it get to you." you sighed and took hold of Ryan's hand that was on your leg "You're right." silence fell between you two for a moment "I'm thankful you never faced any racism while you were here." you gave a nervous laugh to that and Ryan caught on "Heather, is there something I don't know?" "It was maybe a year ago, when I went shopping for a dress, I got treated poorly because of the colour of my skin and they assumed I was there to rob them. Even went as far as calling the cops for me." Ryan was fully turned to you now and just looked at you bewildered "What?! How comes I never knew about this?" you shrugged your shoulders "The whole situation really upset me and when I came home I just didn't want to talk about it or recall those memories." Ryan's heart sank upon hearing this and couldn't believe this happened to you "Babe.. I'm so sorry you had to experience that." you offered him a smile "It's in the past, and it was one time. I try to not let it get to me." a part of Ryan kept wondering why you didn't tell him about it "Promise me something." "Sure" "If it happens again, I really hope it doesn't, but if it does please tell me." your heart softened at that "I promise." "Thank you." "So, we're ordering in this evening?" you said starting to get up  "Yes mam." before you could of left Ryan took hold of your hand "Wait a minute." you raised a brow but he quickly pulled you into his lap "What's this about?" "I didn't get to greet my gorgeous wife with a kiss." with that he took hold of your neck and pulled you in for a kiss, the kind that leaves you dizzy.

            After eating and showering you both we cuddled on the couch watching tv. "Today got me thinking, if we had children, I wonder what they would look like." Ryan said taking your attention away from the tv "Why, you want white babies too?" you said joking making Ryan laugh "Actually, I would of preferred if they looked one hundred percent like you." that made you lean up to look at him with a wide smile on your face "Why do you say that?" "Because you're drop dead gorgeous, and if our kids got your looks, I'll be very happy." "But what if I wanted them to look like you." "With this nose, and these lips, no, our children will be bullied at school." you tried to hide your laughter by covering your mouth "But I love this nose." you said kissing his nose "And these lips." then you moved to kiss his lips lingering there a bit longer. Ryan hummed before replying "As sweet as that was, I still want them to look like you." "Well we aren't in control of that." you said going to lie back on his chest "I know, but I would still love them no matter what." he kissed your forehead turning back to the tv. Then something else from today crossed Ryan's mind that he forgot to tell "I completely forgot to tell you but you would never believe what happened. I used some of the knowledge that you thought me to retrieve some deleted files from a hard drive, and that's how I found out our friend had a unforgivable secret." you leaned up once again with a proud look on your face "Ryan Wolfe, look at you being a techy, I love to see it." you placed a quick kiss on his lips "I am very proud of you." "It felt nice, I'll be willing to learn more." "No problem, anything you need to know to help with cases. I'll show you" "Thank you" he offered a smile before you guys shared a quick peck before you both went back to watching tv.
