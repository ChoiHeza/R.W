            You were currently laying on the sofa with a good book, just winding down from your day, patiently waiting till Ryan comes home. It felt like a while since you've seen him because he had to work a double shift. It wasn't long before you heard the apartment door opening and heard his voice "Hey babe, I'm home." "Hi!" you called back, and he followed the sound of your voice after taking off his shoes "Hey you." a smile appeared on his face at the sight of you. You looked up from your book towards his direction, and before you had time to get up, Ryan took off his jacket and made way to lay himself on top of you, head resting in the crook of your neck. Taking one hand from the book, you went to rub his back. "I'm assuming you're pretty tired." "You have no idea." you heard him mumble from your neck making himself more comfortable. Resting down the book on the coffee table you brought the other hand and hugged him tightly "Hungry?" "Not really, but I just want to stay like this for a while." "No problem." with that you picked back up your book and went back to reading, and surprisingly before you knew it Ryan drifted off to sleep.

            It was a full hour nap that Ryan got before you felt him stir, signaling that he was awake. He sighed before leaning up to look at you, so you rest the book down once again "How long was I out for?" you checked the clock on the wall "An hour and some, you were tired." Ryan exhaled before laying back down feeling lazy. "There's no rush for you to get up, take your time." you said holding him close to you "I know but I'm getting hungry." you chuckled at that "Want me to heat up dinner?" "Yes and no, because I'm hungry and I don't want you to depart from me." you chuckled at that "Well you have to pick one." before Ryan replied you heard and felt his stomach grumbled "I'm guessing the first one." he laughed leaning up, he gave you a sweet look before you guys shared a kiss "I'm going to go and shower." he said getting up and pulling you up with him "And I'll go heat dinner up." with that you both broke apart and went your separate directions.

            "Would a pick up line like that work on you?" Ryan asked you as you both were eating dinner "The lint bit?" he nodded and you shook your head "Nah, I'm not that easy, but it is clever though. And it clearly works because they kept doing it."  "So it's not that weird?" "The lint part no, but holding the seminar and handing out the lint. That’s the weird part." Ryan shook his head "I think it's interesting, because they help guys that have problems picking up girls." you raised a brow at him "Why does it sound like you are one of these guys?" Ryan laughed and shrugged his shoulders "Maybe." your eyes widen at that "I find that very hard to believe. You strike me as the kind of guy that used to flirt with every pretty girl he saw." he chuckled at that "Did I flirt with you when I first saw you?" you tried to think back to the moment looking for the answer and shook your head "When I think back on it you didn't. Maybe I wasn’t pretty enough." "You were actually too pretty. My exact thoughts were that you were the most beautiful woman I have ever seen." a blush came to your face making you smile "And I regret not asking you out then and there." "But you did eventually, so don't worry about it." Ryan paused for a minute before replying "That's actually incorrect, it was you that did first." you gave Ryan a look while you were searching your brain "Is my memory that bad, you asked me for my number?" Ryan shook his head "You asked me for mine." you thought some more then the memory came back to you in full "I did ask for your number, but when you really think about it, you made the first move when you offered to help me look for a place. Admit it, that was you flirting." Ryan chuckled recalling the memory "Oh yeah, my thought process was that I wasn't going to let you get away this time. I took it as a sign from God because I met you for the second time." you chuckled "And as much as I hate them, we need to also thank the spiders." that made Ryan laugh "It truly is funny." you joined in with a laugh of your own.

            "The bed is calling my name." Ryan mumbled while brushing his teeth "You're soon there baby." you were brushing your teeth as well, looking at his reflection in the mirror you could see the tiredness in his eyes. He quickly finished up and left you there heading off to the bedroom. When you were finished, you exited the bathroom turning off the light. You found Ryan already under the covers arms open waiting for you "Hurry, my eyes are closing, and you I need you in order for a good night's sleep." you chuckled at that "I'm coming I'm coming." with that you turned off the light and got under the covers as well and entered Ryans arms. The moment he felt you there, his hold tightened on you bringing your body right up against his and he inhaled your sent before releasing a contented sigh. "Goodnight beautiful." Ryan said with a kiss to your forehead "Goodnight love." with that you both fell into slumber.
