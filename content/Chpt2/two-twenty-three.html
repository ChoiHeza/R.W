            After what happened today with Alexx, Ryan knew you were right, so on his way home he bought you flowers. Yes it has become a bad habit of his buying you flowers when he's messed up but it helps, somewhat. So before he entered the apartment, he sighed and stepped in knowing already what you're going to say. "Hey beautiful, your husband is home." "I'm in the kitchen." he heard you called out, so he took of his shoes and stalked his way over there. Seeing you, he made sure the flowers were in full display and that caused your face to lit up. You were in front your laptop working but you got up and approached him "Hey you." you leaned up and gave him a sweet kiss and he gave you the flowers, smelling them you looked up at him and when you saw his facial expression you knew something was up, so you sighed before saying "What is it you did this time Ryan?" he scratched the back of his neck while replying "You were right." "About?" "The situation with Alexx, I told her the truth today, and everything you said, was exactly how it played out." you raised a brow and shook your head "I know I know, you can say I told you so." you just sighed and smiled "I'm not going to do that, because you realized what you did was wrong and you owned up to it, but what I will say is don't be sorry, be better." Gosh Ryan loved you "Has anyone told you how perfect you are?" he said trying to charm his way "Nice try Wolfe, but save it for Alexx." and he nodded "So you're not mad at me?" you shook your head "I'm not. You were given orders and you were just following them." you offered a smile to show it was okay and Ryan released a breath that he didn’t know he was holding. 'The flowers really do have magic.' Ryan thought to himself. "So besides disappointing Alexx, how was your day?" you asked going to put the flowers in waters and Ryan grimaced at your question "Why did you have to word it like that?" and you just shrugged "It was good because apparently something amazing happened this evening." "I'm listening." "H got married" and you gasped "What?! That's great." "And you wouldn’t believe to who, Delko's sister." your mouth was opened now "What?! How long has that been going on? Did Delko approve? Damn, did not see that coming." Ryan laughed at your reaction and excessive talking "I think they have been together for only a couple months or shorter than that. I'm not sure of the exact timeframe and no Delko didn't approve at first but he came around." this was so much info to wrap your head around "A couple months, damn Horatio, get in there." you said smirking and Ryan laughed "How do you feel about it?" "I'm happy for them, they're in love and that's a green flag in my book." you nodded, once they're happy that's all that matters "But the situation had me thinking." Ryan started to say approaching you and taking you in his arms "What if I introduce you to everyone at the lab? It was a fear of mine because of my line of work but after seeing H do it, and not hiding, made me think that it may be okay. But that's only if it's okay with you." you stared up at him with a proud smile "You would really want to do that?" Ryan nodded "I would love to do that." "I don't mind, because if you say it's okay, then it's okay. I trust you." Ryan beamed at you brightly before connecting his lips with yours.

            "I saw the news of a celebrity that was killed today, did you work on that case?" you asked Ryan as you both were in bathroom, he was just finishing up brushing his teeth and you were doing a face mask. He nodded, then washed out his mouth before replying "Yeah, it was her assistant that killed her because she was getting kicked out of a show." you just shook your head "That's crazy, how did she go?" "Electrocution from a tanning lamp while she was in the bath." your face grimaced at that "Damn, that's a way to go." Ryan nodded, looking at your reflection in the mirror "It is, and it can happen to anyone, so please promise me that you won't have any electronics near the bath when you're in it." "Yes sir, I won't risk my life that way, and that goes for you." Ryan chuckled "The only reason I'm ever in that bath is because of the naked lady in it, and she's my entertainment." that made you laugh "Don’t make me laugh, I don’t want to ruin the mask Ryan." "I'm sorry, but it's true." and you just shook your head "Whatever you say Mr. Wolfe."
