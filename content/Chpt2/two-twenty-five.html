            You were currently in the bath taking a soak, body a bit sore from a new workout routine you were trying out so you didn't hear Ryan when he entered. You were only alerted of his presence when he came into the bathroom jumping you a bit "Hey beautiful." Ryan said in a not so pleasing tone "Umm hey?" you said sitting up in the bath and watched your husband as he started pacing back and forth in the bathroom. He was wearing an orange t-shirt and dark jeans, looking fine might you add but now wasn't the time to focus on that. This is unlike Ryan, he always greeted you cheerfully and with a kiss every time he comes home, so something has to be wrong "I'm listening baby, what's wrong?" you gave him your undivided attention "Today was not a good day for me." he took a deep breath before continuing "First a parole officer I know was killed, then there was a mole in the lab, so FBI invaded our space and made our lives just a living hell. Having to be followed all day by them, then they were these questions, some were really personal, then Cooper ratted out to the FBI about me having keratitis -" you paused him "But babe, I thought your eyes were cleared, they're perfect." you said really confused "They are, but the other day, I just mentioned it to see who would rat me out, who would be the mole, and before you scold me I know it wasn't the smartest thing to do." "Once you know, continue." "so after I found out the FBI have that information and found out it was Cooper, I went for him, and confronted him." before you had time to interject Ryan reassured "Nothing serious, don't worry, but it did cause a scene because my blood was boiling, I apologize." you nodded "but even after that was cleared they kept coming to me, accusing me of stealing evidence money, because I was the last person to sign off on it, and no matter how much I tried to prove my innocence, the FBI would not get off my ass." you saw Ryan was starting to get heated again so you had to calm him down "Ryan, baby." he immediately stopped in his tracks and looked at you "You're getting worked up again. You're innocent, and they found the real culprit right?" you asked him and he nodded "Yeah, they did." "That's good, so you’re in the clear. Don’t allow the FBI to get under your skin anymore." you stared at him and saw his mind was whirling "Stop it." you scolded "But-" "No buts Ryan, stop. Don’t let the FBI best you." he sighed before finally making his way to you "You're right, it's taken care off." "Yes, now, would you like to join me?" you asked him with the sweetest smile you could muster and Ryan caved "Of course." he said returning a smile of his own and giving you a quick peck. Ryan quickly stripped of his clothes before taking a quick shower then joining you in the bath.

            He was currently sitting behind you in the tub as you lean against him, with his arms wrapped around your mid torso "Mind telling me about the officer that was killed today." you felt his arms tightened a little around you "His name was Jessop, when I was just leaving patrol, he was now starting. He was a really good guy." there was a hint of sadness in Ryan's voice when he spoke "I'm sorry to hear." you angled your head to look up to him to offer a condolence smile which he accepted and then placed a kiss on your lips. You returned back to your previous position relaxing back in his arms "This is nice." Ryan said causing you to giggle "What, soaking in a bath with your wife rather than thinking about the FBI?" "I couldn't have said it better myself." he said chuckling "I forgot to tell you but you would not believe the name of the FBI agent that was babysitting me." and you laughed because how hard would it be to guess the name "Her name was Heather wasn't it?" you felt him nod "I think it was utter punishment, giving me someone so evil with the same name as my wife, you know that had to be planned." "They really do play wicked." "You have no idea, today just really sucked." "Then enjoy your time here with me and forget all about them, and the day you had, be in the now." with that Ryan's arms tightened around your body and he leaned in to kiss your shoulder blade "You're right, the day is shedding away and being replaced with my with wife's naked body on top of me." that made you giggle "See, now isn't that way better?" "Way so much better."
