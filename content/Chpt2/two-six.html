            You were in the kitchen putting away dishes while Ryan was in the bedroom looking at some bank statements. After you were finished you joined him there and upon entering the room, you managed to hear him sigh "Frustrated?" you asked coming to stand behind him at the desk "You could say that. I just forgot how much I still owe on my student loans." you rubbed his shoulders trying to soothe him and he leaned back in the chair "You know I could always help you pay them off." you offered and he leaned back his head against your torso "You know I would never ask you to do that." "I know you won't but I'm your wife." and he sighed "I can't accept it because they're taking the payment from my paycheck, and if I just pay a bunch of money, that would be suspicious on my account." "Really, payments must be standard?" you felt Ryan nod "Wow, I didn't know that. So wait, how did you pay for the rings?" you felt Ryan tensed and an idea popped into your head "Don't tell me that was another loan?" he sighed "Would you scold me if I said yes?" you smacked his shoulder coming around to stand beside him leaning against the desk "Yes I would. Why did you do that knowing you're in debt?" he gave you a soft look "I wanted to marry you." and you sighed "We could of gotten married without the rings, and bought them when stable or you could of even asked me to buy them." "But that's the man's job" you rolled your eyes "So, I don't mind paying. At least at the moment let me help you pay for the rings." he shook his head about to protest but you stopped him "No, you can't stop me on this, I make more money than you, so let me help." and he sighed "It's the same standard payment process." "Right. Okay how about this, all bills and groceries, leave it all to me and you just focus on your loans, and going forward if you have to make any more payments on something consult me first so that I can help." you reached out your hand which he took  "I hate this, I'm the man, I should be the one looking after us." and you chuckled "Ryan, this is the 21st century, it doesn't have to be all you. Let me do this, just till you get back on your feet, I don't mind one bit." he pulled you to sit on his lap "Are you sure?" and you took hold of his face "Yes baby, I'm sure. We're in this marriage together aren't we?" he smiled in agreement "You're too good to me, and just perfect aren't you." "I try my best." "Thank you Heather." "Anything you need, I got you covered." he looked up at you and placed a sweet kiss on your lips which you returned. Pulling away you spoke "Don't worry too much okay." "Yes mam." Ryan's heart swelled at your gesture and what you're doing for him, and once again can't believe just how lucky he is to have you "So do you need help with anything else?" he shook his head "No, but you are distracting me." "I'm so sorry, let me leave you." you chuckled and Ryan laughed "Don't worry, it was a good distraction." and you rolled your eyes "Pervert, I'll be in the living room." you said leaving causing Ryan to laugh at the nickname "I'll join once I'm finished here." you gave a wave to signal you heard then exited the bedroom.

            "I'm tired adulting, I need my wife's love and attention now." you heard Ryan say entering the living room then plopped down onto the couch, head going immediately into your lap "Finished?" you asked bringing a hand to run through his hair "Yeah for now." he sighed getting more comfortable in your lap, and silence fell between you two. A random movie was showing on tv that you both were watching, when you heard Ryan spoke up "I forgot to tell you, that we're putting together money to donate to a children charity, would you like to help out?" he asked turning his head to look up at you "Of course. Are they accepting any amount?" "Yeah, why?" "I would like to donate a good set, it's for the kids." "Aren't you the generous type." Ryan chuckled "Of course, when do you need it for?" "You could write the cheque tomorrow before I leave." and nodded "Just remind me, because you know my memory sucks." "I know baby, I got you." "Thanks." you both turned back to watching tv just enjoying being in each others' company.
