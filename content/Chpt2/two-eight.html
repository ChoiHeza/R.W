      <p class="story">
        You were the first to wake and was still currently lying in bed watching
        Ryan sleep. He looked so peaceful and you knew he needed the rest after
        working twelve days straight so this off day was well deserved, and you
        both had made plans for the day and one of them was sleeping in, but
        your body is wired to wake up early no matter what, so not wanting to
        disturb Ryan you just watched him. Deciding that you would get started
        on breakfast for when he wakes up, it would be finished. You placed a
        quick kiss to his forehead, and then proceeded to get out of bed heading
        to the bathroom to wash up. After finished in the bathroom, you went to
        the kitchen and get started on breakfast. Twenty minutes later and when
        you were just about to finish up you saw Ryan enter the kitchen but
        instead of greeting him with a smile, you greet him with a sadden look
        "This is one time I don’t like seeing you in work clothes." you stated
        and he rest his bag on the counter before approaching you "Good morning,
        and I am so sorry." you sighed and mumbled a quiet good morning "So what
        happened?" "I just got woken up by a call saying to come in because Eric
        is a no show." you could see the annoyance in his eyes and you bet yours
        matched as well "Are you bloody kidding me right now. Ryan, this is your
        first off day after working twelve days straight." you just sighed, but
        you know it isn't his fault "I'm so sorry babe." "It's not your fault.
        Not starting to like Eric right now." and Ryan chuckled "So you're
        getting it." you gave him a knowing look with a nod, but then you
        grabbed his face and he responded with wrapping his arms around your
        waist "Do you really have to go?" you begged with your eyes and Ryan
        sighed before nodding "I really have to. It's a murder, but they
        promised to give me the next two days off." you leaned back and sighed
        before looking back to Ryan "Okay, go, although there is an unsettling
        feeling in my stomach right now that's saying chain you to a chair."
        Ryan chuckled "But I'm going to ignore it, because it's probably
        nothing. Just promise me you'll be safe as always okay, and come back
        home to me in one piece please." Ryan gave you a reassuring smile "I
        promise beautiful, I will return to you with all of me intact." your
        heart eased a bit at his words "Thank you." with that you pulled him in
        for a tender kiss "Want me to pack you some breakfast?" "Yes mam." you
        stepped out of Ryan's arms and packed it for him while he watched you
        "I'm sorry, we won't get to have breakfast together this morning, but I
        promise to make it up to you the next two days." you looked up and gave
        him a smile "I know you will." when finished you gave it to him and he
        placed it in his bag before you walked him to the door "Wait for me?"
        Ryan gave you a longing look taking hold of your face with his left hand
        "Always." with that he leaned in and gave you a goodbye kiss before
        leaving.

        Ryan got to work not happy, because it was supposed to be his day with
        you but he decided to suck it up and get the case out the way so he
        could get back home. He arrived to the scene to work with Calleigh and
        she was surprised to see him there "What are you doing here?" she asked
        when she saw him "Exactly. It was supposed to be my off day, after
        working twelve days straight but Delko was a no show." then Ryan made a
        remark about it but Calleigh said she didn’t want to get involved, so
        they both worked the case that day. 
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="story">
            Ryan and Calleigh arrived at the victims apartment to follow up on her ex husband's story. As they entered the apartment they found it in a little mess, with packing boxes everywhere. "Looks like Brenda downsized after the seperation." Ryan commented based on the size of the apartment "Injures says violence, her husbands says sex. Hopefully we can figure out what's true." Calleigh as they came to a stop looking around "Well, it's a fine line with some people." Ryan said "Broken fruit bowl. Looks like there was a fight." Calleigh pointed out making Ryan raise his camera to take a picture "Or it could be sex." Ryan started then paused to take a picture "Ever pushed aside a dinner plate to get some?" Ryan then asked with a raised brow looking towards Calleigh making her smile "You have?" she asked back "Have you seen my wife, kind of hard not to." Ryan commented with a smirk making Calleigh laugh with a shake of her head as they went back to processing the apartment.
        </p><br>
      <p class="story">
        Further in the day, Ryan got a call
        while still observing the crime scene "Hey Calleigh." "Hey, Ryan, are
        you still at the crime scene?" Ryan said yes and she asked him to check
        out something there. So heading to the trailer, he went looking and
        entering he heard a noise and kept his hand on the gun. He announced his
        arrival but no reply so he checked behind the first door, nothing but
        blueprints that made him jump but when he checked the second door, he
        got a surprise and was shot in the face with a nail gun taking him down.
        Quickly pulling out his phone, he reported 'officer down and needed
        medical help'. While Delko was on the road he heard the radio and went
        to the location. Getting Ryan he quickly drove him to the hospital,
        there was a lot of blood and Ryan was in so much pain but Delko told him
        to hang on. When they reached and Ryan was rushed into the emergency
        room Delko asked him if to call you but he said no, he doesn’t want to
        worry you and to call Alexx instead which Delko did. Alexx arrived and
        remained with Ryan through the whole process. She held his hand as the
        nail was removed, and after he was treated they just wanted to check him
        out to make sure everything was okay, and Alexx remained the whole time.
        While waiting, Alexx asked him "Ryan sweetie, why didn't you call your
        wife to be with you?" Ryan sighed before replying "This morning when she
        realized I had work, she had this gut feeling that something wasn't
        right and said if she could she would chain me to a chair." both Ryan
        and Alexx chuckled then he continued "And she was right. She's usually
        never wrong about these feelings, she's like you in a way with these
        feelings, so if she was called, the worst would be going through her
        mind and I didn’t want her to panic if she saw me with a nail in my eye.
        I prefer to go home and her see me bandaged where I can explain and
        sugar coat it." and Alexx smiled at him "Look at my baby, all grown up.
        Thinking about his wife while harmed." they both shared a smile "And
        that's good and all but just ask her, if this part of your life she
        wants to be a part of, and I have a strong feeling she'll say yes, but
        just talk to her." and Ryan nodded "Thanks Alexx, I have to bring her to
        meet you, I know you'll love her." "If she's married to you, I sure bet
        I will. How about when your eye is better, I'll have you two over for
        dinner, how does that sound?" "It sounds perfect, I'll run it by her and
        let you know." they both talked a bit more before a doctor returned to
        run more test. After hours of test, Alexx had to leave during to return
        to work and it was time for Ryan to be discharged, so leaving the room
        he saw Eric standing outside "What are you doing here?" Ryan asked and
        Delko kept apologizing saying this is all his fault. It was him that was
        supposed to be on that call, not Ryan but he reassured him constantly
        that it's not his fault and he's not to blame for it, so Delko listened
        to him for now, but deep down he still blamed himself "Is Heather coming
        for you, or do you need a ride?" Delko asked "I was just going to take a
        cab." "No, let me take you, I have to pass your direction either way."
        Ryan refused but Delko insisted "Please?" "Okay, you win." he chuckled,
        as they made their way out the hospital Delko asked "Would it be okay if
        I met Heather, I would like to apologize?" Ryan thought for a moment and
        laughed internally and it made its way outward "Sure, I bet she would
        like to meet you too." "The way you said that scares me." Ryan tapped
        Delko's back "She's tiny, don't worry about it, but just to be on the
        safe side, let's buy her flowers, because we had a day planned together.
        But... I got shot in the eye and you blame yourself for it all." Delko
        nodded agreeing "I'll stop at a flower shop along the way." with that
        they both left.
      </p><br>
      <p class="story">
        Since your plans for the day were ruined you spent the day working from
        home instead, and requested the next two days off, and before you know
        it, it was time for Ryan to come home, so you made sure to finish dinner
        in time and just waited. A hour passed and you started to get worried,
        because usually if he has to work late, he'll call and let you know, so
        you decided to give a call, just as you were about to reach for your
        phone you heard the apartment door opened "Hun, I'm home." a breath of
        relief left you "Babe, I was starting to get worr-" you said getting up
        heading to him but was cut off by one, his face and two, there was
        another guy with him "What the heck happened?" you said forgetting
        everything and immediately made your way to Ryan taking his face in your
        hands "It's not as bad as it looks. Was just a little accident, I
        promise." he offered you a smile but there was worry still written on
        your face so Ryan kissed between your bunched up brows to settle you
        "I'm fine beautiful, I promised to come back home in one piece didn't
        I." the smile he was giving you right now settled your heart "Okay, I
        will believe it for now because we have a guest, so who is this?" you
        asked turning to the guy standing behind Ryan offering him a smile "The
        name is Eric." he said while bringing flowers from behind his back
        presenting them to you, and your eyes turned into slits "So you're Eric
        Delko, hmmmm." you gave him a once over before taking the flowers from
        him with a thanks then got curious "Why the flowers? Is this for taking
        my husband away from me this morning?" you asked with a raised brow and
        Ryan stepped aside now with you completely in front of Delko looking up
        at him "Yes, and also the injury was my fault." your eyes hardened and
        you immediately got into a defensive stance and Ryan saw immediately
        what you were thinking so corrected quickly "No, he wasn't the one who
        did this to me. It was supposed to be his call, and he wasn't
        responding, but it's my fault. I should have been more aware." you
        looked between the both of them and sighed "I'm really sorry. That
        should have been me and I know I can't undo my mistakes, but going
        forward I will be better and I ask you to forgive me." you listened to
        him, and looked at the flowers he gave you then back to him and offered
        a smile "Okay Eric, you owned up to your mistakes, and I don't hold
        grudges. I forgive you." you opened your arms and offered him a hug
        which he accepted "There's no reason for me to be mad at you, plus you
        brought me flowers, and my favourite kind." you gave him a huge smile
        "Ryan told me what to get." he gestured to Ryan and he waved him off
        "Well thank you, would you like to stay for dinner?" you asked with
        puppy eyes and Delko couldn't say no to that "I would love to."
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="story">
        "Heather, I must say, you are not at all what I expected." you all
        laughed "You're not the only one. You should of seen when I met his
        uncle Ron, he was like, Ryan did you kidnap her. There's no way that
        she's with you." "Exactly! No offense to you Ryan, but after seeing
        Erika, I just thought you had a type, but clearly I was wrong." now you
        were curious "Now I'm curious, what did you think his type was?" there
        was a smile on your face with amusement "Blondes, basic, way taller than
        him, and stuck up. I just never understood what he saw in her, just not
        a fan." "I agree, I'm not a fan either, so then what do you think of
        me?" you asked curious "From the way Ryan talks about you, he made you
        sound like this holy being, someone perfect, and he would not shut up
        about how gorgeous you are, but after meeting you myself I can see, that
        his description didn't do you justice." you laughed looking towards Ryan
        "Thank you and I see what you mean with the smooth talking." you said
        first to Delko then turned to Ryan "You talk about me?" Delko asked "Who
        do you think gives me advice when we have our problems at work." you
        turned back to Delko "Don't worry, I'm always fair Like that one time he
        left you, I let him know he was wrong for that one." "Babe, you don't
        have to." "I'm just letting him know I'm a fair person." and Eric stared
        at the both of you. "Thank you for that Heather because I was surprised
        when he came an apologized, and that's when I found out about you." you
        guys chatted some more and you got to know Delko and he got to know you.
        Then it was time for him to go and he thanked you for dinner and told
        you how delicious it was. You told him he was welcomed anytime. He told
        you bye as Ryan walked him out "I really like her Ryan." "I hope not how
        I like her." "Of course not, she's definitely good for you. You got
        yourself a real one." "Thanks, I really do love her and sometimes I
        don't think I deserve her." they talked till they reach Delko's car
        "Thanks again, and I hope you get better soon. Once again, I'm sorry."
        "Thanks and it's okay, life happens. At least I get to spend some time
        home and rest." they both laughed at that, after a little more talking,
        Delko left and Ryan returned back to the apartment, to see you cleaning
        the dishes. "I'm back." after hearing his voice you stopped what you
        were doing and dried off your hands before coming to him. He sat on a
        bar stool while you went to stand in front of him. With it just being
        both of you now, you took a really good look at him now inspecting his
        eye. You sighed while taking his face in your hands "Does it hurt?" and
        he shook his head "Not at the moment but I guess that's because I'm on
        pain meds." your heart hurt seeing him like this. You were about to say
        something but he stopped you for a moment "Let's talk on the sofa." you
        nodded and he got up taking your hand leading you. You both sat down
        facing each other "Heather, when I said I'm fine, I really mean it." "So
        what really happened?" Ryan sighed before explaining it all too you "So
        why didn't you call me?" and Ryan smiled "Because I know my wife, and I
        know if she got a call like that she would of panicked and thought the
        worst of the situation. I prefer to come home and explain, than you see
        it." you gave him a look but he was right "I know but still. I would
        have liked to be there with my husband while he got a nail removed from
        his eye." he was about to protest but you cut him off "If it was me in
        that situation, I know for a fact that you would of wanted to be there.
        Am I right, or am I right?" you asked with a raised brow, and he
        chuckled before replying "You're right, I would of wanted to be there.
        Alexx did talk to me about this. That you would of wanted to be there,
        and that I should ask you if this part of my life you wanted to be
        involved in." you smiled widely "Of course Ryan, you're my husband. I
        married you, meaning all of you, the burdens you carry, the pain you
        carry, all of it I'm married to, so yeah, if my husband gets shot in the
        eye with a nail gun, I would want to be there." Ryan couldn't stop
        smiling at you, wondering how he got so lucky. He took a hold of your
        hand before replying "I promise, next time you'll be there." and you
        gave him a raised brow "Next time? There better not be a next time,
        that's the point." "You know what I mean babe." and you laughed nodding
        "I know what you mean, so Alexx, she sounds wise." "She really is. There
        are times she reminds me of you, always right, super wise, a people
        person that everyone can’t help but love." and you smiled at that "She
        sounds perfect, I would love to meet her." "It's funny you said that
        because she wants to meet you as well and has invited us over to dinner
        at her place for when I'm better. Would you like to go?" you grinned "I
        would love to go."
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="story">
        Ryan just got out the shower and with the towel wrapped around his
        waist, he was standing in front the mirror looking at his eye, thinking
        how lucky he was and that it could have been worst. You knocked on the
        door before entering and saw what Ryan was doing, his eyes met yours in
        the reflection of the mirror "What are you thinking about?" you asked
        approaching, hugging him from behind "How lucky I am to still be here."
        he went back to looking at his eye so you kissed his shoulder offering
        him comfort "And you know what really sucks about it? I can't see you
        fully with both eyes as I would like." and you chuckled "Ryan, you
        already know what I look like." "I know but I love seeing your gorgeous
        face every day, it keeps me going." he said looking at you through the
        mirror and your eyes went soft at that with a smile "You're so cute."
        you said hugging him tightly and he just chuckled "Well I don’t feel
        cute right now." "Well, in my eyes you are still adorable." he sighed
        going back to inspecting his eye "Come on Ryan, staring at it isn't
        going to make it any better." "I know, but a part of me can still feel
        the nail in there." you turned him to face you as you tiptoed to look
        closer at his eye "Let me see." he chuckled "You're too short." before
        you could protest, Ryan picked you up and placed you on the counter
        before coming to stand before you, and you got a better chance to look
        at it "May I?" you asked raising your hand and he nodded, so your finger
        touched lightly around the wound, then you took hold of his cheek
        bringing his face closer to place a light kiss on his injury. With that
        he released a sigh, pulling away you asked him "Would you like me to
        take a couple days off from work, to take care of you?" he thought for a
        moment before replying "As much as I would love that, I'm not going to
        ask you to take time away from work. I am still capable of doing things
        myself." you smiled at him giving him a quick kiss "My husband just
        rejected me but that's okay I guess." you said pretending to be hurt and
        Ryan chuckled "You know I would never. Honestly all I'm going to do is
        sleep and catch up on some rest, but, it would be cool if you maybe
        worked remotely once in a while, just so I can enjoy your presence." he
        said with a raised brow in the end "I can do it. Whatever you want." you
        brought your other hand up taking hold of his other cheek "Anything?" he
        asked with a glint in his eyes bringing his hands to rest on your hips
        and you nodded "Anything." "I was thinking, since I have some time home
        and I know you have the next two days home, maybe we could book a room
        with a balcony." Ryan words became slower at the end hoping you caught
        on and you just laughed "Sex on the balcony?" and he nodded immediately,
        a big grin making way to his face "Yes mam, plus I think I kind of
        deserve it, the getting away part I mean, I need a break from life." "I
        agree, my baby have worked so hard these past couple weeks, you do
        deserve it, and a little more." you wiggled your eyebrows and a hopeful
        look overtook Ryan's face "Can we get started on the little more
        tonight?" Ryan asked leaning in placing kisses along your neck, while
        pulling your body closer to his by your hips and you giggled "Sure, and
        we can make tonight all about you." you said pulling his face from your
        neck to crash your lips against his "I will not say no to that." he said
        amongst the kiss before taking it further, wrapping your legs around his
        hips before lifting you up and making way to the bedroom.
