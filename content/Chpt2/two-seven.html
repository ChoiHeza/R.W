        You and Ryan were currently in bed just laying down watching tv, but
        your mind was thinking a mile a minute. Ryan seemed to ask you
        something, but you didnâ€™t hear him and he realized so he asked a again
        before turning to look at you after he didn't get a response again. He
        realized that you were thinking something serious, so he tapped your leg
        and that broke you out of thoughts "Everything okay?" he asked with
        concern laced in his voice. You looked down in your lap before starting
        to tell him what's on your mind "How do you deal with victims that were
        raped?" his hand that was on your thigh, you felt it squeezed and he
        sighed before replying "First, it's not something easy because that's a
        pretty sensitive topic, but mostly if those victims are still alive, I
        won't deal with them, because they would feel more comfortable with
        another female." he tried to approach the topic gently "Do the cases
        seem to get easier as they go by?" and he shook his head "To me it never
        does because like I said it's pretty sensitive. That's why I usually
        don't tell you about those cases." you nodded understanding "Why the
        topic, did something happen?" he turned his body towards you and took
        your hands in his "No, nothing happened, it's just that that's a pretty
        deep fear of mine." his hands squeezed you tighter "Sadly that's one of
        mine as well. Whenever I get these cases, I always remember you, but I
        promise you Heather, I won't allow anything to happen to you." "I know
        you won't, with you I always feel safe." you brought your hands up to
        caress his cheek, just to let him know that he gives you comfort "Good."
        he gave you a smile and a kiss on your cheek before pulling you into his
        arms to lay on his chest as you both went back to watching tv.

        Your body was just about to fall into slumber when you felt an all too
        familiar cramp in your stomach, you just internally scolded, rolled your
        eyes and sighed "Babe you asleep?" you were currently still laying on
        Ryan's chest so you gave him a tap "Not yet, need something?" "I do
        actually. Could you please warm up some sweats and a pair of socks?" you
        said sitting up giving him puppy eyes and recognition over took his face
        "It just came?" you nodded getting up "Okay, I'll also get a heat pack
        for you." "You're a doll." he chuckled placing a kiss to your forehead
        before getting up "I'll be right back." he disappeared out the bedroom
        while you went to the bathroom. When finished you came back into the
        bedroom and saw Ryan was just entering with the clothes in hand "Here
        you go beautiful, warm out the dryer." you took them from him with a
        thanks and quickly put them on not wanting the heat to leave, and
        quickly got into bed "The pack should be finished by now so I'll go get
        it." he disappeared once again to get the heat pack and when he returned
        it was wrapped in a towel and he gentle placied it on your stomach. A
        sigh of relief left you when the warmth hit the sweet spot "Need
        anything else, pain killers or not just yet?" he asked and you nodded
        "Bring them, let's get ahead before the pain gets worse." you chuckled
        and he did as well before going to fetch them. Glass of water and pills
        in hand he gave them to you and you took them setting the glass down on
        the bedside table "That's it?" "Just need your cuddles now." you said
        with out reached arms which made him laugh "You got it." he got back
        into bed and pulled you into his side pulling you close while rubbing
        your back. "Thank you." you said looking up to him and he looked down
        with a smile "Anything for my wife." you reached up and kissed his lips
        before going back into his chest.
