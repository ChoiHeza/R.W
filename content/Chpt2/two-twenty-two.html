            You were passing the entry way when Ryan came in through the apartment door catching each other off guard "Hey babe!" "Hey, welcome home." you giggled turning back to meet him "Don't you look beautiful." you said referring to the green he was wearing "As always, it's for you." he said taking you into his arms, "Well thank you, it really is a sight." you tiptoed and connected your lips with his "Had a good day today?" he asked looking down at you caressing your cheek and you nodded "It was great, but I think it's about to get perfect." he raised a brow in question but you quickly jumped to wrap your legs around his waist and he caught you, before he could say anything you attached your lips back to his "Is it the shirt?" he asked in between kissing "I like the shade, and you wearing it turns me on." he smiled against your lips "Say less." then he deepened the kiss heading for the sofa.

            You were both currently in the bathtub sitting across from each other talking about Ryan's case from today "So it was the daughter?" Ryan nodded "Because it felt like her mother was getting taken from her. It was supposed to be their away time together." "I understand but she was so in the wrong for that, it's the mother's life, and if she really loved the guy, she loved the guy. Sometimes you just know the person that's meant for you when you meet them." when you said that Ryan looked at you lovingly "I understand that, the couple I mean. They literally just met and got married three days later." you made a gesture for Ryan to explain "For example, when I first met you, I don't know what it was but it felt like you were the one. I know it's cliché but it's just how I felt, no wedding bells sounded off but a part of me wanted you in my life every day." all you could do was stare at him with so much love and a smile tattooed on your lips. Ryan continued before you had chance to speak "And us being together just ensured that I wanted to do life with you till the very end. While we were dating, marriage did cross my mind multiple times but I just never knew when was the right time to ask, I kept wondering if it was too soon, are we still too young, would you reject me, but it was that night you put me in my place that my mind settled that made me buy the rings to ask you, because a normal girlfriend didn't behave the way you did, they were times you felt like my wife already so I was like it can't be that bad if I give you my last name, because it felt like we were already there. You don't know this but, that night when I decided to marry you I didn't had a time or day in place for when I wanted to ask you, I wanted it to be perfect, but then the next day after what happened with Hagan, I realized that life is too short, and I didn’t want to lose you, so I decided that I was going to go home and propose, and as you know, the rest is history." the heart eyes and smile would not leave your face. It just got wider with each word Ryan said "I never knew that." "I hope that wasn't a problem, not you getting a fancy proposal?" you shook your head "It was perfect. I wouldn't have wanted it any other way." that made Ryan smile wide, heart swelling recalling the memory "Come here." you moved forward in the tub and turned to sit in his lap, immediately he wrapped his arms tightly around you "Do you regret the events that have taken place in our lives till now?" "Not one bit. I know people say perfect doesn't exist but to me, this relationship we have, this love we have, it is perfect, we have our downs yeah, but to me it's perfect and I wouldn’t exchange it for anything in the world." Ryan leaned down and placed a kiss on your shoulder "Well my wife, you worded it perfectly." the love Ryan felt for you was real and amazing and made him feel so full and contented "So I take it no regrets from you." he chuckled "Not one and if given the opportunity to go back to the past and change something, I wouldn't, I would make the same choices all over again."  he gave your shoulder another kiss but a lingering one this time that made you hum in content "I love you Heather Wolfe." he said resting his head in your shoulder blade "And I love you Ryan Wolfe." you said leaning your head against his and you both meant the words that you spoke.
