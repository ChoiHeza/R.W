        You were currently in the kitchen cooking when you heard Ryan entered
        the apartment "Hey beautiful, I'm home." "I'm in the kitchen." you were
        in front the stove stirring the pot "Hi baby." you said seeing Ryan
        enter the kitchen and he greet you with a smile, making his way towards
        you "Hey you." he reached planting a kiss on your lips, "What are you
        making?" "Soup." you said and you both turned to the stove and when Ryan
        saw the pot, the colour drained from his face. Ryan remained quiet next
        to you making you look at him, and you saw the state he was in, he
        looked sick "Ryan, are you okay?" you asked stopping your stirring, and
        brought your hands to him "I need to sit down." he said moving away from
        you going to sit on a bar stool. You followed him concerned "Ryan you
        don’t look so good. Are you not feeling well?" leaning down to meet his
        eye level "It just reminded me of something from today." "What did?"
        "You cooking the soup, and the pot, it's all too similar." he was not
        making any sense "I am completely lost Ryan." confusion was written all
        over your face. You suddenly heard the pot starting to boil over so you
        ran over quickly to off the stove completely forgetting about it. You
        turned and faced Ryan watching him and saw that he was looking at the
        pot on the stove, with disgust and a hint of fear in his eyes "Is it the
        soup, does it smell bad?" but you don’t smell anything, if else it
        smells amazing, Ryan sighed before slowly coming back to his senses
        "Today, the other CSIs that I work with, Eric and Calleigh, they sent me
        to follow up on an autopsy that our M.E. Alexx was performing.
        Everything was normal, the body was covered over and she started with
        the limbs, then she pulled back the cloth to reveal the head, but
        instead the head wasn't there." he gulped recalling the memory "Where
        was it?" you asked intrigued "In a soup pot, in water, boiling." he said
        face in horror, then it registered, you looked back at the pot then to
        him, and everything made sense "Oh no." you said coming before him "I'm
        so sorry, I didn’t mean to make you relive that moment." you took his
        face between your hands and Ryan offered you a small smile "It's not
        your fault, you wouldn't have known." he then closed his eyes and you
        looked back to the pot then to him. Letting go off his face your made
        way to the stove and took the pot, being careful not to burn yourself,
        taking it to the sink getting ready to throw the contents away but Ryan
        halted you "What are you doing?" he asked getting up "Throwing away the
        soup." "Why?" "Because it made you sick and I don’t want you to relive
        something that traumatized you." you said with a shrug and you saw
        Ryan's eyes softened at your statement and he chuckled "Thank you babe,
        but let's not waste the soup. Let's just save it for tomorrow, I should
        be better then." you nodded "I can do that." you laughed and put the pot
        back on the stove and Ryan came over to you "You really are something.
        Things like this makes me love you more." he said bringing his hands to
        hold you at your waist "I try my best, to be an amazing girlfriend. So,
        what do you feel like eating then?" you asked him holding his forearms,
        he thought for a while before replying "Let's just go out and buy
        something. It's been a while." and you raised a brow "You just want to
        get away from the pot right?" and he quickly nodded making you laugh
        "You got it, let me just go and change." giving him a quick smile you
        broke away and headed for the bedroom.

        There was a park near where you guys lived that comes to life at night
        with food trucks of all kind so that's where you guys headed. You guys
        were walking hand in hand deciding on which truck to buy at "You pick,
        what are you currently craving?" you thought for a moment before
        replying "I could really go for a juicy burger right now" your response
        made Ryan chuckle "I could of guessed that." you shushed him as you both
        started to make a beeline to one of the burger trucks. Getting in line,
        you both order the usual and waited. After getting the meal you both
        found a place to sit and eat. After chewing Ryan looked up at you "I'm
        really sorry Heather." "What for?" you asked taking another bite "For
        not eating the soup you worked hard on cooking tonight." this was sorrow
        in his eyes. After swallowing you replied back "No need to apologize for
        that babe. That's completely okay." you reassured him but he still give
        you a look "It really is. Plus it's not like it'll go to waste. We'll
        use it tomorrow and you can carry some to work." you told him trying to
        hide your smile and horror appeared on his face "To soon." you laughed
        and he nodded. You guys continued to eat and talk just enjoying the
        atmosphere, and when finished you both took a night stroll allowing the
        food to digest while enjoying the night air, walking side by side
        intertwined hands swinging between you both.
