        "Hun, I'm home." you heard Ryan greeted entering the apartment, you got
        up quickly from the sofa coming to greet him "There he is, my favourite
        CSI." "You know other CSIs?" Ryan asked with a raised brow resting down
        his bag and taking off his shoes "Maybe." you said smugly approaching
        him "Going forward I'll have to keep an eye on you." he captured your
        face and planted a kiss on your lips "So how was your first official day
        as a CSI." you asked him reaching for his shoulders massaging them "It
        was very interesting. The victim was female and she was killed at a
        club, that one we visit a good while back with the fancy bathrooms."
        "Ahh, I know the one, that sucks." "Yeah, but being there for the full
        process of the victim than just handing it off to the CSIs, I got to see
        it from start to finish." you both started to make way to the sofa to
        sit "How did that make you feel?" "It felt real, that girl was killed,
        because a guy was jealous. It’s going to take some time getting used
        to." you took his hands in yours and gave them a squeeze "You'll get
        there, but I am very proud of you." you gave him a warm smile "Thanks
        babe. So are we still on for dinner tonight?" "Yes sir!" you said
        getting up quickly "I've already showered, so I just have to get
        dressed. Do you know what you're wearing?" he shook his head 'no'
        looking up at you "Maybe you can pick out something for me. You know I
        have no sense of fashion" he said with a chuckle and you joined "Okay
        okay, go shower and I'll take care of your clothes." "Yes mam" Ryan said
        getting up saluting.

        Ryan was finish dressed before you, He wore the clothes you picked out
        for him, and was currently in the living room waiting for you, while you
        were just finishing up your hair. Entering the bedroom you went in front
        the full length mirror to have a look over your complete outfit. You
        were currently wearing a tight red body shape dress that brought out
        your curves, it had straps and your back was out, black heels to match
        and your hair was down in braided singles. While making sure your outfit
        was perfect you heard a 'wow' from behind you "Wow… You look gorgeous."
        Ryan said making you turn to look at him, he was looking at you like you
        were his whole world "You don’t look bad yourself." he was wearing the
        white button up, with a black suit that you picked out for him "No, but
        look at you." Ryan said coming towards you and you turned to look back
        in the mirror as he joined you standing behind, resting his hand on your
        hip "No, look at us." while looking in the mirror Ryan just couldn't
        take his eyes off of you, and his other hand rested on your other hip
        and now he was standing fully behind you "You sure we have to leave
        home, because the way you look right now, I just want to keep you all to
        myself." he said bringing his lips to place kisses along your exposed
        neck "Ryan, yes we have to leave. We've already made reservations, plus
        we've promised that we would celebrate you becoming CSI tonight." you
        said turning in his arms halting his actions "You're right." he said
        with a sigh. You were about to lean up and kiss him but you stopped
        yourself remembering the lipstick "What's wrong?" "Just remembered I'm
        wearing the ring lipstick." you told him and he frown but you raised a
        brow at him "I thought you loved the ring lipstick. I can change it."
        you said starting to move away from him but he stopped you "No, you're
        right, I forgot." he said with a smirk squeezing your hips and you
        rolled your eyes "Pervert." "Well, it's not my fault that I find it
        completely sexy when your lipstick is smudged after we're making out."
        you slapped his chest moving away from him face full in blush and Ryan
        burst out laughing "Don't be shy baby, you know it's true." he said
        following you out the bedroom "I just thought you were going to say
        something else." "Like what?" Ryan asked curious "Nothing" you said
        shaking your head. You both now at the front door "Come on, tell me.
        What did you thought I was going to say?" Ryan pestered opening the
        front door, for you to exit first, but before doing that, you tiptoed
        and leaned into his ear whispering "That you found it sexy when my
        lipstick left rings on your.." and you looked down then back up at Ryan
        before leaving him there dazed, going through the door and starting to
        make your way down the hallway. Ryan was so caught off guard, it took
        him a while to process that you already left him. Quickly locking the
        door, Ryan ran to catch up with you placing a hand in the small of your
        back walking beside you, "I swear you're going to be the death of me."
        he said with a smirk and you looked up at him and saw his eyes were
        filled with lust so you returned a gorgeous smile of yours, the one you
        knows that makes him weak. You felt his hand dropped to your bum and
        squeeze "I can't wait to get you back home." he said placing a peck on
        your temple.
