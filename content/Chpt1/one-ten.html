            Originally you would have been coming home to Ryan because it was his off day, but an officer was killed and they needed all the hands they could get, so Ryan called this morning to let you know he was going in to work today. Entering the apartment, it was silent and you lowkey wished Ryan was here to greet you cause it's not every day that Ryan's here when you get home but the times that he is you look forward to them. Taking off your shoes and resting your bags down, you went to the kitchen and took out the menus to order in some food for when Ryan gets home, it'll be warm and all you guys have to do is eat. After placing the order you put away your stuff and way made to the bedroom, undressed then entered the bathroom to shower. While in the shower that when's Ryan arrived home. With his usual greeting, he heard nothing back and assumed you weren't home as yet cause he didn't see any of your belongings. While in the bathroom, you turned off the shower and stepped out, wrapping the towel around you and dry your feet before heading back to the bedroom. The meanwhile Ryan took off his shoes and made his way to the bedroom. You both entered the same time from different directions causing you both to jump. You bent over and clutched your chest while Ryan stood still and clutched his "Ryan!" you said standing back you "You scared me." "I scared you, you scared me." and you both laughed at the situation "I just assumed you weren't home when I didn’t hear anyone and saw none of your stuff." he said approaching you "and I thought you won’t be in for maybe thirty to forty-five minutes more." he leaned down and greeted you with a kiss apologizing "I'm sorry, things wrapped up early. Did you order already?" "I did, it should be here within thirty to forty-five minutes." "Ah, I see what you did." and he chuckled "Well I have time to shower then." you both stepped away going different directions, Ryan undressed and head to the bathroom while you went to the closet and got dressed.

            You were both in the kitchen sitting by the island eating and while talking about your day, Ryan just finished talking his case when he asked "I have a question. Have you ever been interested in a bad boy before?" it caught you off guard, it would have been random if you didn't know it was related to the case "Not in real life, maybe only from books." "Why not real life?" he was curious to know more "Because real life bad boys are actually really bad, like, illegal doings, super toxic, could honestly care less about you, and I can go on and on." "Not your cup of tea?" you shook your head "No, I like the really nice guys, the ones that shows up to your door in their police uniform and saves you from spiders." that reply made Ryan laugh "I like the sound of that type." "Of course you would." "What else about your type of guy?" you smiled before replying "Let's see, he must have no sense of fashion, officer become CSI, Justin Bieber haircut, gorgeous hazel green eyes, a mole above his cupid's bow, beautiful smile, short, but taller than me, super nice, likes to get the job done, no matter what it maybe, overall, great personality." you were smiling widely at him now and he was doing the same "He sounds like an amazing guy." "He's alright." and Ryan gasped "Just alright?" and you nodded before continuing "But more importantly, he's all mine." and pride instantly overtook Ryan's face "He sounds way better than any bad boy." and Ryan chuckled "So what's the hype then with liking bad boys?" "I guess the excitement that comes with him, running from the law, living an illegal life, committing crime together, etcetera." "I guess I can see it, would explain the teenage girl today." "Yup, and she loved a bad guy and look where it got them, him dead and she in jail." "I guess love makes you do crazy things." "It really can, I mean she killed for the guy, just so the officer would find out her age and separate them. It wasn't the smartest though, on her part." "It really wasn't" you guys just talked some more for rest of your meal.
