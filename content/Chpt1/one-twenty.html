            You were currently watching Ryan pace back and forth in the bedroom as you sat on the bed "You know I was actually going to apologize to him, but the way he's been acting towards me and always on my case, I don't think he deserves it." you were listening to Ryan as he rambled about another CSI, Eric Delko. "I get you, but in the end I still think you should apologize, and he should as well, and if he doesn't, let that rest on his heart, because at least you apologized, you became the bigger man. Plus he's clearly trying to get under your skin and it seems to be working." "It's not that easy Heather, it's the way he talks to me, of course I can hold my own, but sometimes it gets so irritating." Ryan sighed "I understand and I'm not asking you to ignore him, just ignore his behaviour and remarks towards you and just focus on your work and process evidence, whatever it is you do, because I know you Ryan, if this goes on any further you both will throw hands, and I don’t want you getting in trouble at work, especially being new to the CSI team, cause if they had to get rid of one of you guys, trust me, it would be you. So please, I'm begging you, settle this feud between you two, and be professional and keep putting your best foot forward, cause this is your dream job babe, and don’t let anyone take this from you." he stopped pacing now and was standing still with his hands on his hips looking at you and he sighed "You make it sound so easy." "Because it is that easy Ryan. You just have too much pride and you know it." he gave you a look and you gave him one right back "Don't give me that look, you know that I'm right, and you know I will sit here and put you in your place and tell you when you're wrong." he looked up then looked down releasing a sigh "As much as I hate to admit it, you're right." "And that's the pride speaking, so bloody swallow it and apologize, cause clearly giving my opinion earlier did jack shit, because look how the situation has gotten, worse." you were standing in front him now and you saw he was having an internal battle in his head "Listen to me when I said I'm not putting you wrong, I just don't want things to get completely out of hand and you losing your job, got it." he stared intently before nodding finally blinking, you brought your hands to take hold of his face "If you come home tomorrow and I heard you didn't apologize, I will be extremely pissed." "What if he's even being more of a dick?" "Then you will still apologize and leave the ball in his court, cause you would have done your part." he sighed then nodded bringing his hands to capture your hips and you brought yours to his chest "Okay, I will, because as always you are right, and I wouldn't want to lose my job, because of pride." "Thank you." you offered him a smile which Ryan returned and placed a quick kiss to your forehead. "Now I'm going to go and get started on dinner." you said then reached up and placed a kiss to his lips before stepping out his arms leaving the bedroom. "Okay, let me know if you need any help." "Yes sir" he watched you leave, but remained rooted in his spot, thoughts playing over in his mind. The way you talked to him just now, made him realized something, you actually really do care for him, well he knew that already, but like this felt different and it also made him realize that he wants to do this with you, he wants to live life with you, as long as you both are here on earth. His last thought being very certain, he wants to spend the rest of his life with you, he wants to marry you. There was no doubt in his mind now, it's concrete, he going to ask you to marry him. A smile graced his face at the realization. "I'm going to marry her." he said quietly to himself, before leaving the bedroom to join you in the kitchen, to help with anything you may need.
