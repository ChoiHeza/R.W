            You were currently in the living room watching the news while sipping on your morning coffee. "I really hope we live far enough inland." you said voicing your concerns, cause they were talking about the tsunami warning issued through out Miami "We do babe, I made sure that you'll be safe here." Ryan said coming from the kitchen "And what about you, will you be safe out there?" you asked as he sat next to you "I don't have much of a choice, or you'll kill me." he chuckled but you still gave him a worried smile and before he could of replied to put your heart at rest your phone rang "Hello." you said answering "Hey Heather, sorry for calling so early, but we're asking the heads to come in and help secure the place. I know we're high and inland but upper up orders." Brady's voice came through the phone and you could hear the sigh in his voice and you chuckled at that "Don't let them get to you Brady, I've got your back. I'll be there." "Thank you so much Heather, you're best. See you soon, bye." "Bye bye" you then hung up and could feel Ryan's eyes on you, so you looked at him "What was that?" he asked with an idea already in mind but hoping it was wrong "I have to go into the office and help secure." you said shyly and Ryan closed his eyes not liking what he heard and sighed "I was hoping that didn’t had to happen." "I know." you said starting to get up "Is it a must to go?" "Yeah it is, they want all the heads to go." you made your way to the kitchen and Ryan followed "What if I chain you to the apartment?" and you laughed "You can't do that Ryan." "Watch me." he said with a raised brow and folded arms while you washed your cup. "I just have to get there early and back home before the worst happens, plus we're inland so it shouldn't be that bad." "Babe, you know how Miami gets, the traffic becomes ridiculous." after washing your cup you approached him "I have an idea." you suggested "I'm listening." he said bringing his arms to wrap around your waist "What if you use your badge, to get me there quickly and back home?" you raised a brow hoping it would work Ryan thought for a moment "It would be considered an emergency." you interjected before he replied "I like it, because that way I'll know you're safe and out of harm's way." he smiled down at you, liking the thought so you leaned up and placed a kiss on his lips "So that's a yes?" and he nodded it heads "Let's get ready, so I can hurry and return you home." you both laughed.

            "Okay babe, just wait right here while I go and sign in." Ryan said before you got out in front the station and you gave him an okay. It was a 7 minute wait before he returned with the hummer and you got in, heading off to your work place. "I have two hours before I am officially needed so that's more than enough time to get you there and home." you just couldn’t help but smile to yourself and Ryan caught you "What are you smiling at?" he asked "You." "Me? What did I do?" you turned to look at him "By being the sweetest boyfriend ever. Using his officer slash CSI status to make sure his girlfriend is safe the entire time." your smile got wider at the end. Ryan reached across his hand to grab yours "I'm only doing what should be done, plus I have the power so why not use it to make sure my baby is safe." he said bringing your hands to his lips to leave a kiss and that made you blush "You always know how to make me love you more." and that made a grin appear on Ryan's face "Anything for you." "Stop, or my cheeks will fall off from blushing and smiling too much." "Never." he said with a chuckle and you just shook your head. Within record time, Ryan reached your office and you both rushed up to your floor to get started on the task at hand "Glad you could make it Heather, and you brought reinforcements, sweet." Brady greeted and gave his instructions on what he wanted you guys to do, and you both got to work. They were 6 people there in total, excluding you and Ryan so you managed to get everything done with one hour and fifteen minutes. "Thanks Ryan, for helping out." Brady said "Anytime." Ryan replied. You told everyone bye and wished them all safety before exiting the building with Ryan "Would you look at that, with forty five minutes to spare I can get you home and back to work." Ryan said proud of himself "You did good." you rewarded him with a peck on the cheek.

            Ryan reached the apartment complex and you both got out because you had some stuff from work to take home, so Ryan said he'd helped you take up the stuff then head off to work. Ryan rest down the box and unlocked the door, then you both entered. He rest the box on the table before turning to you "Okay babe, I got to go." he took you by the waist bringing you into him "Promise me you'll be safe, because it's going to get crazy out there." you said looking up at him massaging his arms up and down "I promise, I'll return home to you in one piece." he then leaned in and left lingering kiss on your lips before pulling apart "I love you." "and I love you. Be careful" "Always." he said placing a kiss to your forehead before leaving. You turned to your box and decided to put them away to keep your mind occupied, and then decided to get some work done. Engrossed in your work you heard your phone ringing, so reaching for it you answered after checking the ID "Hey, uncle Ron, what's up?" it was Ryan's uncle that lived in the city "Hey hun, is Ryan with you?" "No he isn't, why?" "Can you call and tell him, that I'm safe where I am. I've lived through hurricanes." and you just sighed, Ryan always told you how stubborn he was and you've seen it for yourself a couple times already "Uncle Ron, are you home?" "Yes I am, and tell him that I'm perfectly fine." "Don’t you think it would be best if you found higher ground?" there was silence on the other before he replied "You think that would be wise?" "Yes Uncle Ron, I think it would be." "Okay, I'll go, only because you're my favourite." that made you smile "Thank you. Now be safe." "I will be hun, and the same to you, I've got to go. Bye" "Bye Uncle Ron." you heard him hung up and decided to call Ryan, because it's Uncle Ron for goodness sake, although he said he'll leave, he might change his mind last minute and do the opposite.

            Ryan was currently at the station helping out with securing the equipment, they were further enough inland but it was still precaution. He was just putting tape securing a box he just finished packed when he felt his phone vibrate. Taking it from his pocket he saw it was you, which is weird because you never call when he's at work unless it's really important, so he hoped nothing happened to you "Hey love, something wrong?" "No I'm fine, but I'm calling about Uncle Ron." and Ryan sighed having an idea "He hasn't left has he?" "No he didn’t but I told him to, and he said he would but it's Uncle Ron." Ryan understand "Yeah, he goes and does the opposite sometimes." you sighed "That's what I'm afraid off." "Okay, I'll call and then go check on him. Thanks babe." "Always, please be careful, the time is drawing near and he lives right there on the coast." "I know, I'll be careful." "Keep me updated." "I will." Ryan hung up and started to make his way to the elevator while calling Ron but he was getting no answer. Seeing it about to open he rushed to catch it and out came Calleigh the same time "Heading home?" she asked with a box in hand "No, I was helping out when I got a call. You see I have this stubborn uncle that's refusing to evacuate." Ryan sighed and Calleigh smiled at understanding "Tried calling him?" "I did, but I'm not getting a response, so I'm just making that he's actually gone." "I understand, I'll let H know." "Thank you." she offered a smile before leaving and Ryan pressed the button on the elevator. Arriving by his uncle he knocked and heard nothing, then entered the code to enter his apartment "Uncle Ron!" Ryan called out, but he got no response, Ryan released a sigh of relief "He listened for once." he said to himself and was about to leave when someone else came into the apartment, and they greeted each other "You must be Ron's nephew." the lady said "Yes mam, I am. What are you doing here, shouldn't you have evacuated?" Ryan questioned her and she waved him off "I think these people are just making a fuse, it's not going to be anything major." and Ryan gave her a look "Mam, you should of still heed the warning, just in case." before she could reply they heard the roar of the ocean and both made their way to the window "Th sea shouldn’t go that far back." she said with fear now laced in her voice "No it shouldn't." Ryan told her then looked towards her to she see was already staring back "I think we should get out of here." so Ryan took hold of her and calmed her "We're going to stay right here, we should be safe." and that what they did, stayed right where they were, through the whole thing.

            You were watching the news when they mentioned that the tsunami hit and you hoped that Ryan and Uncle Ron were safe. Ryan was supposed to call back but you haven't heard from him, so worry slowly started to settle in. After the tsunami went back out Ryan got a call and was expecting it to be you but it was Uncle Ron "Uncle Ron, where are you, are you safe?" "Yeah I'm safe, your girlfriend, Heather, talked some sense into me." a proud smile appeared on Ryan's face "She has a talent for persuading people. Where are you?" "On the roof, she told me to get to higher ground." "The roof! I don't think that's what she meant when she said higher ground." "You don't know that Ryan, but I do need help with something." "What is it?" "The door to the roof is locked so I'm trapped up here." and Ryan sighed "I'm coming." he hung up and looked to the woman with him "I have to go help my uncle, it was nice meeting you." "You too sweetie, thank you." "Anytime." and Ryan left heading to the roof. After helping his uncle Ryan got called out to a crime scene but before doing that he made a call to you to settle you worried heart "Ryan, I was starting to get really worried." you said answering the phone and he chuckled "I'm sorry for worrying you love, but Uncle Ron is safe, he was on the roof." "That's not what I meant when I told him higher ground." and you sighed "I told him that, but you know how he is." you chuckled "Work begins for you now?" "You know it, I'm about to head out to a scene so I'll see you when I come home." "Okay, baby, once again be careful and I love you." "Yes mam, and I love you too, bye." "Bye bye." then you hung up and returned back to what you were doing.

            It was evening when Ryan returned home and he found you vacuuming and he had an idea why you were doing it. "Hey, you're finally home." "Yeah. Stress cleaning?" Ryan asked taking off his shoes "What gave me away?" you asked shyly turning off the vacuum. "You vacuumed last night, and that's not due till another 4 days." he approached taking the machine from your hands "Sorry, mind was spiraling." "No need to apologize, I understand. Want to talk about it?" and you shook your head "Nah, it's nothing serious, just work." looking up at him and he brought you into his embrace, enveloping you into a bone crushing hug. "Once you're good. But I've seriously missed you today." you hugged him back tightly "I've missed you too." you buried your face in his chest and hummed in content "Can we just stay like this forever?" "We can, but sadly our feet will give out before us." you both chuckled "Stupid feeble human body." Ryan sighed "Hungry?" you asked leaning back to look at Ryan "Yes please, what did you cook?" and you released another sigh smile before replying "I may have stressed cook also." "So that means you cooked a whole feast?" and you nodded "A Bajan Sunday dish special, rice, chicken stew, macaroni pie, coleslaw, potato salad, normal salad and fried chicken." Ryan looked impressed "This is what you guys would eat every Sunday?" "Yes sir, so let's get you filled up." "One of these days you're doing to make me fat." "I won't. I promise." you leaned up and gave him a quick kiss before pulling away and heading to the kitchen.

        <p class="story">
            "Is it legal to do that?" you asked Ryan as he talked about today's case "It isn't, but they were trying to cut corners." you shook your head "Some people think, just because you're dead, it doesn't matter what happens to your body." "That's why I've chosen to be a CSI, so after death, they're respected." "And that's very sweet of you." you gave him a proud smile "Who would of thought, that after a tsunami you would be working on a case with a cemetery involved." "Well it was because of the tsunami that their sketchy business was caught. But Alexx and I made sure that the girl got a proper burial in the spot she belonged." "It's things like this that makes me very proud of you. Getting very involved and making sure you see it through to the end. That the justice is served." you said giving him a wide smile "Just doing my job." "Well you're doing above and beyond." you rubbed his upper arm "You know it's who I am." "I know Ryan, you're too good for this world, that's why I'm dating you and not some other random man." "I can honestly say the same for you." he looked into your eyes sincerely and you pretended to flip your hair over your shoulder "I know I'm the best." and Ryan laughed "You really are, and I'm not joking." "Come on Ryan, can't you just play along as well? Going to make me feel all hot and blushy. You know I don’t handle these compliments well." you said avoiding his gaze starting to get up but Ryan grabbed hold of your wrist pulling you back, causing you to land on his lap. And you brought your hands up to hide your face, but Ryan took them away capturing them in his own hands so you did the next best thing and hid your face in his shoulder blade and you just heard him laughing at you. "Ryan stop." "No Heather, I will not. You need to constantly know how loved you are, how amazing you are, how beautiful you are, how lovely you are, all the positives that you are. I will never shut up about them." you sighed and looked up at him, all you could do was smile not knowing what to say, so all you did was connect your lips with his "I love you Ryan." "And I love you Heather." he gave you an eye smile before connecting back his lips with yours.
