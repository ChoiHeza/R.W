            You were currently cleaning the kitchen when you got a call from Ryan telling you that he has amazing news to share with you. Many things just kept running through your mind as to what this news could be. You didnâ€™t even realize there was a permanent smile on your face. You were wiping down the counter when you heard the front door open and then followed a very loud Ryan "Heather, babe! Where are you?" "Kitchen" you heard him hurrying to where you are with everything in hand. When he entered you saw he had the biggest grin on his face, and he dropped all his things on the counter halting you from what you were doing. "Someone is clearly very excited" you stated "You have no idea." he said coming to stand right in front of you "So are you going to tell me the big news or do you want me to guess?" "I want you to guess." he couldn't keep the smile from his face, you nodded an okay and inspected him and his surroundings and something finally registered in your mind "You're not wearing your uniform and you have it on a hanger." you thought some more "It can't be that you got fired because that wouldn't have made you happy, so.." Ryan nodded and gestured his hands towards you to get there faster, then it all clicked "You got promoted to CSI?!" you quickly exclaimed with excitement "Yes!" Ryan joined and he lifted you up for guessing correctly, with his arms around your waist and yours around his shoulders you leaned in and gave him a congratulation kiss "You're really CSI?" you asked again still not believing it "Yes baby. I really am CSI, I did it." they were wide grins on both your faces at the joy you both were feeling in this moment. Ryan crashed his lips against yours spinning you around. His life was playing out just the way he wanted it to and that made him very happy, and he's getting to share it all with you and that makes him even happier. Ryan placed you down, but you kept your hands on him bouncing up and down with joy "You have to tell me everything, how it all happened."
