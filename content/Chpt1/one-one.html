        You were currently cleaning the kitchen when you got a call from Ryan
        telling you that he has amazing news to share with you. Many things just
        kept running through your mind as to what this news could be. You didn’t
        even realize there was a permanent smile on your face. You were wiping
        down the counter when you heard the front door open and then followed a
        very loud Ryan "Heather, babe! Where are you?" "Kitchen" you heard him
        hurrying to where you are with everything in hand. When he entered you
        saw he had the biggest grin on his face, and he dropped all of his
        belongings on the counter halting you from what you were doing. "Someone
        is clearly very excited" you stated "You have no idea." he said coming
        to stand right in front of you "So are you going to tell me the big news
        or do you want me to guess?" "I want you to guess." he couldn't keep the
        smile from his face, you nodded an okay and inspected him and his
        surroundings and something finally registered in your mind "You're not
        wearing your officer uniform." you thought some more "It can't be that
        you got fired because that wouldn't have made you happy, so.." Ryan
        nodded and gestured his hands towards you to get there faster, then it
        all clicked "You got promoted to CSI?!" you quickly exclaimed with
        excitement "Yes!" Ryan joined and he lifted you up for guessing
        correctly, with his arms around your waist and yours around his
        shoulders you leaned in and gave him a congratulation kiss "You're
        really CSI?" you asked again still not believing it "Yes baby. I really
        am CSI, I did it." they were wide grins on both your faces at the joy
        you guys were feeling in this moment. Ryan crashed his lips against
        yours spinning you around. His life was playing out just the way he
        wanted it to and that made him very happy, and he's getting to share it
        all with you and that makes him even happier. Ryan placed you down, but
        you kept your hands on him bouncing up and down with joy "You have to
        tell me everything, how it all happened."

      <p class="story">
        You were both sitting on the sofa when Ryan got to telling you how it
        all started "As you know this morning, I went in with the idea of
        applying to join CSI, and I guess someone put in a good word for me when
        Lieutenant Caine asked to speak with me." you held up your hand pausing
        him "Wait, the Horatio Caine?" you asked super excited "Yes, the Horatio
        Caine asked for me." smiles not leaving both your faces and you gestured
        for him to continue "So when I met with him he asked me questions, then
        he asked to see my firearms and I showed him." "I bet he was impressed
        because I know you clean and maintain them more than once a week" Ryan
        did a face at what you said making you think otherwise "I mentioned I
        had OCD but he didn't comment on it and that dispirited me for moment,
        thinking I've blew it, but he asked more things and gave me the paper
        work to get started on." "You can never be too careful when handling
        firearms and I'm very proud of you for keeping them maintained." you
        told him with a proud smile which he agreed to, then he continued "While
        I was filling out the paperwork Horatio called me over and said he has a
        case for me." "So soon, but you weren't official yet and you worked on a
        case?" you asked excitement laced in your voice "Yes mam." he said very
        proudly "I guess it was to prove what I was capable of. A guy thought he
        killed someone but he wasn't sure so I had to prove he didn't do it."
        "And did you do well, on your first case?" "Yes I did and I enjoyed
        myself. I definitely love being a CSI." you were so proud of him, he
        worked really hard to get here and he deserved it "You know how proud I
        am of you right now. You did it Ryan, or should I say CSI Wolfe" you
        told him capturing his face between your hands looking at him with such
        pride "I should thank you, you kept me going, to not give up." "No baby,
        this was all you, I just gave a little nudge." you said with a nudge of
        your shoulder making Ryan chuckle and closed in the distance between you
        two and gave you a tender kiss. He grabbed your hips bringing you to sit
        on his lap deepening the kiss "Should we go out and celebrate?" you
        asked between the kiss "That sounds nice, we should get dinner, I
        haven't eaten all day." Ryan said pulling away and you sat up and gave
        him a look "What do you mean? I gave you lunch today, a roast beef
        sandwich. Was it not good?" you asked him and he started to rubbed your
        thighs up and down "I would have to ask the gator I fed it too. I bet it
        was delicious." he said and you gave him the most puzzled look "While at
        the crime scene looking for the murder weapon, I came across a gator and
        wanted to get where he was so I used the sandwich as a distraction to
        draw him away and it worked." you looked at him amazed "You encountered
        a gator today and how did you not think to mention that to me." you said
        smacking his chest "It slipped my mind, I was too caught up in the
        excitement of working the case." he told you with an apologetic smile
        and you just shook your head "Now we really have to go out and eat." you
        said getting up "Where are you going?" Ryan asked watching you "To go
        get ready, we gotta celebrate and you gotta eat." you said making your
        way to the bedroom and Ryan got up "But I want to have some fun first,
        after all I am CSI now." he approached lifting you up and placing you
        over his shoulder with a smack to your bum heading off to the bedroom

        You guys just finished showering together and you were currently
        standing in front the mirror with only your towel wrapped around your
        waist doing your hair. Ryan left you in the bathroom while he went to
        the bedroom to look for clothes to wear. While looking into the mirror
        you saw him entering back the bathroom in just a pair of boxers "What
        happened, gave up on looking for clothes?" you asked him looking back at
        your reflection "Not really, but I don’t feel like going out anymore."
        he said coming up behind you, wrapping his arms around your waist and
        slowing feeling up your chest while he placed his head into your neck
        inhaling your scent and leaving kisses behind, so you stopped what you
        were doing "Want to just order in then or do you want me to cook you
        something?" you asked him while leaning your head to the side to give
        him more access to your neck "I want the third option." "Which is?" "To
        eat you all over again." "Real food this time Ryan." you giggled,
        scolding him so he lightly bit you in your neck and replied "Fine, let's
        order in. That way I can have you as an appetizer until food arrives."
        he said smugly so you turned in his arms looking up at him "You don't
        give up do you." he shook his head no lifting up and placing you on the
        counter standing in between your legs "How could I when I have the most
        gorgeous and delicious woman as my girlfriend." "Aren't you the sweet
        talker." bringing your hands up to wrap around his neck "Only for you."
        he was about to lean in but you stopped him "Shouldn't we at least order
        the food first?" you raised a brow at him and he chuckled "You're right.
        Stay right there and do not move." you raised your hands in compliance
        "Yes sir." "The usual?" he asked leaving the bathroom looking at you and
        you gave him a nod, he want and placed the order before returning back
        to you "Now where were we." he said coming back to you and taking you
        within his embrace placing his lips back on your body.
