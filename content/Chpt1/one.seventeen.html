            Before on his way home, Ryan stopped by a florist to get some flowers for you, because of how today made him felt, being lucky to have you in his life, also knowing that you're going to scold him for what he did and last but not least he just felt like giving you extra loving, knowing that you're cared for and is safe with him. So standing outside the apartment door, he released a heavy sigh before entering. "Hey babe?" it came out more like a question, and he didn’t get a reply, but your shoes were at the door, so you were home just probably out of earshot. Taking off his shoes, resting down his bag and with flowers in his hand he went to search for you. Heading for the bedroom he opened the door entering and saw that you were currently in bed sleeping, still wearing your working clothes. He assumed you must have had a really long day, to just come home and dropped sleep, he smiled to himself at your cute form. Not wanting to wake you just yet, Ryan moved quietly throughout the apartment. He got a vase for the flowers and set them beside the bath tub on the table and then turned on the water to run you a bath because he knows after days like this you love taking relaxing baths while listening to him talk about his day. Returning to the bedroom, Ryan lay beside you to gently wake you up. You felt someone shaking your shoulders bringing you from your nap to open your eyes. Squinting you saw it was Ryan before closing them back "Hey hun, just got in?" you asked slowly waking yourself up "Somewhat, I see you've had a long day." he said with a chuckle referring to you still wearing your working clothes so you just sighed and nodded "I figured as much, so I'm currently running a bath for you." your ears perked up at that "Ryan Wolfe, you beautiful amazing man, I could kiss you right now." you said with a lazy smile and he laughed "Let's get you up." he said helping you get up into sitting position and you immediately wrapped your arms around his neck "Hi." he smiled "Hey you." and offered you a tender kiss "You got it from here? I have to check the water." you nodded. He left you and returned to the bathroom, meanwhile you got up and shed your clothes. "It's ready." he said so you headed his direction and got in allowing the warm water to envelope you making you release a long sigh. After getting settled you opened your eyes and saw flowers on the table "What's with the flowers?" "I bought them for you." you leaned forward to inspect them and graze your hand over them "Thank you, they're beautiful. Special occasion?" he shook his head pulling the bench to sit beside the tub as you leaned back "No, just want to get you flowers, they kind of hold several meanings behind them." you raised a brow "I'm listening." and so Ryan began telling his day to you.

            He first told you about the main crime scene and the female victim found "Wing chick? This is new and low key clever." "I thought so too." "Miami really have a company for everything." you laughed and Ryan agreed "Want to hear the funny thing about it?" "What?" "They don't take ugly clients, something along the lines of they’re not miracle workers." "Gosh that's harsh, and a business like this is legal?" "Pretty much." and you just shook your head. Ryan continued talking about the case and reached the point with Valera and he sighed "What, something went wrong?" "I may or may not have looked at something that caused a co-worker to get suspended." you sat up at that "Explain Ryan." "A lab tech, Valera, she made a mistake on something and when she realized she told me to get out the room and to don’t look at the file." Ryan sighed and you continued for him "But knowing you, you didn’t leave the room right away and looked at the file anyway." Ryan lowered his head "Ryan Wolfe, you had one job, and that cost someone their job." you were disappointed and he felt it "I am going to do everything in my power to get her back." "You don’t have a choice Ryan." you said looking away from him and your eyes managed to land on the flowers, so you pointed at them "So that's what these were for?" you gave him a stern look and he hesitated before answering "Maybe." you sighed and was about to say something else but he stopped you "I know, it's wrong but they also mean me showing appreciation to you, of how lucky I am to have you by my side and that you're safe with me and I would never do anything to hurt you, that I will always take care of you" you sighed, your heart lightened a bit at what he said but he was still wrong "I understand, but then promise me one thing." "Anything" "Going forward, when you're told to do something, do it, especially if another co-workers career depends on it. Got it?" he nodded "I understand, won't make the same mistake twice." "You better not Ryan." you then leaned back in the tub and closed your eyes. Ryan felt really bad but you were right. What he did was wrong, and he felt like he let you down somehow. You could feel the hurt radiating from Ryan so you reached out your hand for him to take, which he gladly did "Just know this doesn't make what you did okay, but I know you enough to know that you've already beaten up yourself about it already and you're going to do all you can to make it right" you offered a smile "Thank you." and that's what Ryan will do, he hates knowing he's let you down, so he's going to make it right.
