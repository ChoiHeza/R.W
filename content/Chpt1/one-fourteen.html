        You and Ryan were currently out on your balcony area enjoying the
        evening breeze, it's not often that you guys get to go out here, but
        when you do, it always a really nice atmosphere. "Why don't we come out
        here often?" you asked turning your head to Ryan and you saw he was
        admiring the view "I don't know. I guess we're always just really busy."
        you nodded turning back to the view "We should make it more of a habit."
        "When you think of it there is a lot of things we don't do often enough
        that we should be doing?" "Like what for example?" you thought for a
        moment "Sky diving." and Ryan burst out laughing looking towards you
        "Babe, you want to go sky diving often?" "It would be nice to try." "Now
        I know you're lying, you're afraid of heights." Ryan said turning back
        to look at the view "I know. It was worth a shot." you laughed and then
        there was quietness amongst you guys again "What about a charity event?"
        you turned to look at him and saw he was already looking at you "That
        sounds nice. We could do that and donate money. How did you think of
        that?" "Today, our victim ran charity events for runaway girls." "Did
        you get to witness one of the events by any chance? Does she hold
        dinners or auctions?" "Neither actually, today I saw a bunch of women in
        their bikinis." you looked confused "I'm lost, what exactly was the
        event?" "It was a bikini modal show, which is honestly a weird way to
        raise money in my opinion." you hummed "Didn’t expect that. Were they
        all gorgeous?" you asked Ryan as a joke, watching him intently putting
        him on the spot, and he started to mumble with his words and you tried
        so hard to hide your smile by biting your lip "So Ryan, were they?" the
        smile starting to escape and Ryan caught on "Were you trying to set me
        up?" you shrugged your shoulders releasing a big smile "It's okay to say
        they were gorgeous Ryan. I don’t mind, just once you were looking
        respectfully." he nervously swallowed "Of course I was, majority of the
        time." and you gasped "Ryan Wolfe, you checked out those women?" "Not
        like that. Not in a perverted, sexual, or an interested in them kind of
        way. Yes they were beautiful but you are the only woman that catches my
        eye." he looked so nervous when he was finished explaining himself. You
        folded your arms and gave him a look "Nice save Ryan." "Are you mad?"
        you smiled towards him releasing your arms "No Ryan, nothing is wrong
        with looking. I do it all the time." now it was his turn to give you a
        look "Excuse me? You check out other guys?" he asked with a raised brow
        "Both guys and women actually, but not in a perverted, sexual, or an
        interested in them kind of way." you said relaying Ryan's words back at
        him "It’s a human thing to do, just don't go about it in a way that
        seems like cheating." he was still staring at you not saying anything
        "What?" you asked "It's just that I get it, coming from a different
        perspective. Knowing that you do it as well just hits different. Low key
        a little jealous, but I get it." Ryan said with understanding and you
        chuckled "We cool?" you held out your fist to him which he connected
        with his own "We cool." and you both laughed at the interaction, then an
        idea popped into your head "Mentioning bikinis what about the beach?"
        "Oooo, it has been a really long time since we've went. Want to go this
        weekend?" "You sure you'll be off?" "I should be and let's hope God is
        on our side and I don’t get a call out to work." "Sounds like a date."
        "Does that mean, I get to see you wear a bikini, and if yes, can I pick
        out which one?" "Depends, because I swear Ryan if you pick out that full
        body suit one I will strangle you." he raised his hands up "Why would I
        do that? You know I love showing you off." you raised a brow "So you
        want other guys to look at me?" he paused for a moment caught up on the
        thought "And I bet they won't be looking respectfully the way you do."
        that made his face turn up "Maybe that full body one isn't sounding so
        bad." you sat up facing Ryan "Ryan what did I tell you, I'm not wearing
        that. I'm going to wear the sexiest bikini I own." "The red one?" you
        nodded "Yes, the red one" Ryan sighed "I thought you wanted to show me
        off?" "I did, but you made me aware." you got up from your lounge chair
        and joined Ryan in his straddling his hips "Look at it this way, you can
        touch me all you want and if you catch any lingering eyes you can show
        them who I belong to." you instantly saw the gears in Ryan's head
        turning and a smirk appeared on his face "Can I squeeze your butt?" he
        asked while squeezing your left butt cheek "Yes you may, but don't abuse
        it. It's only if you catch a guy looking longer than he should be." Ryan
        hummed to himself "I am loving this. We need to get you more sexy
        bikinis." "Wow Ryan, you changed your mind pretty quick." "Well, minus
        the gorgeous woman on top of me, I get to show you off in public while
        claiming you as mine, and honestly that's kind of hot." he said with a
        smirk looking up at you "Don't get carried away now, we still have to
        keep it family friendly." "Don't worry about that. I'll behave myself."
        "Since when did you know how to do that when it came to me, like look at
        you now. You can't seem to stop touching me." you gestured to his hands
        running from your hips to butt and back "This is me attempting to turn
        you on, so we can have some fun on the balcony." you smacked his chest
        "Ryan we can't have sex out here." you almost whispered and he shrugged
        "Why not?" "First you're an officer, and secondly, indecent exposure is
        a crime." "But we aren't out in public, we're in the comforts of our own
        home." "But what if someone sees us, I don’t want to end up on some
        viral video, and you being an officer your face would spread and you
        could lose your job." Ryan sighed "I didn't think that far. We are close
        to other buildings, but I've always wanted to have sex with you on the
        balcony." you started rubbing Ryan's chest "How about sometime we get
        away, book a hotel room with a balcony and an ocean view, no opposing
        eyes in the area, so we won't get caught and have all the balcony sex we
        want." you raised a brow and Ryan instantly got excited "Baby you're a
        genius. Is it possible that could sometimes book a room for a night,
        because our schedules are always so busy, and mine more than anything
        for us to book some real time away." "We could do that, book it the
        night before we know our next off day will be, have the night, day and
        that hotel room to ourselves." your hands now intertwined at the back of
        his neck. "Gosh you're perfect, you know that." Ryan looked up at you
        with so much love in his eyes before you had time to reply, Ryan
        connected his lips with yours, but you stopped him "We're still
        outside." "Right." he quickly stood, picking you up with him making you
        giggle and wrapped your legs around his hips "Shall we take this
        indoors?" "Yes sir." that was all he needed before heading inside and
        once again connecting his lips back to yours.
