            You were in the kitchen putting away dishes when Ryan came home "Honey, I'm home." "Kitchen" you shouted back, it was a minute before you saw him enter and he was carrying a box in his hand, upon inspection you found out what it was "Is that a shredder?" you asked halting your actions and approached him. He gave you a quick peck after setting down the box on the counter "Yes it is. I just bought it." he said reaching for his pocket knife to unbox it "But why?" "Did you know that identity theft can be a serious thing? Like really serious." "I guess it never really crossed my mind, I mean I know it exist but it just never occurred that it was something that could happen to me." "Well it can, so that's what this is for." you hummed "I see, usually I would just black out my important info with a marker, then rip up the paper before throwing it away." and he paused looking at you "Really? That's pretty impressive." and you nodded "Yeah it was, but don't say I told you this, what I'm about to tell you. This remains between us." he nodded going back to unboxing "We're creating a program software where you should be able to read blacked out lines in any document." he immediately looked at you with an amazing expression "No way. That would be super useful, especially in the department when getting evidence." and you nodded "But it could also be super dangerous in the wrong hands." your lips formed a thin line "You are right about that as well. Are you on this project?" and you nodded "Yes sir, it’s challenging but I know we'll figure it out eventually." "I know you got this." he placed a kiss on your forehead before turning back to the box. He had it opened and was now taking it out "So I'm guessing we're going to be shredding our documents from now on." he nodded "Along with your idea, blacking them out first then shredding. I think that would make a thief not even bother with our trash." "Smart, I like it." "We could set this up in the living room right?" you nodded "That should be good, and when you said we you meant me right?" and he chuckled "Thank you beautiful." and you shook your head heading to the living room and Ryan followed with the shredder in hand.

            After it was set up by you and Ryan watching, you guys decided to test it out "You know how to works this right?" Ryan asked "Yeah, we use these at work." "Life saver you are" and you laughed "It's not that hard, I'll show you." so you showed him how to operate it and he caught on quick enough. For now the official test, you guys got a random paper with lines and blacked it out with a marker before throwing it in the shredder, and when it came out you guys checked the shreds "These are pretty unreadable." and you agreed "No one can decipher these." you both looked at each other proud with smiles and high fived "So what made you think about identity theft?" "While at the crime scene this morning a lady approached me and said her purse was missing and when I helped recovered it, there's a procedure we must do to make sure the items defiantly belongs to them and her name was flagged for identity theft, but she produced the correct documents and gave a great explanation making her clear, so I released the items to her." you guys we sitting on the sofa now "Let me guess, she wasn't the real person." "No she wasn't because, back at the station another approached and said she was her, and she also produced the correct documentation and I honestly had no idea what to do so I had to get professional help." and you chuckled "I thought you were the professional help." "Sort of, still kind of new to this, so I got senior help from Calleigh." "You sound like the child that was approached by an adult asking you a question you couldn't answer so you said let me get my mommy." and you both laugh "If put that way, that is exactly the situation." "So what happened?" "We checked the medical history before the theft to prove who the real one was, which was indeed the second lady." "And did the first lady get arrested, cause that's pretty illegal." and Ryan sighed "Sadly no." "What!? That's not fair." "I thought the exact same thing, but Calleigh said there was nothing else we could of done, because although we give the lady back her identity, the fake could just go and take someone else's." "That's what I was thinking, that's so messed up though, and there wasn't anything real one could of done?" "It's funny you said that because she decided to take the situation in her own hands and killed her ex-husband and tried to framed it on the fake so she would be put behind bars." you were astonished "Wow, but instead she ended up behind bars after getting her identity back. That was such a twist, I did not see that coming." "The whole situation left me completely annoyed." and you nodded "I don’t blame you, I could see why. The fact that there wasn't anything more you could of done, she took matters in her own hands. That really sucks, but murder isn't the answer." and Ryan looked at you and saw the expression you carried, it was the same one he had at the end of the shift "Hey, don’t dwell on it, she did what she did, just going forward let's not be her." "Hence the shredding machine?" you said with a smile and Ryan chuckled "Yes, hence the shredding machine." and you both laugh, knowing from now on going forward to discard important information very carefully.
