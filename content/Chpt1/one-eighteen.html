            Ryan came home all down and sullen. You were on the sofa when he came in, so he quietly greeted you and gave a kiss to your forehead before heading straight to the bedroom. You sat there dazed for a moment before getting up and going after him to see what's the problem. Entering you saw that he was faced down on the bed and before you could of said anything he cut you to it "I really don't want to talk about it. Let's just say I made a mess of things today." you approached him on the bed and sat beside his laying form bringing your hand to rub his back "It's okay babe, you don't have talk, just know everyone has bad days and they don't last forever. Just don't let them keep you down or cause you to give up." you turned his eyes towards your direction but eyes still closed, so you leaned down and peppered kisses along the side of his face that was exposed. "Need me to do anything?" you asked sitting back up "Just want your presence near me." "You got it." you lay down beside him matching his position turning your head to face him, he stared at you for a moment before smiling and closing his eyes, your hand went back to rubbing his back, and you felt him sighed and relaxed. "Thank you." he mumbled "Always." you placed a quick peck to his nose and pulled yourself closer to him and he melted into your embrace.

            After laying there for a good while Ryan got up to shower and asked you to join him, which you did, and while showering he explained his mishaps of the day. After, you told him your thoughts "Today wasn't your day, just don’t let it determine your whole week, and you learnt and know better going forward." you smiled up at him and saw he was still dwelling, reaching up you smooth out his frowned brows saying "Stop thinking about it, the day is over and she forgave you, don’t latch on, let go and grow." he sighed, "You're right, you're always right." he chuckled "I try my best." he leaned down and pressed a kiss to your lips "Want to help me forget for a while." he smirked and you rolled your eyes with a shrugged "Why not." you laughed before planting your lips back on his in a heated kiss.
