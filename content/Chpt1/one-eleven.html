            "Heather!" you heard Ryan's loud voice as he came through the door, so getting up from in front your laptop you made way to him to see why he was being so loud for. Seeing him you raised brow "Why being so loud babe?" after he took off his shoes he approached you and took hold of your face "You would not believe the day I had." after saying that he pulled you in for a random kiss "Hi." he said pulling away and you laughed "Ryan, what is going on, you're being so random." "Well I felt like I cheated death today." "What?! What happened?" he brought his hands away from your face and intertwined them with yours "Well, H and I had to go check out a location and while inside investigating H heard something and when he checked it was a bomb that was about to go off." "You guys got out okay?" you asked worried "Just barely, if he didn’t see it the time he did, we probably wouldn’t have been so lucky." you immediately enveloped him in a hug "That's scary to think about, but at least you guys are okay." you pulled away to look him in the face then pulled him back into the embrace "It is a scary job." "I know it is but most times I try not to think about it, because I'll be in a state of worry twenty four seven." he captured your face in his hands once more "That's why I try to be extra careful and bring home myself to you in one piece." "Thank you." you leaned up and connected your lips with his "But besides that you had a good day?" he nodded "Yes mam, I did." you sighed and rested your forehead on his chest while he took you in his arms.

            "Also I forgot mention, I worked with a facial recognition software today, that was pretty amazing." you guys were currently on the sofa, your head in Ryan's lap "I know the software, that's one of ours. I had to do some code for that, part of my start up for the company, just to see what I was capable of." "No way, really?!" and you laughed at his expression, you looked up at him before replying "Yes sir, your girlfriend is pretty smart you know." "So you actually help built that software?" he felt you nod  "Have you done any other things for the department?" "Not as yet but going forward, I would be assigned to build stuff for MDPD, well part of the team, but I'm working towards to getting the leader role for that team." Ryan was so amazed and finding out this new information "Why didn't you tell me about this?" you sat up and Ryan followed your movements "I wanted it to be a surprise, one day you'll be at work and see me there. Whether it be a seminar where I'm showing you guys new software or programs or me coming in to work on something." Ryan couldn’t stop smiling "That's so cool. Do you know how proud I am of you, can I show you off?" and you laughed "To who exactly?" "My work colleagues?" you thought for a moment "Maybe sometime in the future and if everything works out well and I get the position." "I can't wait. You're going to get that position." "Ryan, you can't be so sure, and don’t jinx it." and he raised his hands in surrender "I'm sorry, my girlfriend is just so amazing, I have to hype her up." and you laughed hitting his hand "Calm down. I don’t want my nerves getting the best of me." "Okay I'll stop, for now." he placed a quick kiss to your temple and you rolled your eyes, laying back down in his lap "What if I just randomly tell them that my girlfriend is super cool?" "No Ryan, cause then they'll ask questions." "Fine, I'll just say you're boring instead" you bit his thigh at that "I'm kidding. You're anything but boring, if anything you're kinky with biting me." he chuckled and you hid your face "Leave me be Ryan." "Not after that, I possibly couldn't, maybe I should say you're kinky instead." and he burst out laughing as you tried to hide your face further "I hate you." he leaned over to whisper in your ear "You know you don't." and he kissed your temple once again "Let me watch tv in peace." you said uncovering your face and looked at the tv ignoring Ryan and all he did was laugh "I love you too baby." a smile made its way to your lips.
