            Ryan came home to find you working away on your laptop in the kitchen. You were sat by the island when you saw him enter. "Hey hun." he greeted you then placed a kiss to your temple "Hey." you gave him a quick look and smile before turning back to your laptop "I can see that work never stops." he made his way to the fridge getting a bottle of water "Sadly. Thought I was done for the day, but got an email of some code they want me to look over." "Soon finished?" he asked standing the opposite of the island and you nodded "Just about. You know I'm a pro at my job." that caused Ryan to chuckle before drinking more water. There was some silence while you finished what you were doing and then you closed your laptop with a satisfied sigh. Looking up you saw Ryan for the first time properly since he came in and found that he already discarded his jacket placing it the back of one of the chairs. "Hi babe." you said laughing and getting up to go and give him a proper greeting. "Hello." a huge grin gracing his face and he took you in his arms the moment you got in front of him, tiptoeing you connected lips into a sweet kiss "Had a good day?" you asked pulling away and he nodded "Went pretty smoothly, but it did cause me to be curious about something." "What is it?" you asked stepping out his embrace and going to the fridge "Have you ever been badly bullied in high school?" "No I haven't, just laughed at or made fun of, but never badly bullied, and for us we would refer to high school as secondary school." you took out the pots of left overs to heat up "What about you?" "I did, but that's a story for another time." you chuckled "Okay, when you're ready. What made you ask, today's case contained a massive bully?" "Sort of, there was a high school reunion and one of the members got killed. Apparently a kid he severally bullied back then, it affected his whole life, left him completely scarred, literally, so he decided to take vengeance and kill the guy fifteen years later." "Damn, that is harsh. But you know what it is to kill your bully fifteen years later. I lowkey feel for him, but involving in murder, that's basically saying that the guy allowed the bully to take hold of his life because look where he ended up, in jail." Ryan was listening to you intently "It wasn't worth it." "I like your opinion on these cases, it allows me to see your thought process." "And is it good?" "I love it, you always speak very wise." that made you laugh "Alright Gandalf." and Ryan joined "By the way, yellow looks nice on you, I don’t see you wear it often." "Why thank you, I guess you can say that I got kissed by the sun this morning." your face immediately heated up cause you knew he was referring to you "You are so cheesy babe." "Only for you." and all you did was shake your head and laugh "Go and shower, while I heat up dinner." he saluted "Yes mam." when he passed he pressed a quick kiss to your temple before disappearing to the bedroom.

            "So you would say you had great high school days, well sorry, secondary school days?" Ryan asked as you both were sitting at the dining table just finished eating "Yeah, you could say that. Definitely having the friends I did, made school very bearable." "So that means you would return?" "Oh gosh no, hated those days." you said with a laugh "Did your school also have categories, that the students would separate into, like here in the U.S.?" "Yeah we sort of had them, but not to the extreme that you guys have here." "And what category were you in?" Ryan asked with a raised brow intrigued "I guess you could say the quiet nerd category." Ryan was amazed "Really?! I would never have guessed that, knowing how gorgeous and confident you are, I would of guessed that you would be in the popular group." you laughed and shook your head "I was nowhere near like that in school. I was super quiet, shy, always did my work, on the honor's roll. There even came a time there was a teachers meeting and the principle didn’t even knew I was a student there." Ryan quickly tried to hide his laugh "I'm sorry, but not the principle." and you nodded "It's true, because I was that quiet and I never got into trouble." "Well from your description you sounded like a star student." "Hearing you say that I guess, you're right, I was a star student." you giggled to yourself feeling proud "And that time back then, did you picture that this is where you would be now?" "Back then, I figured by this time, I would be working as a forensic scientist, probably married and maybe children, just living a simple life." "You wanted to be a forensic scientist?" Ryan ears perked up at that "Yeah, back then that was my dream job, but that department was removed from our police stations because we don't have extreme creative murders like here, plus Barbados is very very small, you can't hide or kill someone and get away with it." "That's very interesting, I guess you learn something new every day about the love of your life, so that dream you had compared to the life you're actually living now, how is it." "Honestly, this reality is so much better, because I never expected to be living in Miami, being in love with a CSI officer, and having my dream job. I wouldn't trade this for anything." you gave Ryan a sweet smile and that made him smile as well, hearing what you said "Well, I am very glad that your dreams changed so I could of met you, because right now I can't imagine my life if you weren't in it." "The same here, that's all God's doing." Ryan reached forward and captured your lips with his, "I love you Heather." you paused to reply "And I love you Ryan." he gave a satisfied smile before continuing the kiss.
