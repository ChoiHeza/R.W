        Ryan was first to wake this morning, because it was your day off and he
        had a special errand to run before work. Getting up quietly not to wake
        you, he gave you a kiss to the forehead before heading to the bathroom
        to shower. While Ryan was in the shower you woke and saw he wasn't
        beside you, so checking the time you saw it was pretty early and thought
        to yourself that maybe Ryan got called to come in earlier than usual, so
        you got up and headed to the bathroom to wash up. "Good morning, got to
        go in early?" "Good morning babe, yeah I have to" Ryan lied only because
        he doesn't want you to know what he's up to "Okay, want breakfast?" you
        asked after washing your face and out your mouth "I'll just have
        coffee." "Okay, I'll get the pot on." "Thanks baby." you left the
        bathroom and headed to the kitchen to get the coffee ready for when
        Ryan's ready to go. Twelve minutes later Ryan entered the kitchen all
        dressed ready to leave, and his coffee was finished and in his mug,
        "Your coffee is ready to go and I made you your favourite, a roast beef
        sandwich for lunch, just reheat it as usual." "You're perfect, thank you
        beautiful." he approached and gave you a full on kiss which you returned
        "You are welcome, have a good day today okay?" "I will." "and be safe."
        "Always." Ryan gave you another kiss before putting the sandwich in his
        bag and taking his coffee mug from your hands. With another kiss, Ryan
        was out the door.

        Ryan was currently inspecting several ring designs that an assistant had
        displayed on top the counter "Is she the fancy type or simple?" the lady
        asked Ryan "She is pretty simple, but I want to get her something that
        will suit her perfectly." Ryan told the lady giving her a quick look,
        and the woman thought for a moment "Do you have a photo of her?" "Yeah"
        Ryan fished out his phone and quickly looked for a photo of you, it was
        one of his personal favourites' because you looked really gorgeous, and
        you weren't aware that he was taking a picture of you "This is her."
        Ryan said handing the phone to the lady and she inspected the photo, a
        smile appearing on her face "She is gorgeous, I think I might just have
        the perfect ring, and it's none of these." she gestured to the rings she
        had out, so handing the phone back to Ryan she put away the rings and
        told Ryan to follow her. She lead him to a showcase and took out the
        ring and the moment Ryan saw it, he knew it was the one "That is the
        one, it will look perfect on her." "So you will take it?" Ryan nodded
        "Yes, also, can I have a look at wedding bands as well, because I want
        to marry her as soon as possible." Ryan said with a huge smile, not
        believing he's actually doing this and the lady's expression matched his
        "Of course sir, let me show you what we have." after looking Ryan made
        his selections and made his purchase. With the rings securely in his
        pockets, he left the store with the biggest smile on his face and headed
        off to work.

        He arrived at the scene and on the outside of the tape was his ex,
        Erika. "I'm not surprised to find you here." he said alerting her and
        she turned "Hey Ryan, you know, just doing my job." "I can see that."
        "How have you been?" she asked him as Ryan went under the tape "Doing
        great actually, what about you?" "I guess I can say so myself. Would
        like to get dinner some time and catch up for old times sake." Ryan gave
        her a smile "Nah, I'm good." "Alright, but you know where to find me if
        you change your mind." "I won't" Ryan said walking away not waiting for
        her reply. In the distance Ryan saw Delko and you immediately popped
        into his mind about what you told him, but he wasn't going to do it just
        yet, he'll wait till they're back at the lab. Arriving back at the lab
        Ryan saw Erika outside "Twice in one day, if I didn’t know any better
        I'll say you're stalking me." "You wish, I'm here to find out if there
        is anything you could tell me about the investigation." "You know I
        can't do that." they continued talking and Ryan may have said something
        that caused there to be a leak in the investigation and that lead to a
        huge breaking news on the tv.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="story">
        You were currently watching tv when you saw the news, and panic settled
        in so you immediately reached for the phone and called Ryan "Hey babe,
        something wrong?" "Well I was hoping you would tell me, are we supposed
        to evacuate because of some radiation bomb that can go off?" you asked
        pacing now "What are you talking about and where did you get that
        information?" "The news, it's on the news right now." Ryan was super
        confused "Just calm down, and stay put, I'll check out what's going on,
        but you're in no danger okay." "Okay, but do call back to let me know
        everything is okay." "I will." he hung up and went to follow through
        with the info he received from you. Upon arriving to the others he saw
        the news you were talking about and there she was, Erika spreading
        something that she shouldn’t have. Delko gave Ryan a talk about that,
        blaming him for being the leak, which he was if he didn't intended it to
        be. That just added more fuel to the fire, and Ryan understood what you
        meant by the longer this goes on, the worse it's going to get between
        them, so sighing he followed after Delko to finally apologize "Hey Eric,
        wait up." Delko paused and turned to look to Ryan giving him a look
        "Coming to ask for more information to leak?" he said before starting to
        walk away but Ryan halted him "No, I came to apologize. Not only for the
        accidental leak, which you know I would never do on purpose to
        jeopardize the case or the department, and also for how things have been
        between us. We're supposed to be a team and not at each other throats
        all the time, but someone put me in my place and told me to put my pride
        aside and apologize, so that's what I'm doing. I'm saying sorry for how
        I've treated you and for what I've done to start this and I should of
        waited for you that day." Delko just listened as Ryan talked but deep
        down Delko wasn't done being mad at Ryan but he was tired and understood
        where Ryan was coming from "Look man it's okay, I'm sorry too for how
        I've treated you,. I shouldn't have been hard on you as I was, it wasn't
        fair." Ryan nodded, accepting the apology. There was a pause before
        Delko talked again "That must be one hell of a person to put you in your
        place, because I know you don't stand down." Ryan smiled at that "Yeah,
        it was my girlfriend actually, she called me out for being a jerk and
        said I was wrong in the beginning. She told me to apologize a while now
        but pride over took me." and a smiled appeared on Delko's face as well
        "I get that, the pride thing, but I've never heard you talk of a
        girlfriend before." "You never asked" Ryan said with a raised brow "Fair
        point, but you guys must be going steady for you to listen to her like
        that, because no casual girlfriend could do that." "We've been dating
        for almost 3 years. I'm actually thinking of asking her to marry me."
        Delko eyes opened at that "Really?" and Ryan nodded reaching into his
        pocket for your ring box to show him, Delko inspected and whistled
        "That's gorgeous, you're serious about this." "Yeah, very serious, I
        bought it this morning, just don't know when to ask her." Ryan and Delko
        continued talking before going their separate ways to continue the
        investigation.

      <p class="story">
        After having a very very long day, and hearing about what happened with
        Detective Hagen, Ryan realized just how short life can be and anything
        can happen at any time. It all made him thought of you, he knows you're
        not going to kill yourself but he knows that you can be taken from him
        at any moment so he doesn't want to waste any more time not letting you
        know how he felt. Entering the apartment, he quickly took off his shoes
        and bag and went to look for you "Heather?" he called and you answered
        out from the bedroom "Bedroom!" he followed your voice and entered the
        room and saw that you were currently putting away laundry "Hey, you're
        home." you paused your folding and met Ryan halfway, he immediately,
        captured his face in yours and planted a deep loving kiss on your lips,
        "Hey, are you okay?" "He rested his forehead against yours before
        speaking "You know that I love you so much right, and that I don’t know
        where my life would be without you, and that I never want to lose you
        right." "I know Ryan, I'm not going anywhere." you reassured him when he
        took his forehead from yours, looking you intently into your eyes "Also
        you know what I want to spend the rest of my life with you, so…" there
        was a pause to what Ryan was saying and he reached into his pocket
        pulling out the box that contained the ring "Heather, my gorgeous
        girlfriend, would you do the honors of making me the happiest, joyous
        man in the world and marry me?" he opened the box and you looked at the
        contents and it all finally registered so you brought your hands up to
        your mouth totally surprised and caught off guard "You're being
        serious?" and he nodded with a big smile on his face "Very serious babe,
        will you?" you immediately nodded and jumped into Ryan's arms completely
        ecstatic. He hugged you closely against him "Wait, let me put it on."
        Ryan said making you pull away and he took it from the box and slipped
        it onto your finger, smiles never leaving any of your faces. When the
        ring was on, immediately you went back into his arms. After a moment you
        both pulled away, and Ryan looked at the ring on your finger and said
        "This was definitely the one, it's perfect." then looked up at you at
        the end of his sentence "It is gorgeous, thank you." "Only the best for
        my beautiful fiancé." you both loved the sound of that "So when do you
        want to get married, this weekend?" you said jokingly "Okay, nothing
        fancy, you wear white, I get a suit and we go down to the court house
        and grab uncle Ron as our witness." Ryan quickly replied not joking
        making your eyes go wide "Wait, really?! I was just joking." "I wasn't,
        unless that's too soon?" and you shook your head "No, it's perfect." "So
        we're getting married this weekend?" Ryan asked hopeful "Yes!" you
        quickly replied with a rapid nod so Ryan captured your lips once more
        not believing how blessed he is to have you. "Want to go out and
        celebrate and let me introduce you to random people as my fiancé?" you
        laughed and nodded "Let's do that." you both were completely happy and
        filled with joy.
