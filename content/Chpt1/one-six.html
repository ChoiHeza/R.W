        Ryan was the first home, you had to work a bit late today, getting you
        home a little after six in the evening. "Finally I am home." you sighed
        coming in through the door, "Ryan!" you called out when you didn’t hear
        him, and still got no response, so taking off your shoes and resting
        down your bags to went in search for Ryan. "Where are you boyfriend?"
        you said making your way through the apartment, kitchen empty, living
        room empty, so you went to the bedroom next and still nothing. So you
        assumed he must be in the bathroom, you knocked before entering. There
        he was in the shower, with his back turned to you, so you decided to
        surprise him. You took off your clothes leaving them in a pile on the
        floor, and slowly stepped into the shower. Wrapping your arms around
        from behind you felt him jumped and that made you release a giggle
        "Heather, you startled me." he chuckled and you kissed his back
        apologizing "I'm sorry, but I saw the perfect opportunity and took it."
        you pulled away and started wetting your body. "Just this minute came
        in?" Ryan asked continuing to shower "Yes sir." "Busy day?" "You have no
        idea, got a bit of a headache, so I'm ready to eat and then sleep."
        "Okay, so I'll heat up dinner then." Ryan said finishing up with his
        shower and gave you a quick kiss before getting out, wrapping a towel
        around him "Thank you, you're a doll." Ryan chuckled at your statement.
        He left and you finished your shower.

        "Miami have pirates? Like real pirates? Do they wear eye patches?" you
        were so intrigued firing away questions and Ryan laughed "They're more
        modern, so sadly no eye patches." and you sighed at that feeling bummed
        "But they were actually pretty wicked. Finding six men underwater strung
        together, being all drowned, that is a harsh way to go." you both were
        currently in bed after finished eating, just laying side by side, with
        the tv on in the background long forgotten after asking Ryan about his
        day. "So were they any that got away?" "Three did actually, but one of
        them ended up dead. He was killed by one of the other guys, and you
        would not believe what they did." you thought for a moment trying to
        take a guess but gave up "What?" "They ate the guy's foot." and
        instantly your face went up in disgust tongue going out your mouth. That
        made you get up, heading to the bathroom. "I don't know if I'll be able
        to do that." "Really, you would starve first?" Ryan asked following in
        after you "You would?!" you whipped your head around at him quickly
        while reaching for your toothbrush "I don’t know." he said with a shrug
        coming beside you to brush his teeth as well "Remind me to not get
        stranded with you somewhere." you gave him a side eye before looking
        back to the mirror, continuing your brushing "If someone had to eat you,
        wouldn't you prefer that it be me?" he said looking at you through the
        mirror, you thought for a moment before replying "Maybe… but to be
        eaten. Then again if I did had to pick someone to eat me, sadly it would
        have to be you." and he chuckled at that.

        "The more you know of someone." you said shaking your head recalling the
        convo you and Ryan had in the bathroom. You were both back in bed for
        the rest of the night. "What" Ryan asked turning to you, he was busy
        watching tv. "That you would eat someone." and Ryan laughed "You're
        still on that?" and you nodded "Honestly speaking, I don’t think I
        actually would, cause that's honestly pretty disgusting." "Now he says
        that." and he laughed "I'm being serious." he tried to tell you but you
        still didn’t buy it "It's okay Ryan, if you want to eat human flesh," he
        released a huge sigh, "Goodnight Heather, I'll see you in the morning."
        he said pulling the blanket over him and turning away from you and you
        laughed "Babe, come on. You know I'm just messing with you." you reached
        over to him and still no response, so you placed a kissed on his cheek
        "Goodnight Ryan." laying down yourself but hugging his back making him
        the little spoon then you placed another kiss on the back of his neck
        before nuzzling your head. You felt him sigh before turning in your arms
        to lay on his back placing you on his chest. "I love you." you heard him
        say, "And I love you."
