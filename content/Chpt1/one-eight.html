            "Hello handsome." you said cheerfully as you approached Ryan. He held the passenger door open for you leaning against it. "Hey you." he replied with a smile as you placed a quick kiss to his cheek before getting in and Ryan closed the door behind you. It was Friday so usually Ryan would pick you up from work and you guys would go out for ice cream after. He jogged over to the driver side and got in. After being secured you both were off to your destination. "Had a good day today?" Ryan asked placing his hand on your thigh "Surprisingly peaceful for a Friday. What about you?" he shrugged "The usual." you sensed something was bothering him from his response "I don't buy it, but you can talk when you're ready." you gave his hand on your thigh a squeeze and he chuckled offering you a small smile "Thanks babe." "Always." you gave him one look before turning your head to gaze out the window. It was a peaceful drive with the radio softly playing in the background and before you knew it you guys arrived at the parlor. Ryan parked and you both got out walking hand in hand towards the shop. Reaching it Ryan opened the door gesturing for you to enter first "Ladies first." "Why thank you babe." you offered a smile entering and he followed behind you. Going to your usual booth, you guys waited for server to take your order. You picked up the menu while saying "I feel like trying something new." you suggested looking over the menu "Anything particular in mind?" "Maybe the chunky, chocolate chip, oreo flavour. I've had my eyes on it for a while, but it always sounded really sweet, but I'm feeling daring." you said giving him a raised brow and he laughed at you "Maybe I should try something new too." he picked up a menu of his own and gave a look. A minute later a waitress arrived at your table. "Good evening and welcome to The Miami Chill, what would you guys be having?" she said cheerfully and the moment her eyes landed on Ryan they barely left "We would like the chunky chocolate chip oreo and the vanilla caramel toffee." Ryan said finally looking up from the menu to the waitress and he gave a friendly smile while she returned a flirty one "You got it, I'll make sure to get your order done perfectly." she said with a wink before going over to the counter. When she was out of ear shot you scoffed "Wow, the audacity of her." "What is it?" and you gave him a look "Did you not notice that she was flirting with you?" and he looked completely confused "I had no idea." and all you did was shook your head "Just pay attention when she returns." and he nodded.

            While in the middle of conversation the waitress returned and cut you off "Here is your order handsome." she said super flirty while placing down the ice creams on the table "One chunky chocolate chip oreo and one vanilla caramel toffee. If you need anything you know where to find me." she gave Ryan a wink and you a dirty look "Thanks" Ryan said with his lips pressed into a thin line and she walked away giving his shoulder a touch. Then I looked at him when she was far enough "You saw!" you said with a lot of hand gestures "I did. As you would say, the audacity of this bitch." that made you laugh out and you quickly covered your mouth forgetting for a moment that you're in public and Ryan laughed at you but quietly. Forgetting the waitress you both dived into your ice creams "How is it?" Ryan asked while eating his "Surprisingly really good and not as sweet as I suspected. Taste it." you took a spoonful of yours and fed it too Ryan and you saw his eyes went wide "That is good. Really good." and he fed you his "It's not bad, but it feels like it's missing something." "I was thinking the same thing. Want to switch?" and you instantly shook your head no and Ryan chuckled "How about instead of switching let’s eat half of each?" you suggested with a raised brow and Ryan liked the sound of that. "Deal."

            Ice cream switched and finishing the last half Ryan opened up "While processing evidence today, I missed something." he was looking down in his cup. It took you a while before you caught on to what he was talking about "Did you get in trouble?" "No, Horatio found it, but I felt really bad. How could I miss something like that." you took hold of his hand "Ryan, mistakes happen, and I know you're going to say, as a CSI that shouldn't have happened, so what I'm going to tell you is that to don’t let it happen again." what you said brought a smile to Ryan's face "You got it beautiful, thank you." he brought your hand up and left a lingering kiss to the back of it "You're cold, I'm going to give you my jacket." he started to take it off "You don't ha-" Ryan shushed you taking his jacket off completely, stood and leaned over the table placing it on your shoulders. You placed your arms through the armholes inhaling the sent it gave, and it smelt everything like Ryan. "Thanks. It smells just like you. I love it." you said bringing up to take whiff before going back to your ice cream. That made Ryan laugh and shake his head at you. You both enjoyed the rest of your ice cream while joking and laughing away with each other. "All done." you nodded "Yes sir." "Okay let's go." you both got up leaving your glasses and heading to the front to pay for the ice cream, with your arm hooked through Ryan's you guys reached the cashier. And of course, that waitress was there so she gave Ryan yet another flirty smile clearly ignoring your presence while asking "Enjoyed your ice cream handsome?" and you rolled your eyes at that and Ryan probably sensed it caused he looked down at you quickly with a chuckle before turning back to her and replying "My wife and I enjoyed our ice cream. I would like to pay please." a scowl appeared on her face and you quickly bit your lip to stop the laughter that was threatening to come out. She snatched the money from Ryan's hand and he couldn't stop himself from smiling, after the transaction, you both left and the moment you got outside, laughter erupted from the both of you "Did you see her face?" and you nodded "Thank you for that, but you didn't had to lie." you stood facing him and he looked down at you "It wasn't a complete lie, cause somewhere in the future we're married." that instantly brought a smile to your face "Us married?" and Ryan nodded "Of course, we're going to get married someday." your smile just kept getting bigger and you leaned up pressing a kiss to his lips "Well I can't wait to be Mrs. Wolfe." that made Ryan returned a wide smile of his own, he like the sound of that, you becoming Mrs. Wolfe. "Well let's get home future Mrs. Wolfe." you giggled at that and headed for the car.

            You both got home, showered and was currently in the living room on the sofa watching tv "Today's case was pretty interesting." you turned your head to show you were listening and he continued "The victim, female, she was killed on her wedding anniversary, she and husband just came from having lunch when their car was hijacked, apparently, it was one of the husband brothers that killed her." "Why?" "She had a gambling addiction, and clearly wasn't very good at it, cause she kept needing money, so besides getting money from one of the husbands other brother, she sold her eggs." and you paused Ryan "You can sell your eggs?!" your eyes lit up at that "Apparently you can." your mind went into thinking mode and Ryan cut you out "No Heather, don’t even think about it." and you shrugged "Was just a thought, I wouldn't do that though. So she got killed for gambling?" Ryan shook his head "No, she got killed for selling her eggs." confusion appeared on your face "But why though?" "Because he said she was just selling off the blood of the family, and they rightfully belonged to them." you held up your hands "Hold up, last time I checked, she was the wife to husband, so she's not related to them by blood and it being her eggs, there's no connection to them being the blood of the family." you statement made Ryan paused and think "You are right you know, I didn’t think about that, and clearly neither did him." "That sucks though, that she was killed for something like that." you sighed and Ryan nodded "The husband doesn't want anything to do with his brother anymore." "I don’t blame him and plus it was their wedding anniversary, that made it even worse. So how much did she sell her eggs for?" "Heather no, I'm not telling you." you pouted "But-" "No buts, babe we're financially stable okay, so no need to sell your eggs." you sighed and leaned back against the sofa turning back to the tv "Fine, I won't push." and Ryan laughed "Good girl." you just rolled your eyes and smiled.
