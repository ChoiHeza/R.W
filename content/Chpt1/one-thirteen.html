            "Why have I never taken you to the Everglades?" Ryan asked turning his head to look at you. You both were currently in bed for the night and just watching tv till whenever sleep overcomes you both. "For perfect reasons Ryan. Take today for example, a dead body was found with his head in a gator's mouth." you gave him a side eye "Fair point, but besides that, wouldn't you be even a little interested in going. You've been living in Miami for almost three and some years now." "And?" "You should at least visit. Might make you an official citizen." he suggested and you thought for a bit then shook your head "I think I'll wait till I'm married to you to become an official citizen." and Ryan laughed "Then when we're married I'm going to take you." "Ryan why…?" "Because my wife will deserve to see all that Miami has to offer." "I think I can watch my tv and see gators just fine from the comforts of my own home." Ryan sat up now "Heather come on, just once, you never know, you might like it." he shrugged his shoulders "I feel like people go out there just to do illegal stuff or die." "Maybe." you pointed your finger at him "There! You made my point." Ryan laughed "Okay, I see your point." then he really got to thinking "Maybe going there might not be the best option." and you agreed "Now you're speaking my language. Why did that guy go there?" "Him and a friend of his went to purchase some illegal alcohol." "The more you speak, the more you are proving my point babe, and how did the guy end up dead?" "His friend killed him because his girlfriend was cheating on him with him and the whole campus knew but him." "Okay so that includes all three." "All three what?" "The main reasons mentioned not to go to the Everglades." Ryan gave a puzzled look and you clarified "They were going to do something illegal, then one of them got killed and said killed person ended up in a gator." "Ahh, okay okay. I see what you mean. I basically proved your point." Ryan chuckled "And you wanted to take me there, tsk, if I didn’t know any better I would say you wanted to put me in harm's way." he immediately shook his head "Never. I want you safe at all times." "Then keep me from the glades?" "Yes mam." you laughed, rejoicing internally, convincing him to change his mind was pretty easy.
