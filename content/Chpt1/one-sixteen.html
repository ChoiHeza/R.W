            It was a cool late evening out that made you and Ryan to talk a stroll along the board walk just getting some fresh air. Intertwined fingers swung between the two of you as you guys walked side by side enjoying sounds surrounding you. Ryan was the first to break the silence "Hey, I need your opinion on something." "Shoot, but not literally." you giggled at your own joke and Ryan chuckled before continuing "Today Delko and I were working a crime scene together and he found main evidence, so I took it and told him to I'm going to head off and give it to H, and he said but he's the one that found it and I should wait for him, but I told him H needed it right away, and I just left him there." "and what about this situation that you need my opinion on?" "Was I in the wrong and should I apologize to him?" you thought for a moment before replying "Yes and yes. That was kind of a jerk thing to do Ryan." and he sighed "Maybe I was a gentlemen?" Ryan said hopefully and you shook your head "No babe, you were a lowkey jerk, and I think you should apologize, be the bigger guy, and I bet it's not fun having awkwardness in the workplace." Ryan remained silent for a moment taking in everything you said and sighed "Times like this I wish you weren't right." "That's just the pride talking." you reached up and flicked his temple "So you will apologize?" "Do I have a choice?" "You always have a choice baby, I'm not deciding this one for you. You asked for my opinion and I gave it. It's up to you to do what you want to do with it." you gave him a side smile looking at him "Thanks babe." "You'll think about it?" he nodded "I will." he offered a smile and then kissed your temple. "Besides this little feud between you guys, what do you think of him?" Ryan thought for a moment "He's not a bad guy, chill, he has his ways that would make us butt heads but outside of that I tolerate him." "Tolerate, not on the like scale?" "The jury is still out." and you laughed "If you say so, but you're getting along well with everyone else?" Ryan nodded "Yes mam, it's just Eric." "That's good, minus the Eric part, so get that rectified, yeah?" Ryan nodded once again but with a reply, because he was thinking over the situation, maybe you were right, it's his pride.
