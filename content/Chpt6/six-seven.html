            So far the work day has started off pretty hectic for everyone because there was a missing young female, so everyone was doing what they could to help find her and hopefully alive. It was until a search party lead by Ryan took place that lead to finding out that the young girl was already gone and apparently there was others. Because a dismembered arm and leg were found, the arm belonging to the missing girl while the leg was unknown. After investigation took place, the team found out that the leg belonged with to girl from Las Vegas. When Calleigh approached you needing help in contacting the Las Vegas Crime Lab, you released a squeal, catching her off guard "What's with the excitement?" she asked beaming at your reaction "Do you know who leads the Las Vegas CSI Crime Lab?" you asked her trying to contain your excitement and she nodded smiling at you "Yeah, Dr. Langston." you nodded rapidly "It's the Dr. Raymond Langston, I am a huge fan, I've even read his book." Calleigh was surprised to hear this "I didn't take it you were into forensics." she commented and you nodding before replying "When I was younger, I wanted to be a forensic scientist but that department was removed from our police departments so that's how I ended up changing careers. To be a forensic scientist was dream, because I loved watching detective pictures, and I guess it's still a passion of mine." Calleigh was very intrigued at what you were telling and also amazed "I had no idea, but that's pretty amazing." she said with a wide smile "So you are not in total darkness to what we do in the labs?" she asked and you shook your head "Not really, I know some things plus you learn a few extra things when married to a forensic scientist." you stated with a chuckle and she agreed "Well, then I guess you will be joining me in my meeting with Dr. Langston?" Calleigh asked you and your eyes widened "I can?" you asked and she nodded, and you couldn't have been more happy "Thank you, you have no idea how amazing this is." with that you got to work on connecting to the Las Vegas Crime Lab, and before you knew it, you were seeing the man himself and the smile would not leave your face. Calleigh allowed you to introduce yourself and be they got to discussing the matter at hand.

            There came a knock at the entrance of your lab making you turn to the sound "Hey beautiful." Ryan greeted as he answered making you smile "Hey, what brings you by?" you asked before turning back to your screen "I heard my wife had a fangirling session today." Ryan said making you look towards him and saw there was a smile gracing his lips "Calleigh told you?" you asked smiling yourself and he nodded "It was amazing, you should have been there, and the fact that I got to meet him in person, oh be still my beating heart." Ryan just chuckled at your behaviour but he was happy for you "At this point someone would think that you're a forensic scientist." Ryan said and you entered in thought "Why don't you become one." Ryan queried and you both shared a look "I have thought about it but, I love what I do now." you said gesturing to the surface computer in front of you "But, I don't know, it would be like a dream come through, but to go through school again." you said truthfully "But it doesn't sound like a definite no." just as Ryan said that his phone rang "This is Wolfe.". He got called out to the scene to help look for more body parts so he gave a tap to your lower back before leaving.

            With tablet in hand you were on your way back to your lab when Jessie spotted you "Short stuff." he called out making you look his direction and a smile graced your face "Dimples." you both were in front each other now "Heading my way?" you asked and he nodded so you both started walking together "So what do you need?" you asked, quickly looking towards him "Nothing in particular, I was just going to stop by to tell you something while on my way." he said with a hint a laughter so now you were intrigued to know what it was "Based on the tone of your voice, it's got to be something good." you said smiling yourself "You have no idea. When we were out searching for more parts we encountered a bear." your eyes widened at that "You guys okay?" you asked with worry and he nodded "Yeah, but Ryan and Walter almost became bear food." he said with a chuckle "They froze in fear, didn't they?" you asked laugh threatening to escape from you and when you heard Jessie release his laugh that answered your question "And I think Walter was going to sacrifice your husband to the bear." you faked gasped at that "Walter, how dare he, I'm going to have some words with him." you said making you both laughed and you guys joked some more.

            You were the first in the locker room at the end of the shift but you weren't alone for long because Walter and Ryan entered shortly after. "Walter Simmons." you called the moment your eyes landed on him "Whenever you full name me I get scared." Walter said making Ryan chuckle "I know the feeling." Ryan quickly whispered to Walter. "You." you started pointing a finger Walter's direction "Was going to sacrifice my husband to the bear?" you asked him and Ryan burst out laughing "How did you know about that?" Walter asked and you shook your head "That's not important. So, yes or no?" you asked with slit eyes "It's best to be honest cause she clearly already knows the truth." Ryan commented making Walter sigh "Okay, I did but it wasn't intentional or direct." Walter explained and you just gave him a look before smiling "It's okay because I heard you both screamed like girls." now it was both their turn to point fingers at you "In my defense, I was. ." Ryan started but paused trying to find something to say so shook your head with a laugh "It's okay to be scared babe." you said holding back a smile "Did you guys thank CSI Cardoza for saving you both?" you said in a playful voice "So he was the tattletale, I should of known." Walter said hands going to his hips and you shrugged "Can you blame him, it was funny once I found out you guys were okay." "You're not going to let this go aren't you?" Ryan asked looking at you and you went into a position as if you were thinking "I would of, but it's the girlish screams part that I'll hold onto." and just that moment Jessie entered the locker room and greeted everyone "Hey girls." he said with a playful smile making you laugh and the others sigh.

            "I hate cases like these." Ryan said as his arms around you tightened. You both were currently on the sofa watching tv when the news came on showing the events of the day and they mentioned the woman that were killed. "The dismembering part?" you asked and felt him release a sigh "The kidnapping and torturing part." Ryan while reaching for the remote and changing the channel. When you heard him say that, you immediately knew why. "Yeah it really does suck, but you guys found the people responsible." you said hoping to make Ryan feel better "Yeah, and that's a win but you know how my mind thinks." Ryan said like he was in thought so you loosened his hold on you so you could turn to look at him "Speak your thoughts Ryan, and let me help you settle them." you said with a tilt of your head and a soft smile "You. Cases like these always makes me think of you." he said looking deep into your eyes, so you took hold of his face "Nothing is going to happen to me baby, I'll be fine." you said but Ryan shook his head "But something already did. You forgot you were kidnapped and thank goodness you weren't tortured but that day never leaves my mind, because the only person to blame was me." you were quick to stop him "It was not your fault Ryan. I was never the intended target, I just happened to be at the wrong place and the wrong time." you tried to tell him but he wouldnâ€™t listen "Yeah, I get that but all of this would have been avoided if I never gambled, then I wouldn't have been involved with Mark and the Russians wouldn't have a reason to target us." you get what Ryan was saying but you weren't going to allow him to carry this alone "Well, if you're blaming yourself, then I should blame myself as well. When you were still gambling, I should have been able to pick up on it and helped you sooner." you said and Ryan gave you a look "Don't do that." "Do what?" you asked confused "Share my blame, because it's not yours to carry." you took offense to that "Well I'm sorry, that as your wife, I just can't sit here and watch my husband blame something on himself that was beyond his control." you said annoyance dripping from your voice and Ryan realized you were serious about what you said. You shook your head and started to get up but Ryan held onto your hand stopping you "Wait." that made you sit back down and look back at him, he sighed before continuing "I'm sorry, I just.." it was hard for him to find the words to say "It's not easy to forget what happened." he finally said and you understood that "Have you talked to the therapist about it?" you asked and he hesitated before answering "No. No I haven't. I know I should of but she's going to make me relive that moment." holding his hands in yours now "I understand, but you know that's only to help you move past it." he nodded "I know, but that was like one of the worst days of my life." Ryan said eyes going sad and your heart sank at that, and for once you didn't know what to say, so all you could of think to do was hug him. You quickly wrapped him in your embrace pulling him close to you as possible "I'm sorry." you've managed to say and his arms tightened on you "It's not your fault, but you are right. I should talk about it, to get past it." he said before leaning back to look at you so you smiled down at him "And if you ever want me to accompany you there and wait for you, I don't mind." you said making Ryan chuckle "I think I can handle it, but I will keep that in mind." your smile widen "Good boy." you said and Ryan released a small laugh "Thank you." you lightly shook your head "No need to." "Well I won't ever stop from thanking you" Ryan said and you were about to protest but stopped you by placing his lips on yours, making you smile into the kiss. "Works like a charm." Ryan commented pulling away smiling up at you, making you blush "Oh shush." you said and he replied with a kiss to your cheek at how cute you were.
