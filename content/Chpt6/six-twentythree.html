            "It’s just not fair." you said moving off the bed, making your way towards Ryan "What isn't?" he asked turning to look at you "You." you said leaving Ryan confused "What about me exactly?" he asked with a raised brow, but you just brought your hands up to run along his clothed chest before going to connect them behind his neck "It's not fair for you to be looking this fine." you said leaning up to press kisses into his neck making Ryan chuckle "Well that's out of my control babe." Ryan commented making you kiss up to his jaw then lips, leaving a lingering kiss there. "How am I supposed to keep my hands to myself if you're planning on looking his good for work." you asked, well more like stated as you leaned away and Ryan took hold of your hips looking down at you "That's my dilemma everyday whenever I see you." Ryan said gripping your hips tighter "It sucks you just can't bend me over the computer and have your way with me." you said making Ryan groan so he quickly checked the time "We don't even have time now." he said displeased but you wanted to make him cave "What if we're just a little late, because how you look right now, I'm not allowing us to leave this apartment until I have you just one more time." you said reaching up and saying the last part against Ryan's lips and just what you wanted, he caved crashing his lips against yours and leaning down to take hold of the back of your thighs as he effortlessly lifted you up, wrapping your legs around his torso.

            "Hey babe." Ryan said as he entered the lab making you look towards him with a smile "Hey, how may I help you?" you asked turning back to your screen as Ryan came to stand next to you "Just wanted to see your face, this day is crazy already." Ryan said as he leaned his head on your shoulder making you chuckle "I've heard, you guys are busy, anything I can help with?" you asked making him lean back up "Just me being with you is enough. You're like my charger." Ryan said with a grin making you release a small laugh "That's cute." just as he was about to say something else and he got a called and immediately his face entered a state of annoyance "Are you being serious right now?" Ryan asked whoever was on the other end, so releasing a heavy sigh he hung up "Babe, what's wrong?" you asked turning fully towards him with concern "Our apartment is being searched." Ryan said starting to leave "Let me come with you." you said starting to leave but Ryan turned to stop you "No, stay here and let me handle this." Ryan said sternly "F*** me, this day just keeps getting better." Ryan said sarcastically after kissing your forehead "Just keep me updated." you said and he nodded before leaving. Turning back to your screen, you just didn’t know what to think.

        <p class="story">
            At the same time the whole team, along with officers were searching your apartment, because apparently the device that killed Rebecca was tracked back there. "No one really believes that Ryan or Heather did any of this do you?" Jessie asked as he came down the stairs with a box in hand "Well we know it was someone from the inside, so we do what we gotta do." Calleigh said coming from the direction of the kitchen. The officers were making a mess of the place and that resulted in Walter speaking up "Hey, be careful with this stuff. They're one of us." he shouted towards the officers and at that moment something broke resulting in Walter turning towards that officer "Hey!" he shouted at him "I just don't feel good about doing any of this." Natalia commented as she was looking through picture frames "Yeah, me neither." Calleigh said standing next to her before continuing "I guess just look at it as not searching a suspect but a way to exonerate Wolfe, cause at the end of the day, Heather would be caught up in this." "Yeah, well, Wolfe's here." Walter said looking outside seeing Ryan's car pulled up so he decided to alert everyone "Hey, Wolfe's here." he told the team but Settler inputted "Don't stop searching, okay. Keep searching!" he said sternly so Calleigh sighed "I'll go talk to him." she said before leaving. Arriving Ryan was furious but was granted access inside and while going in he saw some of both your things being taken out the apartment "Hey, what is going here? Is this some kind of joke?" he asked rushing inside then he saw Settler and got more annoyed "What is AI doing here?" Ryan asked pointing at him and Calleigh explained that the device from the explosion tracked backed to his apartment "And you think I had something to do with the bomb? Are you serious?" Ryan asked turning towards Calleigh, he was done being nice "I don't know." Calleigh said devastated "Are you kidding me?!" Ryan asked loudly and started calling everyone out "What are you doing here?" he asked pointing towards Delko "I'm just trying to help." Delko said softly "You're just trying to help?! What's the matter, your investigation with Walter hit a dead end Eric?" Ryan asked sarcastically and they continued their search as Ryan rambled on. While Eric was searching your radio player he spotted something, a diamond, and they all shared a look, before he opened the electronic and saw all the missing diamonds, everyone was in disbelief "Those aren't mine." Ryan stated "Of course they're not, you stole them, or maybe you had Heather do it for you." Settler said making Ryan's blood boil "You keep her name out of your mouth, and neither of us put them there, we know nothing about that!" Ryan shouted defending both you and him "Someone is trying to set me up. You see what's going on here." Ryan pleaded towards Calleigh and she truly didn't know what to believe, Ryan was frustrated now "You guys gotta believe me, someone's trying to set me up here, it's not me and it's definitely not Heather." Ryan pleaded towards his fellow teammates but Settler wasn't having it "Take him please, and call the station to have Mrs. Wolfe taken into custody." Settler said to the officers "Are you guys serious, leave Heather out of this, please." Ryan begged as an officer approached him "No, because you both could be in this together." Settler said giving Ryan a look that made him return a hard look of his own, so not wanting to make things worse, he left with the officer. The whole team was in shock because deep down they knew that you guys didn't do this.

            While you were working an officer came and escorted you out the lab after explaining what happened, taking you into a room to be questioned. Ryan taught you not to fight it and just go with the flow because anything you say can make it worse. Both you and Ryan were questioned about the diamonds, but both of you said you had nothing to do with it, because that's the truth, you guys had no idea how they got there. "Where were you two this morning, you both came into work late?" "We were home. We left and went nowhere except for here." Ryan replied frustrated "But why were you guys late, because according your records, you both are always early, so why was today different? Maybe planting a bomb perhaps?" Settler asked trying to get under Ryan's skin "That's personal, okay." Ryan said with a hard look towards Rick, hoping he catches on because he just doesn't want to talk about his private life, especially to the likes of him "So it's personal now, I can't help you if you're not completely honest with me." Rick taunted and Ryan sighed getting annoyed "We were having sex, okay, is that what you wanted to hear." Ryan said with a shake of his before laying it on the table before him "Okay, but that's not good enough." Rick said before decided to head a new direction and target Ryan's past "Okay, so what happened, you had some old gambling debts to pay off, so you stole the diamond and maybe what, the cars and heroin too?" Settler asked Ryan as he was leaned over the desk tired of this back and forth "I haven't gambled in four years Rick." Ryan stated remaining in his position "Was Nevens getting too close?" Rick said taunting Ryan that was his last straw so he stood up coming face to face with Rick "You think I murdered Nevens? You bet I come out and say it buddy." Ryan said starting to lose his cool again making Rick step back "The evidence that you trust so much, is leading us all your way." "That's how somebody wants it to look doesn't it." Ryan said getting all in Rick's face "Mr. Wolfe, back off. Right now." Horatio warned then Rick explained that Ryan was the last one to see the diamonds "And also they were found in his house, which if you didn't notice, that's where him and his wife lives." Rick said riling Ryan up and explaining more evidence that was pointed towards Ryan "And the fact that the bomb device was tracked from their house, they're both prime suspects here." Rick told H "This is an active investigation my friend." H defended, trying to step in "No, you're done. I let you try it your way and Nevens got killed so cuff him and his wife now please." Settler told the officer in the room and one of them left to go over to arrest you. You both kept quiet cause you know speaking up will make things worse. You and Ryan were escorted out your separate rooms in cuffs and everyone on that floor looked on. You were truly in disbelief, you both were but mostly frustrated and annoyed. Natalia and Jessie were in the lab looking at the diamonds found in you and Ryan's apartment when Walter came through "You guys seeing this?" he asked the two "They're dragging Heather and Ryan away in cuffs." he said going by the door as he looked on. Everyone was quiet as they watched you two being taken away. When the team got sight of you, they were in shock not expecting you to be arrested as well. When the elevator closed on you guys, you and Ryan shared a look, and you saw him apologized with his eyes so you replied back with yours letting him know that it's okay.

            When you both were out of sight Walter looked across to Delko with an annoyed look, because he's responsible for this. "This isn't right." Walter voiced and Delko met his eyes making Walter look away "We've gotta do something." Natalia said looking towards Jessie "Well I'm getting nothing here." Jessie commented looking back at her "Well, whoever framed Heather and Ryan killed Nevens." Natalia stated then she and Jessie got into thinking how to find the real person responsible. Natalia came up with an idea and Jessie followed her as she discussed it "So we need to get elimination samples from everyone in the lab" Jessie said giving her a look "Starting with Heather and Ryan." Natalia added.

            You and Ryan were currently in holding when Frank approached signaling for you both to come and you guys followed him into the interrogation room that Ryan was questioned in. Entering you both saw H and Eric there, so you both sat quietly next to each other waiting for them to speak. And they explained it to you both. "You have the evidence that proves this and clears our names?" Ryan asked and Eric placed an evidence bag with a folder within "This proves it." Eric started and explained what Natalia did and just that moment Rick entered the room. "I got your call Horatio." Rick said "The bacterial DNA was a match." Eric said, with a hint of a smile looking towards him "So we got our man." Rick said looking towards you two "As a matter of fact, we do Rick." H stated and just that moment you and Ryan stood up moving out the way "Why don't you have a seat." H told Rick but instead of sitting he looked between Eric and H, "What's going on?" he asked confused "We ran a bacterial sample from you against the diamonds. You were a match." Eric stated "What are you talking about, you never swabbed me?" Rick asked with a chuckle "No, but you were holding that folder while you were interrogating Heather and I." Ryan said getting in his words " then Rick started to state other things that they don't have enough evidence but they all proved him wrong "You're going down." H stated looking at Rick, and Ryan and Eric confronted him about all the things he tried to pin on them and that's when Rick caved, letting it all out, all the things he did, all the truth was out in the open now and you all looked on as he explained it all and honestly you were not surprised because you never liked the guy to begin with. Then he got to explaining the diamonds "Those diamonds, were going to be it, I just had to wait." he stated and you got mad "You planted those diamonds in the Wolfes' apartment to buy time, that's all." H told Rick then he started his own rant of why he did what he did. You and Ryan shared a look of relief before he moved over towards Rick, taking out his own handcuffs "Get up." Ryan told Rick, making you smile "Get up!" Ryan said again as Rick refused to move "Yeah." he said defeated, so he got up and Ryan started to cuff him "You tried to pin this all on me and my wife." Ryan started as he give you a quick look before turning back to Rick "You're going to prison you son of a bitch." in that moment you have never felt more proud of your husband "Oh I know." Rick said all will lost to fight. So Ryan having him cuffed, pushed him out of the room following after with you guys not far behind. You were walking with Eric as you guys followed behind them towards the elevator, and boy was it an amazing the sight, Rick Settler arrested, your world felt lighter, knowing that you and Ryan were in the clear. Everyone on that floor looked and the rest of team followed behind you all, also happy with what was happening because the threat was neutralized. You all watched the elevators closed on Rick and Ryan made sure he got in the last stare and that the last person that Rick saw was him. After, Ryan turned and came towards Eric as he stood next to you and you could see the relief in Ryan's eyes "I'm glad you had my back man." Ryan said giving him a small smile before reaching forward his hand which Eric took accepting the handshake returning the smile and a nod of his head "Thank you." you said next resting your hand on his shoulder and giving it a caress and he turned giving you a smile as well "Yeah, thank you." Ryan said releasing his hand to give his chest a tap and Delko nodded not knowing what to say cause he felt like he's the one to blame for what you guys went through. Ryan turned to you with a smile and reached out his hand for you to take, which you gladly did, intertwining your fingers with his as you both walked off together smiling.

            You and Ryan stood outside the door anticipating to see the damage within "How was it when you came by?" you asked turning to him and Ryan sighed "Not good." you released a sigh your own before speaking "Okay, let's rip of this band aid." you said making Ryan chuckle and he unlocked the door, so entering he switched on the light, and you both assessed the damage within "Wow." you said shocked looking at the mess the officers left your apartment in "F*** me." Ryan commented making you turn towards him "Yeah, what you said." you said before turning back to the mess and moving into it. Then you were instantly curious about something "Where did they find the diamonds?" you asked looking around and Ryan pointed towards the entertainment center "In the radio." looking there you saw they had it busted open. It truly hurt seeing your home like this, you felt violated, knowing that people have been through your personal things and someone even broke in to plant diamonds to frame you guys. As you were looking around, Ryan was looking at you, watching your reactions. Along with the mess, your mind replayed events of the day and you instantly felt overwhelmed and tears started to well up in your eyes. A home you once made with Ryan seemed like it was torn apart and to stay here would just keep bringing up the memories of what happened. "I don't think I can stay here anymore." you said with a sob and instantly Ryan closed the distance between you two and wrapped his arms around you "We don't have to." Ryan said as he caressed your back, so keeping you shielded, he took you back out the apartment and towards the car. He helped you in and closed the door before leaning into the window "Just wait here babe, while I go and get some things." Ryan said kissing your hand before leaving quickly to return. He entered back the apartment and headed to the bedroom, ignoring the mess and quickly packed a few of your things along with his that he knows you both would need before leaving, locking the door and coming back to you. Resting the duffel bags in the back seat, he got into the driver side and turned to you "Ready to go?" Ryan asked taking your hand in his and you just replied with a nod.

            You were currently in the tub, soaking in water, hoping to relax and ease your mind as Ryan went out to get something for you guys to eat. For now you both were staying at a hotel and Ryan told you not to worry about anything, that he'll take care of it all. Ryan knew you were hurting and you were at your limit. He may have seen a sense of relief left your face, but he saw it all came crashing down on you when you entered the apartment and also the fact that you were arrested for something you knew nothing about. He knew you weren't doing well, so it was time for him to be there for you through this. Entering the suite, he walked over to a table and rest down the bag of food before heading your direction. Upon reaching the bathroom he knocked on the door waiting for your answer "Yeah." he heard you said weakly, so slowing opening the door, his eyes landed on you, and saw that you were crying and hurting "You're back." you said wetting your face before looking up at him. So he placed a small smile on his face before coming over to you "I got your favourite, a chicken sandwich, fries, coleslaw and a milkshake." Ryan said as he stooped down besides the tub to meet your level, and that made you give him a small smile of your own. "Thank you. I'll be out in a sec." you said and Ryan nodded "Don't take too long or I'll drink your milkshake." Ryan joked making you chuckle "You better not." you joked back so he stood up to kiss your forehead, before leaving. Just as promised, you finished washed off yourself and got out wrapping the bathrobe around you. Exiting you saw Ryan was laying out the food on the table, before looking up when heard you come out "You can get started without me while I go and shower." Ryan said coming over to you and placing another kiss on your forehead, and just as he was about to walk away, to pulled on his arm to pull him back before crashing your body against his in a hug and his arms found their way around your body in comfort. Ryan remained quiet just offering the comfort you need so with a sigh, you leaned back your head to look up at Ryan "You know I was really proud of you today." you said wanting to lighten the mood "What do you mean?" Ryan asked looking down at you "When you arrested Rick, it was a beautiful sight." you said with a smile, a genuine one and that made Ryan feel good "I never liked the guy." Ryan said truthfully and you nodded in agreement "I hope he never comes out." and Ryan chuckled "I think he's going to be in there for a long time." hearing that you released a contented sigh "I'm sorry." you told Ryan and he titled his head "What for?" "For being weak right now." Ryan was quick to dismiss that, he shook his head before speaking "No, you're not weak. Do you know how strong you were today, and seeing you like that kept me going knowing that we'll make it out of it. So what you're feeling right now is just the aftermath, and nothing is wrong with that, because baby you're only human." Ryan reassured and you knew he was right "Thank you." you smiled up at him and he returned it "No, thank you, for being my strength today, so now let me be yours." he said making you tiptoe to connect your lips with his in a tender kiss, so pulling away you gripped his cheek "Go shower before I eat your food." you said lightening the mood and Ryan chuckled "Yes mam." Ryan said before placing a quick peck to your lips.

            Food digested and teeth brushed, you and Ryan were currently in bed, watching tv. You laid on his chest while having his arm wrapped around your waist. Lucky for you they had Netflix, so Ryan put on Friends to offer you both comfort but you more than anything. Although you were watching tv, your mind kept wandering from time to time, so sighing you sat up catching Ryan's attention "Everything okay?" Ryan asked looking up at you, so you reached across and turned on the bedside lamp, giving the room some light other than the tv glow "I want to talk." you said sitting crossed leg so Ryan nodded before sitting up and matching your position "What do you want to talk about?" he asked and you took hold of his hands in yours before starting "About what happened, and it's bothering me, and I want to get it out before it eats me alive." you said seriously and Ryan nodded with an 'okay' "Being arrested is something I never imagined happening to me, so yeah, that hurt and had me mad and frustrated knowing that we're being accused for something we didn't do, but also I was terrified. Wondering what was going to happen to us if we actually took the fall for the diamonds, my mind was spiraling with every thought possible but a part of me kept faith knowing that the team would find who were really responsible for stealing the diamonds. When I was interviewed by Rick, he made me so mad, but I kept remembering what you told me, to always keep a cool head in situations like this, to not make it worse for myself but I'm telling you this Ryan, I have never wanted to hurt someone more than I did in that moment." you said all truthfully and Ryan kept his hold on your hands while listening intently "But after finding out he was responsible, the joy that entered me was amazing, and seeing you take him away was satisfying and I released a breathe thinking that it was all over. But then entering the apartment and seeing the mess, everything went through the door, all that joy, satisfaction, it all disappeared because looking at the state of the apartment left me feeling naked. People were in our home Ryan, going through our belongings, destroying things, just disturbing our peace of that place and then remembering the diamonds were found there, that broke me knowing that he broke into our apartment, the place we call home just to plant diamonds to ruin our lives. That's our home Ryan." you said with tears now appearing in your eyes and Ryan pulled you closer to sit in his lap while he wrapped his arms around you "I know baby, and I understand." Ryan said rubbing a hand up and down your back to soothe you. He completely understood because he felt the exact same way. A place you guys created as a sanctuary away from the wrong of the world was ruined. You quickly sobered up before leaning back and Ryan brought a hand up to wipe away your tears and you chuckled "I can't believe I'm allowing a wicked like him make me cry." Ryan chuckled as well, before bringing back down his hand to wrap around your waist "You're right, he's not worth it." Ryan said and you nodded in agreement "Instead of allowing him to kick me down, I'm going to rise above and be better." you said raising your hands making Ryan release a small laugh "I like that attitude. So what are you going to do?" Ryan asked curious and you thought for a moment before replying "Let's get a new place. Let's get a house, like we talked about." you voiced and Ryan's eyes widened "Are you sure?" and you nodded with a grin "I can't go back in that apartment to live, I won't ever feel safe or comfortable there." you said truthfully "I can get onboard with that but a house Heather, that's a big move, can we even afford one?" Ryan said a bit skeptic "Well, I guess it's a good thing I've been saving for one since we got married." you said with a grin and Ryan looked at you surprised "Really?" he asked and you nodded rapidly "It should be enough to make a downpayment on one we like, so that we'll actually own it." Ryan was honestly taken aback because  he had similar intentions as you so he released a chuckle leaving you puzzled "What?" you asked with a smile "I've been saving up for a house as well, there was never a surprise trip, that was to distract you from the big truth." Ryan said with a shy smile making you now look surprised "Really?" you asked and he nodded, so immediately you captured his face in yours "I love you." you said before giving him a passionate kiss, and the moment you both pulled away, Ryan was the first to speak. "And I love you." you once again felt the joy from earlier returned, yeah everything was shit right now, but it was starting to look up "So, I take it we're going house hunting?" you asked with a raised brow "I think we will, when do you want to go?" Ryan asked and you didn't give it a thought "Tomorrow, since we've both been given some time off to get our lives back together." that made Ryan grin "That sounds perfect." Right in this moment, whatever that happened today, was replaced with the now, knowing that something amazing came out of the tragic of the day. You guys may have lost your current abode but home is with each other and you guys will be going somewhere that you'll start fresh, for the rest of your lives
