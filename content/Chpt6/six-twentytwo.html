            "The yellow dress or white dress?" you asked turning to Ryan with both dresses in hand and he looked up looking between the two and he thought for a moment before replying "The yellow one." Ryan said with a smirk and you raised a brow at that "Now I wonder why you picked this one." you said raising the yellow one "You really want to know?" Ryan asked and you nodded "Yes, I really want to know." Ryan chuckled "Well, I'll tell you when you have it on." Ryan said with a raised brow of his own "Okay then."

            When you were finally clothed, wearing the dress Ryan picked he approached you from behind, hand going to rest on your hip "I picked this dress because it shows your curves, in the most beautiful way." Ryan said running his hands along your curves just admiring you "And it works out because I'm wearing yellow today." Ryan added at the end before standing fully behind you now, moving his head to place kisses on the exposed parts of your shoulder "Is this going to be one of those days where I scold you for being handsy while at work?" you questioned and Ryan moved his arms to wrap completely around you now "With the way you look in this dress, most definitely." Ryan said not even denying it making you chuckle "Maybe I should change it, so I don't distract you from work." you said starting to move and Ryan just tightened his hold on you and shook his head "Please don't, I'll behave." that made you turn in his arms "Since when do you know to do that?" you asked with a raised brow and Ryan shrugged "I can try." he said as moved his hands down to rest on your bum "Right, I'll believe it when I see it." you commented based on his actions right now "It's not my fault that I'm completely attracted to you." Ryan stated making you chuckle "We have to leave now or we'll be late for work." you said smoothing down the hair at the back of his neck. Ryan checked his watch to make sure you were indeed correct and he sighed "Father give me strength today." he with eyes closed making you giggle, so you leaned up to give him a quick kiss "You'll survive." you said going back flat on your own two feet smiling up at him "Easy for you to say." Ryan said with a kiss to your forehead.

            Calleigh dropped off video camera footage, for you to go through while she went and checked out something before returning to you. "Turns out there was something going on at the Williams house. The police responded to a 911 hangup call there last month, suspected domestic violence." Calleigh said as she entered the lab coming over to you "Were charges filed?" you asked looking towards her "No, when the police arrived, the husband had taken off and the wife said that everything was fine so they left. I'm hoping the video will speak for them." Calleigh said referring to the footage you were going through "Well I'm sorry, there's nothing that points to the dad on this tape and I can only work with what's within this frame." you said disappointed "Really? So it's just Laura?" Calleigh said with the thought of something "Not exactly. There is someone sharing the frame with her." you stated turning to the screen to play the video "Who?" Calleigh asked curios "A ghost." you said pulling it up before continuing "You see, this tape was used before then recorded over. But the camera must be damaged or something because it didn't fully erase the image." you said going to the part you wanted to show Calleigh "Okay, there, right hand corner, you see the painting?" you asked highlighting it "Barely." Calleigh said shaking her head "Let me just eliminate the current image." you said making it clearer for you guys to see "How about now?" you asked her again "Oh yeah, it's um, a birthday party. Maybe it's one of the kids plays, no, it's a dinner. Can you sharpened that?" Calleigh asked wanting to see it better "If I apply a condensed sensing algorithm, the computer should be able to take what little information they do have and multiply it, filling in the missing pixels" you said working on it "It's thanksgiving." Calleigh stated with a smile seeing the video image clearer now "Hold on a second, let me enhance the video." when done, you both watched the video, and it showed the mother talking very awful to her daughter before grabbing her and dragging her off, you were both stunned at what you just witnessed "Oh my god." Calleigh said shocked "That poor girl." you added before continuing the video "What is the mother doing? Is that a dog bowl?" Calleigh asked looking at the video and it was, the mother was making the daughter eat the dog food from its' bowl "The father wasn't the monster in that house, it was the mother." Calleigh said as you both shared a look at the end. You were honestly disgusted at how wicked some parents could be to their own children.

            "Ugh, she's a monster." you voiced towards Ryan as you got your belongings from the locker "The mom?" Ryan asked giving you a look "Yeah. Like, who does something like that to their children, making him drink lighter fluid. That's messed up." you said feeling sick to your stomach so Ryan offered a comforted hand to your lower back "It sucks but try to not let it get to you babe." Ryan said and you nodded "Yeah, you're right." you said shaking your head trying to dismiss the thoughts but you were still caught up "But still though." you said failing so Ryan chuckled going to quickly peck your lips to stop you "Stop." he instructed with a raised brow so you sighed before smiling "Yes sir." closing both your lockers now, you turned to each other leaning against them and Ryan just kept smiling down at you "What?" you asked wondering what's up with him "You just look really beautiful." Ryan stated before looking around making sure the room was clear, and when he saw it deemed fit, he reached forward his hand to capture your waist pulling you close to him "Ryan, we're at work." you warned and he just shrugged "No one is around and do you know how difficult it was to keep my hands to myself today." Ryan said speaking softly, grip growing tighter "I did realize that, you didn't touch me today, maybe the dress is losing its effect." you said with a shrug at the end and Ryan chuckled "Trust me, it definitely isn't." Ryan said coming closer but was stopped abruptly by a voice "Not you two getting freaky at work, keep it clean." it was Walter as he entered the room making you two distance yourself from each other chuckling "Apologies." you said turning towards him "You speak for yourself." Ryan said making you guys laugh.

            The moment you guys were through the door, Ryan had his hands on you making you chuckle "At least allow me to take off my shoes first." you said with a raised brow and Ryan nodded releasing you. So he stood there and watched  as you took off your shoes, impatiently waiting, bouncing on his heels, making you laugh at him "You're like a child on Christmas morning." you commented standing back up after your shoes were off making Ryan chuckle "I'm about to have my wife all to myself, with no distractions, responsibilities, nothing." Ryan said hands going back to your hips running all along your curves just feeling you up "And you deserve it, because you were very well behaved today." you commented running your hands along the front of his clothed chest, that made him smile down at you and he was about to lift you up but you stopped him "Can't do that in this dress." you told him looking down and then he remembered you were wearing a close fitting dress "Okay then." Ryan said with a smirk and before you had chance to question him, he bent down resting his arm under your bum before lifting up, tossing you over his shoulder making you release a yelp. "Fair play." you said as he headed in the direction of the bedroom.

            "I'm tired." you said as your eyes were closed laying on your stomach "I'm sorry." Ryan said with a chuckle causing you to laugh "Not you, just work. Felt like a long day." you said opening your eyes now to see Ryan was already looking over your features "I thought I tired you out." Ryan joked making you reach across to pinch his side "That's my job." you joked back and Ryan leaned up to place a kiss on your exposed back "I won't deny that." he said while getting up "I'm going to run us a bath." he was off the bed now, and headed for you bathroom "Okay." you said before closing back your eyes. While you were waiting for the bath to be ready, you ended up dropping sleep, not realizing how tired your body was. "Beautiful." Ryan said as he entered back the bedroom, but was met with silence "Babe." Ryan said going around the bed and when he saw your face, he realized you fell asleep, so chuckling to himself and sat down bringing a hand to rub your back "Baby." he said stirring you awake "You sure it wasn't me that tired you out?" Ryan asked jokingly as he saw your eyes opened and you just rolled them with a smile "Maybe I should stay here and let you bathe alone." you said closing your eyes as if you're going back to sleep "Fine, I'll just drag out the bed." Ryan said starting to grab for your thigh so you protested "I'm coming." you said getting up with a laugh "Again? But I didnâ€™t do anything." Ryan joked trying to hold in his laughter so reached across and smacked his chest "I hate you." you said standing up from the bed now, heading towards the bathroom. "Wait for me." Ryan said quickly getting up the bed to join you, once again lifting you off the ground, taking you in his arms before entering the bathroom.
