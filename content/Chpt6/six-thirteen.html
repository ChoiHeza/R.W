            "So he got sliced in half, with a katana?" Jessie asked making sure he heard correctly and Walter nodded "Awful way to go." Walter said while searching away on the surface computer "But who in Miami even owns a katana?" Jessie asked but more like commented "Actually, Heather owns a katana." Walter stated making Jessie whip around his head "She what?" Jessie asked dumbfounded and just that moment you entered the lab "Hey guys." you greeted them heading over to your computer "You own a katana?" were the first words that left Jessie's mouth "Wait, how do you know that? Walter?" you asked first caught off guard then curious, looking towards Jessie then Walter "So it's true?" Jessie asked amazed and you nodded "Yeah, it's a replica of Michonne's katana from The Walking Dead." you told him "Is it real?" "Of course." you said proudly and Jessie was impressed "Sweet." "See, I told you Heather was cool." Walter said making you chuckle.

            When you entered the locker room, you spotted Jessie "Dimples." you greeted making him look towards you with a smile, "Hey, just the person I was hoping to see." he said closing his locker so you made your way over to him "What's up?" you asked as you were in front him so he looked around before looking back to you "I need help with something" you nodded "Sure.". Then he got into explaining about a tracking device he bought and he wants you to help him set it up "Nothing illegal, right Jessie?" you asked skeptical and he reassured you "Of course not, or I wouldn't have asked you but it would be best if this was kept between us." he said keeping his voice low so you thought for a moment "Please." he pleaded as he saw a little hesitation in your face but you eventually caved and nodded "Okay, I'll help you." you replied with a smile which he returned with a bigger one "Thank you so much Heather, I owe you one." you waved your hand with a small laugh "Nonsense, just helping a friend." "Nope, not accepting that, anything you need, let me know." he said sternly this time so you nodded "Okay okay, I won't argue." "Good."

            "Hey babe, I'm home." Ryan said as he entered through the apartment door. "Living room." you called out. After a few moments you saw Ryan entered, jacket discarded "I was expecting to be home before you." Ryan said coming over then plopping down next to you on the sofa, giving you a quick kiss. "Well, the meeting finished pretty early and I could of returned to the lab but I was like 'Nah, let's go home early for once.'" you lied because you actually visited the department after work, there was something you wanted from your locker but after the conversation with Jessie, you promised not to tell anyone so Ryan chuckled "Wellâ€¦" Ryan started pulling you onto his lap "I can get on board with that." he leaned back pulling you along with him to lay down "I heard what happened with Natalia today." you said and Ryan sighed "You weren't too hard on her right?" you asked leaning up to look at Ryan "Not really, I more like scolded her." Ryan said making you chuckle "Scolded, what is she, five?" "Well, I was annoyed at the fact that she could have been killed then and there." you nodded "Understandable, hopefully she goes to a doctor and get it checked out." you said laying back down "Hopefully." Ryan said with a sigh going quiet now, entering resting mode. You were just about to get up but Ryan wrapped his arms around you, holding you in place "No, don't get up." you chuckled and stopped moving "Aren't you hungry?" you asked and Ryan nodded "Yeah, but I'm comfortable like this." he said tightening his arms "Okay Ryan, we'll stay like this as long as you need." "Thank you." Ryan said with a kiss to your forehead before laying his head back with a contented sigh leaving his lips.
