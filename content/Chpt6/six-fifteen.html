            "A man falling from the sky is not something you see every day." Ryan said entering your lab "No it is not." you said as he came next to you "So what have you guys found out so far?" you asked curious "Well, I just came back from cutting off a part of the space ship, that has some micro meteor damage. So I had it dropped off by Travis to see what he can  find." you looked at him surprise "You cut off a part of the space ship?" you asked just making sure you heard right and Ryan nodded with a smirk "I bet you were so smug about it." you said with a chuckle "Of course. You know how I am." Ryan said making you laugh now "Okay CSI Wolfe, so what brings you by?" you asked turning back to your screen "Just killing some time until Travis is ready for me." you chuckled "Okay then. Well I gotta head that way when I'm finished here." Ryan nodded before asking "What are you working on?" you explained the case to him and what you were currently looking for. Just as you were uploading the info to your tablet, Ryan got a call from Travis that he was ready. "I guess we can walk together." you suggested after he hung up and Ryan smiled at that. You both made it to the lab Travis was in first so you decided to pop in just to say hello "If it isn't the famous Heather Wolfe." Travis greeted as he saw you enter the lab with Ryan "And it's always lovely to see you as well Travis." you greeted back in your British. "Are you sure you're not from England, cause you fool me every time you speak in the accent." Travis told so you nodded "I'm sure but it's fun speaking that way." you chuckle "And you do it very lovely." he complimented with a bow which you returned "Okay guys, I'm still here." Ryan commented making you both laugh "Well, I got to get going, see you lot later." you said in a British accent before giving a royal wave while leaving. "Amazing." Travis said referring to your accent with a shake of his head and Ryan gave him a look which made him apologize "Sorry." Travis apologized before getting into what he found.

            You were currently in the locker room with Ryan, when you saw Walter enter "If it isn't Iron Stomach." you commented grinning towards Walter making him sigh "Jessie told you didn't he?" Walter asked heading to his locker and you nodded "Well, in my defense, I thought I could handle." Walter defended making you laugh "It's a good thing I declined that offer." Ryan said "Well, it was fun nonetheless." Walter defended once again "I could imagine, I would of gone." you stated making the two look at you "Really?" Ryan asked interested and you nodded "How often does one get to experience zero gravity." you said with a wide smile "Well if I knew, I would of asked you to join us." Walter told you "It was a great experience, being weightless, was pretty sweet." he continued smiling back at the memory "Alright, you're making me jealous now." you said closing your locker with bag in hand "Maybe I should take you?" Ryan suggested making you look towards him "And you would join?" you asked with a raised brow and Ryan thought for a moment before replying "Why not, can't let you go alone." a smile graced upon Ryan's face which you returned "I would like that." "Wow." came Walter's voice making you both look over to him to see that he was watching the interaction between you two "What?" Ryan asked "I just watched you ask her out on a date." Walter said with a smile making you chuckle "I had to remind myself that you guys were married." he continued making you laugh now "Nothing is wrong with that, he ask me out on dates all the time." you said with a shrug "Arenâ€™t you the romantic one." Walter commented making Ryan puff out his chest "Of course." that made you all laugh.

            "Imagine being sacrificed so everyone else could live, and not having a say in that." you said after Ryan explained to you the cause of death of the victim "And the funny thing is, his wife didn't want him going up there." Ryan added so you turned your body towards him as you both were sitting up against the headboard in bed "How did she take it?" you asked with a heavy heart "Well, at first she was mad about it, not believing he did something so stupid but after watching the video that he left for her, she felt the guilt and pain." your heart sunk at that "I could imagine, I'm sorry for her." you said bringing your knees up to your chest, hugging them. Ryan reached out for you and grabbed your hand "Remember, don't hold onto the feeling, close your heart to it." Ryan reminded you and you nodded "I know, but losing a significant other not knowing the last time you saw them would have been the last, just hurts." you said looking into his eyes and Ryan understood where you were coming from, so he leaned forward and pulled you against him, engulfing you in a hug "I understand." he said offering you comfort, allowing you to crash in his arms. So wanting to lighten the mood you decided to ask "Were you serious about us going on a zero gravity experience?" a small smile gracing your lips and Ryan chuckled leaning back to look at you "Of course, cause you looked like you genuinely wanted to be there with Jessie and Walter." "I really did, it sounded like fun." you said with a pout and Ryan smiled down at you "Well then let's look into it and make it an wedding anniversary event." you grinned at that "I would love that." Ryan found you really adorable in this moment and couldn't contain himself from placing a kiss on cheeks, forehead, nose then lips "Sounds like a date." that statement made you grin even wider.
