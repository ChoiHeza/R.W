        "Walter, the shirts should be delivered today." you said as you closed
        your locker door "That was pretty quick, that mean we'll get to wear
        them tomorrow." Walter said grinning towards "Don't tell Ryan anything
        but I ordered one for him as well, in case he ever changes his mind."
        you commented and Walter looked towards you "I highly doubt that's going
        to happen, with the amount invites he has decline." you nodded "Yeah
        but, I believe in miracles." you said making Walter chuckle "Okay small
        bear. I'll let Jessie know about the shirts." Walter said and you nodded
        before you guys left the locker room to start your shift.

        You were walking in the hallway when Jessie spotted you "Short stuff."
        you heard Jessie called out so you looked towards the direction of his
        voice and saw that he was jogging over to you "Dimples, what's up?" you
        said as he came next to you and you guys continued walking "Walter told
        me about the shirts." he mentioned looking down at you and you nodded
        "Yeah, according to the shipping log, I should get them today, so when I
        get home they should be there." you told him and he grin "Just in time
        for tomorrow." he commented making you grin as well "I know right." with
        that you guys high fived "I'll bring them for you guys tomorrow." you
        said and he nodded. You guys continued talking until you parted ways.

        "Heather, Heather, Heather." came Walter's voice as he entered your lab
        "Three Heathers, this must be serious." you stated looking towards him
        and he held up a photo while coming over to you "This symbol is right
        here is our next clue to the next victim." by the end he was next to
        you, so you looked up at him "And that's it, no writing, nothing?" you
        asked and Walter shook his head "Okay, I guess we start with finding out
        what it means, or represents." you told him "You got it." he replied
        heading over to the next computer so the searching can go a lot quicker.
        Boy was it a tedious process "I still can't believe Jessie won the bet,
        you get his name for you on your shirt." Walter said amongst the silence
        making you laugh "Luck was just on his side, or it's just that you're a
        sore loser." you commented making Walter gasp "Heather Wolfe, you mean
        lady." you chuckled and the moment you were about you reply, your
        computer beeped "I think we've got something Walter." he immediately
        left his post and came to you "It's a brand." he commented looking on as
        the search finalized "It's a cologne." you said looking towards him and
        Walter wasted no time in getting on his phone and giving Natalia a call
        "Thanks small bear." he said throwing a smile your way before leaving
        with the phone to his ear.

        You entered back the lab going next to Dave "My friend, look at this."
        you said showing him something that was on your tablet in hand. Reading
        it over his eyes widen before taking it from your hand "How did they
        manage this?" he asked looking up at you so you shrug before walking
        away "You tell me, but you're the genius." you said with a chuckle as
        you were back in front your screen now and Dave chuckled "No, that's you
        Mrs. Wolfe, but I will do my best." Dave said pumping his fist making
        you grin "That's the spirit!" you encouraged pumping your fist as well.
        About fifteen minutes passed before a third person entered the lab "It
        is rare seeing you both in here at the same time." it was Jessie "Well,
        it has been a busy kind of day." you commented "So what do you need?"
        you asked turning to him and he held up a memory chip "I need to find
        out what's on this." he said and you looked towards Dave "You're soon
        finished there right?" you asked him and Dave nodded "Yeah, just about."
        he replied so you turned back to Jessie "Is it urgent?" you asked him
        "Not necessarily." he replied "Okay, well we've both caught up in
        something, but Dave should soon be finished, so he'll look at it." you
        told him "Yeah, I could do that." Dave said quickly giving you both a
        look "Thanks guys." Jessie said giving Dave the memory card before
        leaving.

        "Heatherâ€¦, did you do something?" Dave asked as he looked at his screen
        in confusion "Me? How could I be capable of this." you said experiencing
        the same problem as him "Think it's the server?" Dave asked looking up
        and you nodded "I think it is." you said with a sigh and Dave joined
        "Well, we know what we gotta do." Dave commented "Find the problem and
        fix it." you sighed starting to make a move towards the servers but
        something outside the lab caught your eye "What's going on?" you asked
        and Dave followed your line of sight, people were coughing and just as
        Dave was about to say something, a cough came out instead so you quickly
        looked towards him "Dave?" you called starting to go closer but the same
        fate befell you, cough after cough left your mouth, stopping you in your
        tracks. Suddenly everything started going blurry and breathing got
        harder, and with the constricted air ways, you started feeling faint,
        and before you know it you were passed out on the floor along with
        everyone else on that floor.
