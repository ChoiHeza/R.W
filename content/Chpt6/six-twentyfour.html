            "Walter, the shirts should be delivered today." you said as you closed your locker door "That was pretty quick, that mean we'll get to wear them tomorrow." Walter said grinning towards "Don't tell Ryan anything but I ordered one for him as well, in case he ever changes his mind." you commented and Walter looked towards you "I highly doubt that's going to happen, with the amount invites he has decline." you nodded "Yeah but, I believe in miracles." you said making Walter chuckle "Okay small bear. I'll let Jessie know about the shirts." Walter said and you nodded before you guys left the locker room to start your shift.

            You were walking in the hallway when Jessie spotted you "Short stuff." you heard Jessie called out so you looked towards the direction of his voice and saw that he was jogging over to you "Dimples, what's up?" you said as he came next to you and you guys continued walking "Walter told me about the shirts." he mentioned looking down at you and you nodded "Yeah, according to the shipping log, I should get them today, so when I get home they should be there." you told him and he grin "Just in time for tomorrow." he commented making you grin as well "I know right." with that you guys high fived "I'll bring them for you guys tomorrow." you said and he nodded. You guys continued talking until you parted ways.

            "Heather, Heather, Heather." came Walter's voice as he entered your lab "Three Heathers, this must be serious." you stated looking towards him and he held up a photo while coming over to you "This symbol is right here is our next clue to the next victim." by the end he was next to you, so you looked up at him "And that's it, no writing, nothing?" you asked and Walter shook his head "Okay, I guess we start with finding out what it means, or represents." you told him "You got it." he replied heading over to the next computer so the searching can go a lot quicker. Boy was it a tedious process "I still can't believe Jessie won the bet, you get his name for you on your shirt." Walter said amongst the silence making you laugh "Luck was just on his side, or it's just that you're a sore loser." you commented making Walter gasp "Heather Wolfe, you mean lady." you chuckled and the moment you were about you reply, your computer beeped "I think we've got something Walter." he immediately left his post and came to you "It's a brand." he commented looking on as the search finalized "It's a cologne." you said looking towards him and Walter wasted no time in getting on his phone and giving Natalia a call "Thanks small bear." he said throwing a smile your way before leaving with the phone to his ear.

            "Heatherâ€¦, did you do something?" Dave asked as he looked at his screen in confusion "Me? How could I be capable of this." you said experiencing the same problem as him "Think it's the server?" Dave asked looking up and you nodded "I think it is." you said with a sigh and Dave joined "Well, we know what we gotta do." Dave commented "Find the problem and fix it." you sighed starting to make a move towards the servers but something outside the lab caught your eye "What's going on?" you asked and Dave followed your line of sight, people were coughing and just as Dave was about to say something, a cough came out instead so you quickly looked towards him "Dave?" you called starting to go closer but the same fate befell you, cough after cough left your mouth, stopping you in your tracks. Suddenly everything started going blurry and breathing got harder, and with the constricted air ways, you started feeling faint, and before you know it you were passed out on the floor along with everyone else on that floor.
