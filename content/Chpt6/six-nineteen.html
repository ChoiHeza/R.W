            "Let's ditch work today and spend this last day together." Ryan said keeping your body against his as you both were still in bed. "I really wish, we should of requested today off together." you said feeling the same need as Ryan "I don't want you to leave me." you chuckled placing a hand on his cheek "I'm not leaving you, I'm just going away for a little bit." that statement did not help Ryan feel better one bit "Even that still sucks." you looked at the time before turning back to Ryan. Pushing him over to straddle his waist, you leaned down towards him "Instead of moping about me leaving let's make most of the time we have left." when you said that, Ryan removed his grip from your thighs, moving it to your hips "Okay, I could get on board with that." Ryan said making you smile down at him "Perfect." you said before placing your lips on his.

            The work day start crazy, three deaths, resulting in three different crime scenes, and Ryan just wasn't in the mood, just wanted to spend the majority of his day with you before you left, but because how the magnitude of the case, you guys barely got to see each other. You were heading down to the morgue to update a program on one of the computers there, and your trips down there are very rare. Entering through the doors, you just saw how busy it was, having three bodies does that but there was currently only two other people in there with Tom. "Tom." you greeted as you entered the room to alert him of your presence "Mrs. Wolfe, what a pleasant surprise, I never see you down here." he said looking up from the body he was working on "Well, I was summoned. A program needed updating?" you asked and recognition crossed his face "As yes, the one up there." he said pointing upwards, at a room that overlooks the morgue. He was about to say something else but his phone rang, telling you to hold on a minute. So you waited and watched til he was finished. At the end his face had a look of shock while staring at the phone in his hand before putting it down "Everything okay?" you asked and he slowly blinked before turning back to you "Your husband, he just hung up on me." you sighed "I apologize Tom, he's in a bad mood because I'm for Las Vegas today." you said with sorrow "No need, I'm accustom to Ryan's rudeness. You two are like peas of two different ponds." Tom said making you chuckle "I mean it. Heather you truly are one of the kindest and nicest person I've ever met." he said truthfully making you smile "Thank you Tom, and I can say the same thing about you. How about this, since you're a doll, I am going to bring you a signed book from Dr. Raymond and one on one pointers from him." you told Tom with a wide smile which he looked at you in shock "Really?!" he asked in disbelief and you nodded "Really. I like you." you said resting a hand on his arm and he returned the gesture "Thank you Heather, I really appreciate it, and I like you too, wish I could say the same about your husband." you laughed "I'll talk to him. Now is it that I need to do?" you asked and Tom directed you.

            Ryan was currently in the lab with Travers watching and waiting as he ran samples on hair that was found at one of the crime scenes "Not that it's any justification to murder anyone, but from the sound of it, those three were asking for it." Travers said while working giving Ryan a quick look "Oof, Michael, that's a little dark." Ryan told him surprised by what he said then Travers explained why he thought that "Well, when you put it that way.." Ryan said agreeing somewhat "It's funny because Heather would say the exact same thing." "Great minds think alike." Travers said giving Ryan a look and just that moment Frank entered the lab, to see if they had any luck identifying the hair. While they were discussing what Travers found, Ryan came up with an idea "I think I know how we can identify this girl." Ryan said looking towards Frank "How?" he asked curious "Let's pay a visit to my wife. Thanks Travers" Ryan said before leaving with Frank following after him.

            "I finally get to see your beautiful face." you heard Ryan's voice as he entered the lab, but you weren't alone, Dave was behind you on the other computer "Aw, thank you Ryan." Dave joked making you laugh "Good one." you said as you reached behind and you both high fived "Yeah, funny, anyways Frank and I come seeking assistance." Ryan said before getting into explaining. "This is the photo of Joe Quinn from the initial police report." you said pulling up the photo on screen of the pranked victim "You uh, manipulating the photo?" Frank asked looking between you and the screen "With the visualization software, think of it like a weight loss simulator." you explained to him "So we can play around with it and see what someone may look like a hundred pounds lighter" you said making the girl smaller "There." you said she started to look familiar to Frank "You got to be kidding me. Can you make her brunette?" Frank asked "Yeah, of course." you said giving the girl brown hair "You recognize her Frank?" Ryan asked him "Do I ever, Calleigh and I met her at the Seal Blue bar today." Frank replied "Well, that's your girl." you said giving him a glance "Thanks Heather." Frank said before leaving but Ryan stayed behind "Not going with him?" you asked Ryan looking towards him now and he shook his head "Not yet, what do you think, about what she did?" Ryan asked you curious and you thought for a moment before replying "Well, the murder was wrong but they deserved it, after what they put her through, I don't feel for them at all." you said honestly and Ryan listened "You know, Travers just told me the exact same thing." you shrugged at that "It's common sense." you said before turning back to your screen.

            "Heather, you have to bring me back a souvenir, or better yet." Walter said before reaching into his pocket, to pull out his wallet, to give you a hundred dollar bill "Put this on seventeen black." you laughed taking the money from him "You want me to gamble for you?" you asked and he nodded "Of course, you might get beginners luck." he said and you looked at the money before looking back at him "Are you sure?" you asked and he nodded "I'm sure and if it doesn't pay out, bring me a keychain." you chuckled "I think I can do better than a keychain." you said and just that moment Jessie and Ryan entered "Are we talking souvenirs?" Jessie asked and both you and Walter nodded "Well I want one too, whatever you get him, get me." Jessie said heading to his locker "How about I get you guys matching necklaces?" you joked and they chuckled "But don't worry, I'll bring back souvenirs for all of you." you said "And don't forget, seventeen black." Walter said with a pointed finger "You having her gamble for you?" Jessie asked surprised "Yeah, he said something about me having beginners luck." you said and Ryan decided to step in "No no, no gambling." Ryan said and you gave him a look "Really now?" you asked with a raised brow and Ryan thought for a moment "If it's just for Walter, then I guess it's okay." Ryan sighed and you smiled at that.

            You were at the airport, and Ryan was currently helping you take your suitcases out the car "This day got here too quickly." Ryan commented taking out the last suitcase "That only means, that I'll be back here before you know it." you said standing in front him fully and Ryan sighed before taking you in his arms "I wish I could keep you with me, but I am very proud of you." Ryan said smiling down at you and you returned it "Thank you baby." he leaned down and kissed your lips which you accepted and he held you there for a while, before pulling away and embracing you in a hug "I'm going to miss you." he said inhaling your scent "And I'm going to miss you too." you hugged him tighter. You guys didn't want to let go, but you had to because you didn't want to miss your flight "I have to go Ryan." you said hoping he would release you "Not yet." he said making you chuckle "I have to, or I'll miss the flight." you said and this time he sighed before pulling away "Okay." he looked down at you with a love filled smile "I love you." he said first "And I love you. I'll be back before you know it." you said grinning before reaching up to give him one last kiss. He finally let you go, and you took the suitcases in hand, ready to walk away. You turned and waved with a wide smile which Ryan copied making you giggle as you started to walk away Ryan called for you "Wait Heather." he said making you look back towards him "What is it?" you asked and watched as he took off his jacket, before walking over to you and placing it on your shoulders "Why?" you asked him as you pushed your hands through the sleeve "Just something of me to have with you." he said and you chuckled "It's a good thing I don't have a bunch of your t-shirts with me to sleep in." you said with a shy smile and Ryan's eyes widen "What?" Ryan said resulting in you starting to walk away "Oh no, I have to go." you said before blowing him a kiss and practically sprinting away with suitcases rolling along with you, Ryan chuckled and shook his head at your behaviour as he watched you leave. He saw when you sneakily packed some of his shirt in your suitcase, but he said nothing, and just watched you from the corner of his eye. That gestured warmed his heart. He watched you until he could see you no more, before leaving.
