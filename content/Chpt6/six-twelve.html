            "What time would you get to the lab?" Ryan asked looking down at you as you helped him button his cuffs "I guess around my lunch time." you replied "Want to have lunch together?" you thought for a moment before looking up at him "I guess we could do that." you said making Ryan frown "You don't sound too enthusiastic about that. Something wrong?" there was concern in his voice so you shook your head "It's nothing really, just haven't really had much of an appetite during the day." you said looking back at his sleeve to finish the last button. That worried Ryan "From since when?" you entered a state of thought again "Been a week now I think." now Ryan was worried "That doesn't sound like nothing Heather. Are you feeling ill?" he asked making you look up at him and you shook your head "I'm fine Ryan, really." you said giving him a small smile before moving away. Ryan wasn't buying what you were telling him but he decided to drop it for now and keep a closer eye on you.

            When you returned to the lab, you both had lunch as promised, with an addition of Walter. You all three were joking away and laughing and talking, but the whole time Ryan kept an eye on you and realized you didn't touch any of your food. "That's easy, Michonne." you answered Walter's question when he asked who was your favourite character from The Walking Dead "I have feeling you would of said her." "You know, I have katana replica, just like hers." you said making Walters eyes widen "No way." you nodded "Yes way." you said with a chuckle and Walter turned to Ryan "Is that true?" Walter asked him clearly not believing you. Ryan was lost in thought, so he currently wasn't hearing the conversation between you and Walter. You both shared a look and smile before turning back to Ryan "Wolfe." Walter called again and still nothing so you leaned forward and waved your hands in front of Ryan and that worked so you both chuckled at Ryan "Welcome back Wolfe." Walter said before asking his question again "I was asking if it's true that Heather has a Michonne katana replica?" Ryan chuckled "Yeah, it's true. She has it displayed above the tv in the living room." you gave Walter the 'believe me now' look right before your phone ringing "This is work. I gotta head back to the lab." you said starting to pick up your box that contained your food, but Ryan told you leave it, that he'll take care of it. So they all bid you 'bye' before you left. The only reason Ryan asked you to leave your box is because he wanted to see if you ate anything. "Hungry there Wolfe?" Walter questioned as he watched Ryan reach for your box, and he shook his head "No, I want to see if Heather ate anything." when he looked in the box, he saw that you barely touched your food "Something going on?" Walter asked curious "I'm not sure. She said she hasn't had an appetite during the day, but she keeps insisting that she's fine." Ryan said closing the box before turning to Walter "Doesn't sound fine to me, how long has it been going on?" Walter asked concerned now as well "She said a week." Walter widened his eyes at that "Whoa, that is not good." Ryan shook his head "I don't know what to do." Ryan voiced with a sigh "Well, you could try talking to her again or wait till she talks." Walter suggested and Ryan nodded "Let's head back" Ryan said starting to get up and Walter followed.

            "I will be right back." Dave told you as he left the lab "Got it." not even a minute went by before you heard the door open again "That was pretty quick." you said thinking it was Dave but a different voice came "You were expecting me hun?" Ryan asked and you turned greeting him with a smile "Oh Ryan, I thought it was Dave." "Sorry to disappoint, where is he actually?" Ryan asked standing next to you now "Went for a bathroom break, need something?" you asked and Ryan lifted a box that was in his hand "I have cameras and phones for him to retrieve some footage from." "You could just rest it there for when he returns." you gestured towards Dave surface computer, so Ryan went and rest the box down before returning back to your side, so he gave you a long look before asking "You doing okay babe?" you looked towards him with a smile "Of course, why do you ask?" Ryan was contemplating if to bring up you not eating lunch but he decided against it, so he shook his head before replying "No reason, well I gotta get back to work, and let Dave know about the footage for me." Ryan said hand going to your lower back "I will." you gave him a smile which he returned, giving your back a tap before leaving.

            "What do you feel like eating?" you asked Ryan as you both headed to the kitchen "Doesn't matter honestly. Cook what you feel like eating" he replied while taking off his jacket "I'm not hungry, so I'll just cook something for you." you said as Ryan stopped by the island watching you "How are you not hungry, you haven't eaten anything for the day?" Ryan asked folding his arm and you shrugged "I'm just not." you said starting to fill a pot with water "Babe, that's not normal. You have to eat something." you gave him a look "Well I'm not hungry." you said putting the pot to boil before starting to leave the kitchen "Okay, and that's not normal." Ryan said following after you "So what are you going to do, trap me to a chair and force feed me." you said entering the bedroom and Ryan sighed "Of course not, but it worries me not seeing you eating." Ryan voiced his concerned while grabbing you halting your movements "Stop for a moment please, and talk to me." you sighed and met his eyes "I'm worried about you Heather." Ryan said making you sigh "It's nothing Ryan." he gave you a deadpan look "Bullshit, but since you keep saying it's nothing, you won't mind me taking you to the doctor tomorrow." Ryan said sternly with a tilt of his head "Come on Ryan." and he shook his head "No Heather, you're not escaping this one, unless you have other information for me." you sighed defeated. "Fine." you pulled Ryan along with you to sit. "Okay, I've been just feeling pretty stressed late I guess." you voiced your problems "And just feel like I'm just moving, not living." you said trying to explain and Ryan was trying his best to understand "So you want a break?" Ryan asked and you shook your head "No, I'm just in a down time of sorts." you said with a chuckle "It's hard to explain, but I'm fine and I'm not sad or anything. Just down." you reassured him while giving his hand a squeeze "And you not eating?" he asked "While my life currently doesn't feel like my own, me deciding to eat or not is something at least I have control over." you said in hope he understood "But if you don't eat, you'll get sick." Ryan said worried and you sighed "I will be fine." you said again "This not the first time, and I do eat, just not as much as usual, so please don't push me." you said sternly at the end and Ryan sighed "You know I'm just worried right?" he asked bringing a hand up to grasp your cheek and you nodded "I know and thank you, so just be supportive of this, please." you pleaded with him and he sighed before nodding "As much as I hate it, and not fully understand, I won't force you and allow you to move at your pace." he said giving you a comforted smile and you smile back "Thank you." you said bringing his face closer to give him a tender kiss "Always Heather, whatever you need." that made you smile wider.

            You were currently in the bathroom brushing your teeth while Ryan leaned against the door frame watching you "Going to watch me forever?" you asked meeting his eyes in the mirror and he sighed pushing himself off the frame coming towards you "I apologize for being a husband that worries." Ryan said sarcastically making you roll your eyes "Can't you just let it go?" you asked after spitting out and Ryan shook his head "Of course not, and will that annoy you, yes, but I don't care. Because I love you and whatever is affecting you affects me too." Ryan said truthfully while folding his arms and you sighed before turning back to brushing your teeth. Ryan watched you the whole time, until you were finished "You can be a pest sometimes, you know that" you stated looking towards him and Ryan nodded "I know." Ryan said smugly and you just shook your head, starting to leave the bathroom and Ryan followed after you taking hold of your waist from behind, head going into your neck to place kisses "You do know that I care and love for you right?" Ryan asked resting his head on your shoulder so you rested your hands on top of his "I know you do and I'm sorry if I'm being difficult right now." you commented and you felt Ryan shake his head "No you're not, you're going through something, and that's okay, still worries me but it's okay." he said with a chuckle at the end "Thank you." you said while turning in his arms "For in sickness or in health, right?" Ryan smiled down at you and you nodded, before connecting your lips with his, being thankful that he's here with you.
