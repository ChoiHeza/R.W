            "Small bear, I'm surprised to see you awake and alive." came Walter's voice as he entered your lab, you didn't even look his direction when replying "Me too hun, Ryan had to wake me up." you said and Walter laughed "And I never have to do that." came Ryan's voice next that made you look back because you thought Walter was alone "Thanks for that." you said with a smile towards Ryan and then looked towards Walter "And no thanks you for that." you said giving Walter silt eyes and he raised his hands in defense "I had the same amount of drinks as you." he said in his defense and you just sighed "Yeah and because you're built like a bear, those did you nothing." you sulked and the guys laugh at you "You'll know better next time." Ryan scolded so you waved your hand turning back to your screen. "Yeah yeah." "Let me know when your headache starts back, I'll get you more painkillers." Ryan said towards you "Thanks babe, I will." you turned to give him a smile before turning back continuing your work. Will tablet in hand, you turned towards the others and saw they were still working while discussing something, so looking on and observing them you had to make a commit on how they look "You guys look like the Barbados flag." you said coming over to them, going to Walter's side and they looked at each other "Oh yeah, with you standing next to Walter, you completed it." Ryan said noticing "Do you miss it there?" Walter asked and you nodded "I do, just a bit. More like my family than the island itself. But some of the fast food from there I miss." you said smiling recalling the memory of the last time you were home "I could imagine." Walter said and you nodded "But I'm more happy here." you said truthfully looking between the two, you saying that made Ryan feel better because he was worried that you were starting miss home "Anyways, I gotta go." you said gesturing to the tablet in your hand "Okay, see you later beautiful." Ryan said sending you a wink and Walter told you bye as well before you left.

            You and Ryan were currently in the kitchen, he was cleaning the dishes while, you were sat at the island on your laptop working " How much do you miss home?" Ryan asked without turning to you "Just a little bit, not really the lifestyle as much because I never really blend in there, but the food, I miss the food. Cooking it is okay but like buying it or having it cooked for you just hits different." you said full on Bajan making Ryan laugh, turning to you now "I think I understood everything you just said." you chuckled at that "What didn't you get?" you asked "I got it all, you talked about food and that it tastes or in your case, hits, different when cooked by someone else." you nodded "You get it, you're understanding me more and more." you said and Ryan laughed "That's because you're making it easy for me." then something crossed your mind that you totally forgot to tell Ryan "Oh my gosh babe, I totally forgot." you said saving your work before pulling down your laptop close "What is it?" Ryan asked drying his hands before coming over to you "I have to travel soon." "Ryan raised his brows "Where, Barbados?" Ryan asked and you shook your head "No, Las Vegas." you said with a smile "Whyâ€¦?" he asked and you chuckled "I have to go to the Las Vegas crime lab to set up my program there, and teach the team." you said with a proud smile and Ryan came closer to you with a wide smile "Really?" he asked and you nodded "You are amazing." Ryan said taking you in his arms, which you accepted "Thank you." you said before he pulled away keeping you at arm's length "So when do you leave?" Ryan asked looking down at you "In a couple weeks." you replied "And how long will you be gone for?" you brought your hand up to run through his hair, bringing it to the back of his head before replying "Could be up to a month." Ryan's heart sank at that "A month?" he asked just to be sure he heard right and you nodded "It's just to make sure they're all familiar with the program and  everything runs smoothly before I leave." you told him and that still didn't make Ryan feel any better "Don't get me wrong, I am very happy for you and super proud, but a month away." Ryan said voicing his thoughts "Well, we have been apart longer than that." you said and Ryan sighed "Yeah, but we were separated and not talking to each other but at least we were still in the same city. This is different." Ryan stated and you nodded "I know, but we will keep in touch every day and that month will go by before you know it." Ryan said "It's just going to be weird knowing you're not near me if something happens to you, how can I keep you safe, if you're going to be in a different state." you moved your hands to capture Ryan's face "Well, I will be surround by a CSI the whole time, and I promise to be extra careful whenever I do anything." you said hoping to settle Ryan's heart "I don't know, I can't imagine being away from you." Ryan said tightening his arms around your waist so you chuckled and before tiptoeing to kiss his lips "Me too, but I'm not leaving just yet." you said smiling up at him and Ryan moved to lift you up, making you wrap your legs around him "Well, let's enjoy each day you have left, because I need to leave an impression on you so that when you leave, you aren't looking for another man." Ryan said making you chuckle "You know that won't happen." you said as Ryan rest you down on top the island counter "Not even when you get all needy?" Ryan questioned raising a brow at you "I'll just call you." Ryan moved his hands from your thighs to grip your hips pulling you closer to him "Phone sex, hmm. That's new." the smile on Ryan's face widened making you chuckle "A plus with me being away, we get to experience and try something new." you said hoping to cheer up Ryan "I guess it's a plus but - " you cut him off "Let's live in the now, no buts." you said gripping his neck before pulling him in for a kiss before he could protest some more and Ryan gladly accepted it, forgetting what you guys were talking about, deepening the kiss.
