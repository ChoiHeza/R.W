            "Don't miss me too much today." you told Ryan as he clasps your heels for you "Babe, why must you always ask me to do the impossible." Ryan said making you chuckle "I'm sorry but the way you weren't allowing me to leave bed this morning makes me think that it's going to be one of those days." you said with a raised brow looking down at him and he gave you a look "Everything okay babe?" you asked with a hint of concern in your voice and he looked up at you offering a smile "I'm okay, don't worry about it." he said before kissing your thigh, allowing it to rest back on the floor "But if it is something or becomes anything you'll tell me right?" you asked as Ryan stood up now, taking you in his arms. He nodded "I will, but it's nothing. I promise." he reassured you with a smile "Okay." you smiled at him before pecking his lips "We're still on for tonight right?" you asked after you pulled away and smoothed down the hair at the back of head "Of course, I wouldn't miss any opportunity to see my wife in a sexy dress." Ryan said running his hands down your sides from your waist to hips to bum but you were quick to stop him, bringing his hands back up to your lower back while lacing your fingers through his "Don't start something you can't finish Mr. Wolfe." you warned Ryan and he groaned "Fine." Ryan sulked making you smile, so you leaned up closer to him and went to his ear before whispering "But we'll have more than enough time tonight." then you placed a kiss below his ear before pulling away and that caused Ryan to groan "You just love being a tease don't you." you just shrugged before walking away "You love it." you said and Ryan could not disagree with you because indeed he actually did.

            The work day went by pretty quickly and Ryan was in the locker room quickly get his belongings. At that moment Jessie and Walter entered having a conversation between themselves. When they spotted Ryan Walter called out to him "Wolfe, we're heading out for some drinks, you coming along?" Walter asked as he went to his locker and at that moment Ryan closed his "I can't make it this evening, it's date night." Ryan said grinning and both Walter and Jessie chuckled at Ryan's response "Of course, and we can't keep you from that." Jessie commented then continued "Tell short stuff hello for us, we missed her today." "I second on that." Walter said making Ryan chuckle "You got it. See you guys tomorrow." they all bid there byes before Ryan left.

            You were home before Ryan, and you were done showered, dress picked out and currently just in your underwear lying in bed on your laptop waiting till Ryan came home. It wasn't long before you heard his voice announcing that he's home then you heard him enter the bedroom. You were laying on your stomach so you didn't see him when he entered. The first thing that escaped his lips was a whistle then "Now this is a nice view." you just chuckled before sitting up then turning around "Hello to you too Ryan." you said as you face him now and saw he had a wide smile on his face "I am just but your husband." Ryan said making his way over to you on the bed then he looked down at you before continuing "Hello beautiful." he said taking hold of your hand pulling you up so he could place a tender kiss on your lips. When he pulled away, he shifted his hands to grip your hips "I didn't had you waiting too long right?" Ryan asked so you shook your head "No, but we still have some time." you said after checking the clock. There was something about the position you both were in that Ryan was liking, that he slowly started to run his hands towards your bum "You know there's something about this that I'm loving." he said while moved his hands "What do you mean?" you asked unsure of what he meant "You barely wearing anything, while I'm fully clothed." Ryan said while lowering his head going to your neck, placing lingering kisses making you hum but you have to stop him "We don't have enough time for this Ryan." you tried to scold him but it came out soft "I know but this is pay back from this morning." the moment those words left his mouth, he pulled himself away from you with a smirk and a kiss to your forehead. Still in a haze, it took you a while to catch on to what he meant, then you remembered what you did this morning and that caused you to release a sigh "I deserve that." you mumbled going back to lay on the bed making Ryan chuckle "I still love the view though." Ryan commented leaning over to squeeze your bum cheek so you smacked his hand away "Go and shower Wolfe and leave me be." you said trying to sound annoyed but a giggle escaped from you making Ryan release a small laugh. "Yes mam." with that Ryan dropped a kiss to your lower back "By the way, the guys said hello and they missed you today." that brought a smile to your face "Will I missed my big bear and dimples as well." you said and that made Ryan chuckle and shake his head "These nicknames you guys have for each other." Ryan said before shedding his clothes and heading to the bathroom.

            When you knew that Ryan was soon going to finish his shower, you moved from your position on the bed and slowly started to get ready. Just as you were slipping on your dress, Ryan exited the bedroom "Need help?" Ryan asked making his way towards you "Yeah." you answered because you can't reach the zip, so Ryan approached behind you and took hold of the zip taking his sweet time pulling it up by placing kisses along your back before it was covered with the fabric of the dress. When he reached the top he placed a lingering kiss on the exposed part of your left shoulder "Enjoying yourself there." you asked him with a chuckle and he met your eyes in the mirror "Of course." he placed one more kiss before standing fully now and moving away from you "Spin for me." he said while moving his finger in the action, so you released a giggle before doing as told, when you came to a stop, he looked at you in awe "Gorgeous." he complimented not being  able to take his eyes from you and that made your face heat up, "Thank you. Now it's your turn to get gorgeous." you sent a wink his way before disappearing to the bathroom to finish your last touches.

            You entered back the bedroom and saw that Ryan just finished button up his last button, before looking up at you "Whenever you wear that lipstick, I know the kind of night I'm in store for." Ryan said making you chuckle "You don't know that." you said with a raise brow heading over to the shoe rack "But oh, I do know." he said confidently "Because not once has otherwise happened." he stated and he did have a point, so with decided shoes in hand, you headed over to him "Okay wise guy, help please." you said raising up the heels before him and he smiled towards you "Of course." he said taking the shoes from you before heading towards the bed to sit. One after the other, he was very gentle putting on your shoes, like you were made of glass. So when both feet were firmly on the floor, you head over to the mirror to fully look over yourself, while Ryan remained sitting, watching your every move. "How did I get so lucky." Ryan said under his breath but you heard him say something "You said something?" you asked turning to him and he stood up "I just said you look beautiful." he said with a smile approaching you "And you look quite handsome." you complimented the moment he was in front of you, taking hold of his face "The down side to you wearing this lipstick is that I can't kiss your lips without making a mess." you blushed at that "Well, I can kiss you though." you said with a hint of something and Ryan was curious, so before he had time to question, you leaned up and placed two kisses in his neck, leaving behind two lip shaped marks. "There you go." you said and Ryan turned to look in the mirror and saw that the marks were very visible and that caused a smile to appear on his face because he loved it "I think it's a nice look on you." you commented watching his reaction then looking at them yourself "I agree." he said before turning back at you and taking hold of your hips "Let's hurry and leave before we never make it to dinner." Ryan said holding back himself from taking you and having his way with you, so you just smiled at the effect you have on him "You got it." you said with a wink before walking away. You heard Ryan take a deep breathe, then swore under his breathe before following you. You'll be surprised if you guys stay for the whole dinner.
