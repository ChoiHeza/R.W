            "The need to stay home in my bed with my husband is strong." you said turning towards Ryan with a sigh and he just chuckled "And you know I would gladly accept it." Ryan said as he brought your body closer to his, arm wrapping tightly around your waist. "Babe, what are you trying to do to me?" you asked looking at him and he chuckled "Hopefully trying to get you to call in sick and spend the day with me." the moment those words left Ryan's mouth you groaned because everything in your body wanted to do what he said "This is evil." you said sighing, while bringing your hand up to caress Ryan's cheek before continuing "I have a lot of work to do today because it's Dave's off day." you said sighing even more heavily and Ryan gave you sad eyes "I'm sorry." "It's not your fault." you said giving him a look before closing the distance even more between you two "At least I have one more hour before I have to get out of bed." you said and that caused Ryan to smirk down at you "An hour is more than enough time." Ryan said before connecting his lips with yours.

            You arrived at work with a heavy sigh, cause you really just felt like staying home but pushing it aside, you put your stuff away in your locker before heading up to start your day. Since Dave was out today, you'll be working on multiple cases, so heading down the hallway looking for a fellow co-worker. "Steve!" you called when you saw him exit the elevator "Hey, I was just heading your direction." you both met half way "Well I guess I saved you the walk." you told him holding up your tablet and he smiled at that before you guys got into discussing the case. While you both were talking, a guy wearing a motorcycle helmet got off the elevator and released a flash grenade catching everyone off guard and you all fell to the ground when the bang and flash went off. He started shouted orders "You come with me." he said pointing his shotgun at Steve and you both shared a looked before he got up, following the man's order and he took three other people with him and locked them in the weapons locker room. When the coast was clear, you all that were there slowly got up and tried to access what just happened.

            Ryan was hope when he got a call of the situation and was asked to come out to work. You immediately crossed his mind, hoping you were alright. While getting ready, he called you several times but your phone kept going to voicemail, so he prayed the worst didn't happen to you.

        <p class="story">
            You all that were on that floor were carefully evacuated and taken to a spot that was set up for medical help. You suffered from a little bruises here and there so you were waiting to currently get checked up on. You just kept thinking and hoping that Steve would be okay. Ryan arrived at the station pretty quickly and asked for you and he was told where everyone involved was taken to get checked out. Speed walking, almost running and he reached the room and threw the door open, quickly scanning around for you, hoping that you were there and not one of the hostages. After searching he saw you and wasted no time getting to your side "Heather." Ryan called out the moment he was near you and a smile graced your face "Hey, what are you doing here?" you asked nonchalantly and Ryan wondered if you were mad, by asking a question like that so he gave you a look "What?" you asked but at that exact moment the person tending your wounds let you know that he was finished so he moved onto the next person after you thanked him, so Ryan came closer now talking in a softer voice "I'm here because I heard what happened and was very worried for you." he said before taking hold of your face, inspecting the cuts it held "Are you in pain?" Ryan asked and you nodded "Just a little but nothing I can't handle." you told him truthfully, so after you said that, Ryan pulled you into his arms wanting to feel you against him, knowing that you're okay. "You scared me, why weren't you answering your phone?" he asked pulling away and taking back hold of your face "I forgot it in the lab when I went to look for Steve." you replied and the moment his name left your lips you remembered "Do you what's happening with the hostage situation? Steve was one that was taken." you asked and Ryan shook his head but then he realized something and a new fear entered his thoughts "You were with him?" Ryan asked and you nodded "That means you could have been taken as well." Ryan said but more to himself while looking down at you with a hurt expression so you brought your hands up to rub his arms "Donâ€™t go there Ryan. I'm here." you told him, hoping to stop his spiral. "Let's go help those captured, okay?" you told him and he nodded before taking you back in his arms. He's just so thankful the worse didn't happen to you.

            Dave ended up coming to work to help with the hostage situation while you continued your normal work because at the end of the day, work still went on. Ryan helped out and worked with Calleigh, complying to the man's demands so he would release the hostages. One of the captees managed to get shot but she was going to be okay. Although it was a stressful situation and stressful day, everything was resolved and the work day was over.

            You and Dave were the first ones in the locker room but he left you there and at that moment a new face entered so you both greeted each other "I saw you this morning, talking to one workers that were taken." he said then out stretched a hand towards you "I'm Jessie Cardoza." you said offering you a dimple smile and you had to admit to yourself that he was really pretty to look at. You took his hand in yours "Heather Wolfe." you replied back then a look of realization over took his face "The computer tech, I heard I have to meet with you tomorrow for a one on one." he said smiling towards you so you nodded "That's me. The surface computer is pretty easy to understand." you told him and you guys talked some more about it "By any chance, do you have any connections with Ryan?" he asked looking back towards you so you smiled "Yeah, he's my husband." you told him and just that moment, Natalia, Calleigh and Ryan entered the locker room "I see you guys have met." Calleigh said entering "Yeah, he's a doll." you said smiling towards Jessie before looking back at Calleigh and she chuckled "Looks like I have some competition." Natalia said making you guys laugh "Never, you'll always be my number one." you said sending a wink her way and Jessie got curious "I thought you were with Ryan?" he asked pointing towards Ryan so he chuckled before answering "We're married, but I think they're unofficially dating." you all laughed at that "I like how he just accepts it now." Calleigh commented making you guys laugh more "So we're heading out for drinks, you tagging along Heather?" Natalia asked looking towards so you thought for a moment before shaking your head "Nah, I'm not feeling it." that caught Ryan's attention "Everything okay?" Ryan asked looking at you with concern so you nodded "Yeah, I'm just really tired. Sorry guys." you told them and they understood "That's okay, but the next time, you're coming." Natalia commented and you nodded "Definitely." you smiled towards her. You guys talked some more before leaving.

            "I'll meet you guys there." Ryan said following you and you told the others buy and to drink for you and they agreed too. "You know you didn't had to walk me right?" you told Ryan as you both made way to where you were parked "I know, but I want to." Ryan said smiling towards you which made you smile as well "Well thank you." you told him. The walk wasn't long, Ryan watched you placed your bags in the back and then opened your door for you and you stepped into place turning to him "I can ditch the guys and come home with you." Ryan said looking down at you while taking hold of your waist so you shook your head "No, go have fun." you smiled up at him "You sure?" "Positive, I'm just really tired and kind of socially drained." the moment you said that, Ryan completely understood, cause when you're like this, you usually just want a little alone time. "Okay, I understand, but don't hesitate to call if you need anything or need me to come home right away." Ryan said making you chuckled "I won't but thank you. Just go have some fun and drink with the team, you guys deserve it." you said reaching up taking hold of his cheek so he looked down at you with lovingly "Yes mam, but you will not leave me mind." he said before pecking your lips then your forehead "Do I ever leave your mind?" you said smiling up at him and he shook his head making you laugh "That's what I thought. Travel safely and I'll see you when you get home." you leaned up placing a kiss to his cheek, lingering there for a bit "I will and the same to you. Call or message when you get in and I'll try to be not out too late." you nodded "Yes sir." you guys shared a kiss before Ryan made sure you were safely in the car and he watched you drive away before going to his.

            "I am really curious about something." Jessie said alerting the others "Heather and Natalia?" Jessie continued and Ryan sighed making the rest laugh "What is this I'm missing?" Horatio asked intrigued as well so Ryan got into explaining the situation "Damn Natalia." Jessie said taking a drink from his glass and she shrugged "What can I, she's lovely and when you get to know her, you'll see it to." Natalia said and Ryan had to make a comment "No, I'm already competing with Delko and Natalia." everyone laughed at that "Also, you'll get to see how obsessed Ryan is over Heather." Natalia commented and Jessie raised his glass to that "That's not such a bad thing." so Ryan joined him "Thank you." they both drank to that. The rest of the time spent together just consisted of them joking around and catching up with each other also getting to know each other.

        <p class="story">
            The night was closed in when Ryan got home, "Baby!" Ryan called entering the apartment but he didn't hear you so he called out again "Heather." still silence, so he took off his shoes before heading for the bedroom. When entering he saw you were currently with headphones on and dancing to whatever was playing in them. Your back was currently turned, so you didn't see when Ryan entered. He was currently leaning against the door frame hypnotized by your dancing body, just watching you. As you were turning you caught sight of him and that startled you a little and Ryan chuckled and pulled off your headphones "Don't stop on my account." he said pushing himself off the frame so you disconnected your headphones so the music played out loud and you held out your hand towards him, which he took hold of bringing your bodies closer together before wrapping his arms around your waist to dance with you. Your bodies swayed as you danced together to Mama by Jonas Blue. You brought your hands up to grab his shoulders "You're getting it." you said smiling encouraging him more "Maybe because I had a little too much to drink." Ryan commented "Hopefully not too much that it seems like I took advantage of you." you said starting to feel up his chest as you moved your hips more and Ryan smirked down at you with a shake of his head "You could never so don't worry about it." he said bringing his hands down to grip your hips. "Maybe I gotta fill you with drinks more often to make you dance like this." you said before placing kisses in his neck "I won't complain, it stops my mind from over thinking." he said in a hum enjoying your kisses. You eventually moved out of his neck and that made Ryan groan cause you stopped but you only did that to kiss up his jawline going to the corner of his mouth "Sober enough to handle me?" you asked him as your lips hovered over his and that resulted in him to lean forward to take hold of the back of your thighs to lift you up, wrapping your legs around his torso "I'm more than capable." he said with a smirk before attaching his lips to yours.
