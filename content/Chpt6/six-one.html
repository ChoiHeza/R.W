            Ryan waited at the hospital til you got there "Hey." you both greeted each other with a hug "How's he doing?" you asked Ryan hopeful and he explained it's not good "But they're asking for blood, and I know you have problem with needles so I don't know if you would wan-" you cut of Ryan "Of course I would, it's for Eric." you told Ryan but he still looked at you with concern "Are you sure?" Ryan asked so you nodded "Just, hold my hand through the process." you told him and he smiled down at you "Of course." with that he led you away to get the blood taken.

            "Afraid of needles?" the nurse asked as she was disinfecting the part of your skin where the needle was going to be injected "Terrified." you said with a chuckle causing her to chuckle as well "That's completely normal." she said then turned to get the needle so you turned towards Ryan to look at him "Just hold my hand, and keep your eyes on me." Ryan said giving your hand a squeeze and when he saw the nurse was about to start he gave you a nod "So how did you two meet?" the nurse asked to keep you distracted so you told her the story earning some laughs from her "So the real hero here is the spider?" she asked just as she pulled the needle out "Spiders, plural." you chuckled and Ryan just kept smiling at you "Okay, all finished." the moment those words left her lips you released a huge breath and looked towards her "Thank you." you said offering her a smile "No, thank you." she said gesturing to your blood.

            Ryan had to get back to work, so you decided to stay with Calleigh and just be there for here. "You it's funny to think that you were in this position before." Calleigh said as she squeezed your hand "What do you mean?" you asked unsure of what she meant "When I was in the hospital, you were the one here with him." she said offering you a grateful look and you smiled "Well, where else would I be." you told her truthfully "We all care for Eric a great deal, some more than others." you said with a wink at the end and she chuckled. Just that moment Alexx approached you two and gave an update on how Eric is doing. She let us know it's going to take time before he wakes up and then they can go from there. You just continued to hold Calleigh in your arms while she cried and told her to not lose hope.

            It was the evening now when everyone was at the hospital and you all were piled in Eric's room just waiting and hoping he wakes up. Ryan currently had held against his side with your head resting on his chest eyes closed saying a silent pray for Eric. You suddenly felt Ryan squeezed your waist making you open your eyes and what you saw was an amazing sight. Eric was finally awake and you all just felt a sense of relief knowing that he's going to be okay.

            "Want to reschedule tonight for tomorrow?" Ryan asked as you both took off your shoes. "What was tonight?" you asked completely lost and Ryan chuckled "I made reservations for tonight." then the look of realization overtook your face "I completely forgot about that, but yeah, tomorrow." you told him taking your bag and heading for the kitchen. "Okay, I'll call and change it." Ryan said following you while taking out his phone. When you got to the kitchen you rest down your bag and went to the take out menu drawer cause you're too tired to cook tonight. "What do you feel like eating?" you asked Ryan taking out the menus "Pizza!" Ryan said way to quickly making you laugh "Okay, pizza it is." you said getting the menu before placing the order and the same time Ryan changed the reservation. Since the pizza is going to take a while before it got there, you guys decided to shower.

            While you were in the bedroom getting dressed you heard the doorbell "That should be pizza, I'll get it." Ryan said as he quickly tossed on a shirt before getting up from the bed leaving. Ryan greeted the guy and paid with tip before placing the pizza on the island counter. "That smells amazing." you said entering the kitchen making Ryan chuckle "I guess because it's been so long since we've had any." you agreed and wasted no time in sitting and watched as Ryan unboxed it.

            "What do you think is going to happen with Eric?" you asked as you both were still eating "What do you mean?" Ryan asked looking towards you "The fact that helped out his father run from the police, would he be arrested?" you asked curious and Ryan shook his head "I doubt he would be arrested but there will be consequences to his actions." Ryan said and you nodded "Hopefully he doesn't get in too much trouble." "I think he will be okay." Ryan reassured "But it will be a while before he returns back to work." you nodded understanding and you guys talked some more about the situation.

            You both were currently in the bathroom brushing your teeth getting ready for bed "Have I told you that I loved you today?" Ryan asked looking towards you in the mirror making you look back with a smile "I think you did, this morning, before we left for work." and Ryan shook his head before spitting out "That's not good enough. I've been slacking." Ryan said making you chuckle "It was an event filled kind of day, so that's okay. Plus I already know that you do, like for example this evening when I was getting my blood drawn, you told me you loved me without telling me you loved me." you said making Ryan give you a puzzled look "What do you mean?" so you held up your finger to tell Ryan hold on as you washed out your mouth before replying. "When you kept me company while I was getting my blood taken. You held my hand, told me to keep my eyes on you and engaged me in conversation with the nurse. That right there was an action of love. Another example, you came to see me off before I left for the office." you said turning to him fully now "You don't have to constantly tell me that you love me because your actions lets me know." you said giving him a smile and he looked towards you with a look of love "Even that." you said pointing at his face "What, me brushing my teeth?" Ryan asked before going to wash out his mouth "No, the look you gave me just now, a 'I love you' look." Ryan stood back up fully now facing you "You can read that?" Ryan asked smiling down at you and you nodded "I can, cause your eyes get all cute and soft." you said taking hold of his face and he did the look again "Yes, that's it!" you said grinning widely "I love you." Ryan said out loud this time instead of inside his head and your features softened at that "And I love you." you replied back and Ryan smiled "I guess that's your 'I love you' look" and you chuckled "I bet I looked pathetic." and Ryan chuckled "Very pathetic." Ryan joked making you release his face and smack his chest "I take back my love." you said walking away from Ryan making him laugh "Babe, I was joking." Ryan said approaching and halting your steps by hugging you from behind "You actually looked really adorable. Like I could shower you in an infinite amount of kisses adorable." Ryan said truthfully resting his face in the crook of your neck. "Now you're just saying that." you said making Ryan shake his head "No. I mean it." he said while against your skin making you giggle cause he was tickling you "Stop, you're tickling me." you said and that only encouraged him to tickle you more making you have a full on laughing fit. Ryan only stopped when he figured you've had enough. "Still with me babe?" Ryan asked as you came down from your laughing and you nodded "But I could of easily died." you said as you both made your way to the bedroom and Ryan rolled his eyes "Oh please." Ryan said chuckling and you shrugged your shoulders "It's true." you said heading over to the dresser as Ryan plopped down on the bed "Please do tell me how that would have been possible." he said watching you as you walked around the bed to your side before dropping down onto it next to him "While laughing, my lungs wouldn't have been getting enough air." you tried your best to tell him with a straight face "Now that would definitely be a dramatic way to go." Ryan said making you sit up to lightly beat him "You are so mean tonight." you said and Ryan took hold of yours hands stopping the assault "Says the woman that is currently abusing me." "And you say I'm the dramatic one." you said looking down at him and all Ryan could do was smile up at you "You truly are beautiful." Ryan said almost mesmerized by you and before you had a chance to say anything, Ryan brought you down to place a passionate kiss on your lips and taking his time just letting you know that he loves you.
