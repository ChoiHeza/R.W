            You were the first to wake up, so you were currently just watching Ryan as he slept and a smile couldn't help but grace your face as you looked over his features. He just looked so adorable and more than usual because he was putting on some weight and it was getting more noticeable as the days went by and this was a look of his that you were enjoying. Not being able to help yourself anymore, you brought your hand up and started lightly tracing the features of his face being careful to not wake him up. This went on for a good while and little did you know that Ryan was already awake, but just enjoying the feeling of your fingers. It came to a point when he couldn't hold back anymore, so a smile appeared on his face as he said "If I didn’t know any better, I would say that you're obsessed with me." his statement surprised you then brought a smile to your face "How long have you been awake?" you asked and he opened his eyes to meet yours "Long enough to feel when you first touched my face." he said smiling wider now, so you leaned forward and gave him a kiss "Good morning." you said as you pulled back "Good morning, slept well?" Ryan asked bringing his hand up to capture your waist, pulling you closer towards him "Like a baby." you said continuing your trace along his face "You?" "Perfect." Ryan said grinning and just as he was about to pull you in for another kiss, his phone rang making him groan. You just chuckled at his reaction as you watched him. He got called out to work earlier than usual because of an incident that occurred at the beach.

            Ryan was in the locker room when you and Calleigh entered. "Mom and daughter dating the same guy, that's highly disturbing." you commented as Calleigh was telling you some details of the case "Hey guys." Ryan greeted as he saw you both, he was in front his locker taking off his jacket. You both greeted back and continued talking about the case as you went to your respective lockers. Calleigh asked Ryan if he think the daughter did it "Uh, she's got motive and there's nobody to back up her alibi. What about you, did you guys find anything?" Ryan asked her and when she turned to reply, someone caught her attention making her go quiet, so both you and Ryan looked towards her then followed her line of sight. It was Eric. When seeing him, both you and Ryan broke out into smiles and greeted him, Ryan with a shake and you with a hug. After you guys talked for a bit, he went to his locker and both you and Ryan watched how quiet Calleigh and Eric were towards each other, that resulted in you and Ryan sharing a look. Your eyes asked him 'What's that about?' and he shrugged, before you both turned back to your lockers. As Eric passed back, he bid you both a bye before leaving, not once talking to Calleigh. When it was just you three again, you were the first one to speak "I'm sorry, but I gotta ask, what was that about, the no talking?" you asked turning to her and Ryan joined cause he was curious as well "We're not allowed to speak. No contact until the investigation is closed." she said with a small smile and a distant look in her eyes. Ryan sighed before asking "And why is that?" "Well, the interviews are today, so hopefully the nightmare will be over and Eric will be able to come back to work." Calleigh said with hope "Or you could both lose your jobs." Ryan said and the moment those words left his mouth, you smacked him across the chest with the back of your hand "Ryan!" you said giving him a look and he was like 'What?' "That's not very positive." Calleigh said before leaving and you turned to him "Really? You just had to say that." you shook your head turning back to your locker "Well, I didn't mean it that way." and you gave him one more look as you closed your locker, then you just shook your head starting to walk away "Was that bad?" he asked out to you and you nodded "Yes, very." you said before you were completely out the room.

            You were in your lab working on a different case when two voices entered, one of them you weren't expecting to hear "Is that Walter Simmons I'm hearing?" you said turning around with a huge smile on your face and his surprised expression matched yours returning your grin "Heather!" "What are you doing awake?" you asked making him laugh "I got transferred to the day shift." he said with a huge grin "I love the sound of that." you approached each other and did your special handshake and Jessie just stood there watching on, with a smile on his lips "I take it you guys are close." he stated with a chuckle making you both nod "When Heather had to stay back and work nights, either from teaching us the program or helping out, we hung out a lot, cause there was a lot of free time." Walter said and you chuckled at the memory "Those were some amazing nights." you both shared a laugh "You'll like him dimples." you told Jessie referring to Walter "Dimples?" Walter asked with a smile while looking towards Jessie and he shrugged "It kind of stuck, I like it." you all shared a smile and a few more laughs before turning back to work.

            As you were at the other computer working, you heard Walter and Jessie talking about cougars "How you know about that?" Jessie asked surprise and Walter gave his explanation making you laugh, and they both looked towards you "Walter, you're fooling no one." you said then pointed a finger at him "Got to keep an eye on him." you said making Jessie laugh and Walter released a gasp acting like he was hurt "Wolfe, how could you do me like this?" he said with a hand on his chest and you just shrugged "Just speaking facts Simmons."

            You and Ryan were in the locker room, gathering your things getting ready to leave. "I can't believe you didn’t know what a cougar was." you joked towards Ryan and he sighed "Natalia?" he asked as in who told you and you nodded "I knew it was a thing, just didn't know they were terms for it." Ryan stated "It's okay. Would you be a cub?" you asked Ryan and the look he gave you made you laugh "I take that as a no…." you said coming down from your laugh and at the same time Natalia entered the locker room "What’s funny?" she asked going to her locker "I asked Ryan if he would be a cub and the look he gave me." you told her trying to recreate the look and that made you break out in laughter again along with Natalia this time. "That was clearly a no. So what about you Heather, would you date an older guy?" Natalia asked and you thought hard on it "Depends on the guy, but yeah, I could see myself dating an older guy." you said truthfully and that made Natalia look at you amazed "Really?!" she and Ryan asked the same time and you nodded chuckling "What?" you asked so Ryan waved his hands before asking "So when you said you love Tom Cruise, you meant like 'love' Tom Cruise, as in you would actually date the guy?" Ryan asked trying to understand and you nodded with a small laugh "He's beautiful." you said with a shrug "Huh." Ryan said finding this very interesting "I could see it. I see what you mean Heather." Natalia said and you both high fived at that leaving Ryan in shock. "You won't leave me for an older guy right?" Ryan asked looking towards you and you shook your head "No baby, I'm afraid you're stuck with me."

            You both were on the sofa watching tv, feet in Ryan's lap as he massaged your calves. Suddenly a question crossed Ryan's mind that he wanted to ask you earlier. "Hey babe, question." he started so you hummed looking towards him "When we're together, why have you never bitten me?" Ryan asked seriously leaving you completely confused "I'm lost." the look of confusion on your face made Ryan chuckle "I mean like when we're making out or having sex." he said then realization crossed your face before you smile towards him "Ah, like that. Well, for starters you bruise like a peach baby. Plus I didn't think that would be something you would like." you told him truthfully and he chuckled "I do bruise easily but I don't dislike the idea." Ryan said and you raised your brow at that "Really?" you asked starting to slowly move towards Ryan and he nodded "Interesting." you said sitting on his lap now and he looked at you "Want to  test the theory?" you asked smirking down at him and his hands captured your hips "We could." he said smiling, which you returned before placing your lips on his.
