            You were awoken when you felt kisses being placed on your body. "What time is it?" you asked still sleep induced "Still very early." Ryan said not stopping what he was doing. "And why are you up early?" you asked peeping open your eyes, so Ryan stopped placing kisses on your stomach and looked up at you giving a shrug "Just instincts." Ryan said but you didn't buy it "Ryan, this is earlier than usual." you said with slit eyes and Ryan smiled "I may or may not had a certain dream that woke me up wanting you." he said shyly bringing his face up to yours and you just shook your head "And you had to wake me for that?" you asked turning to face him and he nodded "Of course." he said gripping your hip, pulling your body against his "Now what if I said no." you asked teasingly "Well, then I would have to convince you." he said before rolling you both over so he could hover over you "And you're confident in your ability to do so?" you asked smirking up at him and he nodded with a chuckle "Of course." with that he moved towards your neck to place kisses there, making you move your head to give him more access "See, it's working." Ryan said based on your actions so to indulge him more, you brought your legs up to wrap around his hips, pulling down his body closer to yours "I guess you know my weakness." you said and he pulled away to look down at you "If I didn't, that would make me an awful husband." Ryan commented moving his left hand to grip your thigh. You gripped his neck pulling his lips towards yours "It's a good thing you know your stuff." you smirked before pulling him closer to connect your lips together. Just as Ryan was deepening the kiss, his phone rang making him release a heavy groan. "Ignore it." you said keeping your limbs wrapped around him and he listened to you and ignored it for just a second but it wouldn't stop ringing so he knew it had to be work. Not moving from your body, he reached his hand across for his phone before answering. "This is Wolfe." you watched as Ryan answered the phone and you immediately saw his face fell "I'll be there." with that he hung up his phone, tossing it on the bed before allowing his body to crash on yours, face going to your neck. "Work?" you asked and Ryan answered with a groan "But it's still really early." you questioned looking at the clock and Ryan sighed leaning up "Exactly, it's like they sensed that I woke up early just to have a nice time with my wife." Ryan said annoyed starting to get up but you kept him trapped "Do you really have to go?" you asked with a pout and Ryan's heart caved, because he wanted nothing more than to just stay here with you "Yes baby. It's a guy on death row and we have twenty-four hours to prove he's guilty." your heart caved as well because he really had to leave and with cases like these, every minute counts. "Fine." you sighed so Ryan leaned down against your lips "I'm so sorry." he said before giving you a sweet kiss "It's okay." you reassured and you shared one more kiss before you untangled yourself from Ryan allowing him to leave, so he could get ready for work.

            It didn’t take Ryan long to get ready, but you remained in bed the whole time, watching him as he moved to and fro. "Look good?" Ryan asked turning to you "Handsome as always" you compliment with a smile so Ryan came over to the bed to meet you "Okay babe, I have to go." you were on your knees at the edge for the bed, and Ryan took hold of your waist "Okay, be careful and be safe please." you said capturing his face, looking into his eyes "Always beautiful. And have a good day at the office, I'll see you this evening." you nodded before pulling him in for a goodbye kiss "I love you." he returned your smile and a kiss of his own "And I love you." he smiled down at you before kissing your forehead, and like that he was gone.

            The day went by pretty quickly for you, and before you know it, you told everyone bye, you left the office and made your way home. Since you would be getting home after Ryan you decided to stop and buy some take out before heading in. "Hello hello." you greeted as you came through the apartment door. "Hey babe." you heard Ryan's voice from the living room, so you took off your shoes and rested the take out in the kitchen before making your way towards Ryan. "Hey." you said as you entered the living seeing Ryan on the sofa watching tv. He turned away to look at you "Hey babe." he said with a smile as you sat down next to him. You guys shared a kiss in greeting. "I brought home food." you said making Ryan chuckle "And I brought home food as well." you laughed at that "We need to start letting each other know when we buy food." you suggested and Ryan nodded "Had a good day?" Ryan asked pulling you closer into his side, so you rested your head on his shoulder "It was quick, so much meetings but I couldn't wait to come home to spend the rest of my day from my husband, because he was taken from me this morning." you said pulling him closer "And yours?" you asked leaning up so you could take off your button up shirt to reveal the vest under. "Busy, but we definitely proved that he was guilty." that made you smile "Nice." instead of leaning back to lay on Ryan, you moved to straddle his lap and his hands instantly took purchase on your hips "What's up?" he asked looking up at you as you smiled down at him "Well, we were disturbed this morning and I was bummed out by that." you said making Ryan's grip tightened "Imagine how I felt. I'm the one that had the dream." Ryan said making you chuckle "So, shall we indulge in this dream of yours Mr. Wolfe." you asked moving to place kisses in his neck, the action caused him to pull you closer by your hips before moving them to your behind. "I will not say no to that." that made you smile kissing up to his lips before connecting them with his. Just when you were about to deepen the kiss, you heard your phone ring, and watch vibrate. You were going to ignore it but it wouldn't stop and it felt like a sense of deja vu from this morning. "Hold on." you said making Ryan groan so you could check your watch to see who it was. "It's the lab." you told him with a sigh "I gotta take this." you said quickly reaching for your phone and answered it, not moving from Ryan's lap. Ryan watched you on the phone, as his hands massaged your thighs. "Okay, I'll be there." you said before hanging up and sighed "What happened?" "One of the surface computers stopped working, so they're switching it and I gotta upload the new software." you said starting to get up "I'm starting to think that the department doesn't like us having fun." Ryan commented making you chuckle "They may have cameras here." you suggested with a raised brow, before heading to the bedroom "I would not be surprised by that, by the amount of times we get disturbed with work just when we're about to have sex." Ryan said following after you "Major sigh babe." you said entering the bedroom going over to the closet "Changing your clothes?" Ryan asked and you shook your head "Only the shirt, I just want to quickly leave and return." you told him looking for a fresh shirt "Want me give you a ride?" Ryan asked as you turned back to him "Nah, cause then you'll have to come back for me, plus you've had a long day so I wouldn’t want to bother you." you said truthfully "You know I don't mind right?" you nodded "I know but, I'm good, I promise." you said taking hold of Ryan's face "Sure sure?" he asked "Sure sure." you replied with a smile before pecking his lips "I gotta go, so I'll see you when I come back in." Ryan nodded before giving you a goodbye kiss "Be safe." "Always." with that you were out the door.
