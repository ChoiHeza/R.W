            "Don't you look cute." you said exiting the bathroom, seeing Ryan now dressed in his shirt. "Sarcasm?" Ryan asked turning to you  "Of course not babe. You look very adorable." you complimented coming over to him "Hopefully not too adorable, because then how am I supposed to intimidate the suspects." Ryan said as you captured his face "You, intimidating?" you asked with a raised brow after kissing his cheek and moving away to finished get dressed yourself "You should see me in the interrogation room." you thought for a moment "You know, I don't think I've ever seen you interrogate someone before." you said then turned to him before continuing "I bet you look quit smug." you chuckled and Ryan shrugged "Maybe, it's hard not to be smug, knowing you're the in charge in the situation." you rolled your eyes "Of course you would say something like that." "But you love me being smug." Ryan said as you both meet eyes "Sadly a bit." you confessed and Ryan grinned making you shake your head at him.

            Calleigh, Jessie and Ryan arrived at the victim's house, to search for any clues that may lead to her killer "Wow! I should have been an assistant." Ryan commented as he looked at the victim's house just as they arrived "There's no way she got a house this good from making thirty thousand a year." Jessie inputted "Hopefully we can find the answers inside." Ryan was still hung up on house amazing the house looked "This house is really gorgeous. I would live here." Ryan said still admiring the exterior of the house "Maybe you should find out if it'll be back on the market and buy it." Jessie suggested and that made Ryan laugh "Not with the kind of money I make, no way, but Heather definitely could close her eyes and buy this." Ryan said making the others look towards him "She makes more than you?" Jessie asked and Ryan nodded "Way more." "I could see that, she is like crazy smart after all." Calleigh stated and Ryan nodded "Anyways, enough about things I can't have, let's get to work." Ryan said making the others laugh at him.

            "Hey hey." Calleigh announced as she entered the lab "Hey Cal. What brings you by?" you asked turning to her "Records." she started as she stood next to you then continued about what she wanted. As you were searching she turned towards you "We visited the victim's house today, and I think Ryan fell in love." Calleigh said making you give her a quick glance "Yeah?" you asked and she nodded "I think if it was available, he would of bought it then and there." you chuckled "I guess that's something we could discuss, looking for a house." "Never had the conversation before?" she asked and you shook your head "Not really, I just assumed Ryan preferred living in an apartment but I'll ask him what he thinks." you said and just then the computer dinged letting you both know the search was completed.

            "Sure you don't want to hang around at work with us?" Walter asked and you, him and Ryan headed for the elevator. "Nah, I have to stop by the office then get home and cook." you told him "Sucks you're married." Walter commented catching Ryan's attention "Hey! She chooses to cook." Ryan said and that made you look towards him giving him a stare "You're right, maybe I should stop." you said with a raised brow and Ryan sighed "Now look at what you've done Walter, she's going to poison my dish later." Ryan said making both you and Walter chuckle "Who knows." you said with a shrug. As you guys reached the elevator Frank and Jessie were there waiting for it as well, you all greeted each other "Heading off or staying back short stuff?" Jessie asked looking down at you "Heading off, got to head to the office." you replied and just that moment the elevator opened "Short stuff?" Frank questioned between you two curious "She calls me dimples so I call her short stuff." Jessie said as you all piled into the elevator. "Makes sense." Frank commented. Just as the doors were about to close, the lights flickered making everyone look up and they all shared a look "You know what, I'll take the stairs." Walter said first, and Frank agreed with him following after. "You know what, that's not such a bad idea." Jessie said before leaving as well. Then Ryan looked up once more before reaching for you hand and pulling you out the elevator along with him "Stairs it is." he said heading in the direction of them "I'm so confused, what's going on?" you asked confusion written all over your face "Don't worry your pretty little head about it." Ryan said as he lead you to the stairs, so you just shrugged and followed him.

            You were in bed first while Ryan was in the bathroom brushing his teeth, just waiting for him to come out to discuss something with him. "Ready to sleep?" you heard Ryan asked as he exited the bathroom turning off the light "Not as yet, there was something I wanted to talk to you about." Ryan made his way to the bed before sitting on his side "Sure, what is it?" he asked looking at you intently "Calleigh told me about the house today, that you fell in love with." you said making Ryan chuckle at the memory "It really was beautiful. Was it something about the house that you wanted to talk about?" "Not that house in general but our house." you said losing Ryan "You lost me." Ryan said and you chuckled before turning towards him in a legs crossed position "When Calleigh mentioned that to me today, it made me thinking of us owning our own house, or at least if owning a house is something you want." you queried and Ryan smiled "Of course. You know what was something I pictured when I saw that house today, I saw us living a nice house like that one, with our children." Ryan said truthfully making your heart go soft along with your features "Really?" you asked him going closer and he nodded "Really, we aren't getting any younger, it would be nice to start saving up to buy a house, so by next year or two we'll be living in our own house, with maybe a baby on the way, but that's only if you want to." the smile on your face could not stop growing from hearing Ryan words "Of course I would want to, but I think we should get the house out the way before a baby maybe, now what if we end up with twins or triplets on our first try." you said and Ryan chuckled agreeing. "I agree, so are we really going to do this?" Ryan asked taking your hands in his and you nodded "I think we're ready, to be grown-ups grown-ups." you said making Ryan chuckle "That's a nice way of putting it. The moment my major depts are paid off, which should be soon, we could get started on the house." Ryan suggested and you nodded "That sounds perfect." you released his hands and brought them up to his face "I love you Ryan." you said being thankful to be living this life with him "And I love you Heather." and Ryan couldn't picture living his life with anyone else.
