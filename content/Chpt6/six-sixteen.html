            "I realized you've been hitting the gym." you told Ryan as you watched him put on his shirt "Yeah, I got tired not being able to hold you close to me because of my stomach, especially when I tried to lift you up." Ryan said truthfully looking towards you, so you gave him a sulk "You realized that?" you asked and Ryan nodded coming over to you "It was hard not to but I was hoping you didn’t catch on when I stopped lifting you up." you smiled closing the distance you two "I did notice it but I didn't mind it because I was a big fan of your big tummy." you said tapping his receding stomach and Ryan raised a brow at that "You have a thing for big guys?" he asked and you chuckled "I have a thing for whatever my husband looks like. You could be a ball, which you almost looked like for a moment and I loved every bit of it." you told him truthfully, wrapping your arms around his waist so he smiled down at you "As much as I loved the affection I received during that time, I prefer to be smaller for you." Ryan said capturing your hands and bringing them to wrap around his neck while he held your waist, keeping you close against him. You titled your head curious about why he said that "Why, do you prefer to be smaller for me?" "Well, I love holding you close to me like this. I felt like I couldn't be my usual self with you, like when we play fight, or when I just throw my body to lay on top of you, because if I did that, I would of crushed you baby. Yeah I'm not the biggest guy but you're smaller than me and that wouldn't have right." you were about to protest and Ryan knew it, so he pecked your lips shushing you before continuing "I know you're going to say you'll love me no matter what and that none of that bothers you but it bothered me, because I want to be able to comfortably lift up my wife and let her wrap her legs around my hips while I make her feel good." Ryan said with a knowing smile at the end, making you blush "Leave it to you to make it sexual." you said with a smile and roll of your eyes "But it's not all sexual, it also helps with chasing perps better, cause in case you didn’t know, I do that a lot. You know they always run first." Ryan said making laugh "Okay okay." that made him smile "But it is nice to know, that you would love me no matter what." Ryan said making you grin "Of course, I've been true many of your phases and I loved every single one of them." you said truthfully, before tiptoeing to give him a kiss "I wish I could say the same about you." Ryan said making you pull away, to give him a look "Excuse me." you said taken back but Ryan just kept his smile on his face "I wish I could say the same about loving you through all your phases, because to me you've had one phase, you have not changed from when we've met, you're still the same beautiful woman I met that day, if not even more beautiful." that made you full on blush "Ryan!" you whined removing your hands from his neck to hide your face and Ryan laughed "But it's true babe." your insides were hurting at how sweet that was "I can feel myself getting cavities." you said peeping up at him from your hands and Ryan just kept laughing "I can't believe you're still so shy about this, we've been together for eight years now, but it's cute." Ryan said pulling your hands away so he could place kisses all over your face making you giggle. Because of how cute Ryan found you in that moment, it almost made you guys late for work.

            "Some people deserves to rot in hell." Ryan said as he entered your lab, so you quickly looked around towards him at his statement "Whoa, pissed you off?" you asked concerned as he came next to you, and you could see the annoyance in his face "One of the suspects, I just know it's him that raped that woman and killed the other." you sighed before looking towards him "Okay, but what's him different?" you asked and Ryan looked down at you confused "What do you mean?" "You encounter guys like him regularly, but you don't get this pressed, so it's got to be something else." Ryan hated that you knew him so well, so he contemplated if to tell you the real reason because it was so stupid, so he calmed down with a sigh "You know you can talk to me." he thought some more before caving "It is something else." he started so you gestured for him to continue "The guy commented on my height, like calling me names based on my height." Ryan said finally looking back at you "But why, you're tall." you said Ryan gave you a look "That's only because you're shorter me. Did you know I'm the shortest guy on the team?" you were trying to understand "And this bothers you?" you asked "Not really know, but a scumbag like him making those comments annoys me." Ryan said speaking his mind and you nodded "Well, he's a scumbag for a reason babe, and nothing is wrong with your height." you reassured him smiling up at him "You're just saying that because you're my wife." Ryan said with a sigh making you roll your eyes "Fine, let that jerk get in your head." you said turning back to the computer. Ryan was about to say something but he got a message that he was needed elsewhere "Ryan, nothing is wrong with you and he's a jerk, don't let it get to you." you said before he moved to leave "Thanks babe." Ryan said giving you a smile and a tap to your lower back before he left.

            Calleigh and Walter were with you currently in the lab, because they brought a device for you to check out, it truly looked pretty familiar but you couldn't place it so you just pushed that aside for now "You're looking at a soviet made laser microwave beam disbursal unit." you said looking at the screen "Great… but this time in English." Walter said not understanding a thing you just said "A transmitter, for a wireless microphone." you clarified "It's a very tricked out bug." you added "So I was right, someone had ears on that murder." Walter told you "Is there anywhere of finding out where the signal is transmitting?" Calleigh asked looking towards you "Well, as high tech as it maybe, it should be able to be tracked like a normal cell transmission." you said starting the search "Triangulating the satellites, it's scoping down." then it revealed it's destination and all your faces entered confusion "Got a hit, but it's here" the moment those words left your mouth Calleigh and Walter looked at you and realization hit you "Am I going crazy or is the receiver in the parking garage." Walter questioned looking back at the screen "No, you're not crazy." you and Calleigh said that at the same time making you both look at each other "You know something?" Calleigh asked you "I'm not sure, but when you brought in the device, I knew it looked familiar but after running the search, my suspicions are confirmed." you said wondering if to say anything more "It's okay Heather, tell me what you know." you sighed before continuing "A few weeks ago Jessie asked me to help him program a listening device, and I was skeptical at first but he said it was nothing harmless." you said and Calleigh nodded "So we're thinking the same person." she said then gave you a smile "Thanks Heather, I'm going to go and check it out." she told you before turning to leave "Need me to come with you?" Walter asked "No, I got this." she said leaving you guys. Then you and Walter looked towards each other "You think I'm in trouble?" you asked concerned and Walter shook his head "Nah, you didn't do anything wrong." Walter reassured so you nodded hoping also that Jessie would be okay.

            Frank gave you a call to check out something for him, so after getting the info he needed you uploaded it to your tablet and headed his direction. You just passed the interrogation rooms and a man cuffed was heading your way along with Calleigh and Ryan following behind. You smiled when you saw Ryan, but the cuffed man figured that was directed towards him "Hey gorgeous." he said pulling your attention away from Ryan and you recognized it was one the suspects and you just had a feeling it was the guy that was giving Ryan hell, so you decided to play along "Hey, I recognize you." you said with a smile which caused him to smirk "You've probably seen me play pro ball." he said clearly trying to impress you "Nah, I don’t think that's it." you said then entered a state of thought before recognition crossed your face "Ah I remember, you were the gum I scraped off my shoe this morning." you said with the sweetest smile you could muster before leaving him there fuming heading towards Ryan and Calleigh, and the look on their face showed that they heard the interaction that went on "That was not very nice." Calleigh commented with a grin and you shrugged "He was a jerk towards Ryan." you said and Ryan smiled "How did you know it was him?" Ryan asked "He looked like the type." you said and Ryan was truly impressed "And this is why I love you." he said raising his hand which you connected in a high five. "Anytime babe. Later." you said before leaving them going over to Frank, leaving them both impressed by you.

            "What you did today was amazing." Ryan said taking hold of your waist, the moment your shoes were off and his jacket was discarded "Got to be more specific babe, because everything I do is amazing." you said with a chuckle making Ryan grin down at you "That is true, but I was referring to the guy you told off, I would have been worried if he wasn't going away for a very very very long time, but since he is, I can enjoy it." Ryan said making you laugh "It felt really nice." you said with a contented sigh "I could imagine, and it was so satisfying to see." Ryan said wrapping his arms tighter around your waist now "Well, no one messes with what's mine." you said with a proud smile and Ryan loved hearing those words leave your lips "Now that's hot." so you winked before leaning up to leave a kiss on his lips. "Where are you going?" Ryan asked as you started to move out his hold, "The kitchen." you replied and Ryan shook his head "No you're not." he said taking back hold of your body "I'm not?" you asked teasingly "Nope, you're coming to the bedroom with me." Ryan said playing along, smiling down at you "Jump." he signaled and you did just that, legs going perfectly around his waist, well almost "Would you look at that." Ryan commented on it making you chuckle "Just shut up and kiss me." you said gripping his neck and Ryan doesn't need to be told twice, because in an instant his lips were on yours.
