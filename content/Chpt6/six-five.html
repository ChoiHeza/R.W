            "Have I told you that I love the look?" you commented towards Ryan as he was backing you facing the dresser "The button up and jeans combo?" Ryan asked turning slightly to look at you and you shook your head "No, the you being chubby look." you said making your way over to him now "Yeah?" he asked and you nodded smiling widely "You look very adorable." you told him truthfully taking hold of his face and that made him smile from ear to ear "Well, I'm not the one responsible for this." you gave him a fake offended look "And I am?" you asked and he nodded "I did tell you at the beginning of this relationship, that you're going to make me fat one of these days, because your cooking is amazing and you've picked up a new hobby of baking." Ryan said but you poked his stomach "That doesn't mean you have to eat it all." Ryan sighed "That's very hard to do when everything you make tastes so good." that compliment made you all happy inside "Thank you, I guess for being my personal eater." you chuckled and Ryan did as well "Always. By the way, don't forget that I made dinner reservations for tonight." Ryan said wrapping his arms around your waist "I haven't forgotten." you said smiling up at him before tiptoeing a planting a kiss on his lips, which was getting a bit more difficult to do because of Ryan's growing tummy, but you won't tell him that, and hopefully he doesn't notice.

            You were currently in your lab working in between different cases when you heard Ryan knock on your glass before entering "Hey babe." he greeted, making his way over to you "What brings you by?" Ryan was stood next to you now and tilted his head "Heard about the couple from the case I'm working on?" Ryan asked and you nodded "Yeah, I did. Need information on something?" you asked looked towards him "Nah, I just came to run something by you." "Okay, what is it?" "Would it be okay if we cancel our reservations, I'm not feeling it anymore." Ryan said making you worry "Why, what's wrong?" you asked turning your body fully towards him now. He explained how what happened with the couple and how they got sick so you immediately understood why Ryan cancelled the dinner "I completely understand because after hearing that, I don't think I'll be able to eat out for a while." you said going into thought and Ryan nodded "That's scary." you commented and Ryan agreed "We could always do something else instead." Ryan suggested "Yeah, we could discuss that after work." "Thanks babe, and I'm sorry for cancelling." you shook your head "No need to apologize for that." you told him truthfully and he gave you a smile "See you later?" you nodded "Of course." with that you both shared a smile as Ryan tapped you on your lower back before he left.

            You just came from the bathroom and decided to stop by in the locker room for something, so upon entering you saw Eric there. "Hey!" you greeted making him look towards you with a smile "Hey Heads, been a while." Eric said as you made your way towards him forgetting your locker, and the moment you were in front each other, he pulled you into a hug "How has it been?" you asked him pulling away and he told you how he was doing, but while he was talking to sensed something "I guess it's good to be back." he said separately at the end making you tilt your head to the side "I don't buy it. You weren't planning on coming back weren't you?" you asked seriously and he gave you a look that answered your question without him having to say a word so you nodded "Don't worry, I won't say anything, and I understand." you told him taking hold of his arm "Thank you Heather." he said smiling towards you, which you returned "Always. You know I'm here whenever you need someone to talk to." "I know, and I'm really thankful for that." you guys talked a bit more before going back to work.

            At the end of your shift, in the locker room now were you, Ryan, Natalia, Calleigh, Jessie and Walter. "We girls can go to the community garden while you guys head to the fields." Natalia said as you guys decided where to go to help out "Why, because we're men?" Walter asked with a light heartedness in his voice "Well, yes and no." Calleigh commented "Well, I think it's a good idea." Ryan said agreeing with Natalia "Thank you Ryan." "Hm, I wonder why." Jessie commented towards Ryan "Secretly, I think we all know why." Calleigh said making everyone hum in unison except you and Ryan "I'm sorry, is there something I'm missing?" you asked completely lost "It's nothing babe, don't worry about it." Ryan said but you know it was more, so you decided to ask the girls when you're at the garden.

            "Okay, Natalia and Calleigh, spill." you asked as you three were sitting taking a break "Spill what?" Natalia asked taking a sip from here water "I think she means what happened in the locker room." Calleigh said and you nodded "Yes that, what was it?" you asked hoping they clear up your confusion, and they both released a small laugh "Ryan only agreed because we all know he wouldn't want you working in the field in the sun." you scoffed at what Natalia just said "That's ridiculous." Calleigh tilted her head towards you "Is it really?" she asked and you thought for a moment "Okay maybe not but that's not fair. What if I wanted to work in the field?" you asked and they both gave you a look "Would you really want to work in the field?" Natalia asked and you shook your head "No, but having the option would have been nice." you said with a sulk making them laugh "Let's head back." Natalia said pulling both your hands pulling you guys up along with her.

            You were home before Ryan and was currently on the floor sitting in the living room watching tv, waiting till Ryan came home so you guys could take a bath together. "Hey baby, you in?" Ryan asked coming in through the door, so you got up from your position and made your way towards him "Hey." you said when he came into view and when he got a good look at you he gestured towards your clothes "Havenâ€™t showered yet?" you shook your head completely in front him now "Was waiting for you, so we could take a bath together." you told him and he captured your hips smirking down at you "Really?" he asked and you nodded "Yeah, I figured we both needed it, plus we cancelled our reservations for tonight, so this would be like a replacement sort of." you said bringing your hands up to rub his arms "Well that sounds perfect." Ryan said looking down at you and he was thinking about lifting you up so you could wrap your legs around his waist but he realized recently with the extra weight he has put on, you aren't able to, so he just settled for lifting you up and placing you over his shoulder making you yelp.

            "So did you guys have a good evening?" you asked Ryan as you both were sitting across from each other in the tub and he nodded "But was the sun hot." Ryan commented making you chuckle "Wish I could of joined you guys." you said with a tilt of your head and Ryan shook his head "I wouldn't want you out there. I preferred you in the garden." you raised a brow at that "Excuse me?" you asked "It's not anything bad, I just wouldn't want you working in the heat." he said so you tilted your head to the other side "You don't think I'm capable?" you asked curious and Ryan gulped "No no, I never thought that, you are very capable, I just preferred you to be in comfort." he said feeling nervous under your gaze but when he was finished a smile broke out on your face "I'm just messing with you babe." you said laughing lightly and Ryan sighed "I hate when you do that." he said, head falling back to rest on the tub rim. "Sorry." you said cutely closing the distance between you two, by sitting on his lap. You brought your hands up to his chest before placing a kiss there, that made him raise back up his head to look at you. "I'm sorry." you apologized once more and this time Ryan circled his arms around your waist bringing you closer and you realized his hesitation "What's wrong?" you asked sensing something was wrong but Ryan just shook his head "Nothing is." you tilted your head to the side not buying what he said and you look made him sigh before he confessed "Lately I've been hesitate with how I am towards you, like hugging you, lifting you up and even being in this position." Ryan said and you had an idea where he was going but you prefer him to say it just to make sure that that was the problem "Why?" you asked him just wanting to be sure "Because of my tummy. I can't hold you flush against me like I used to and it upsets me sometimes thinking that you hate it." Ryan said and you saw there was a flash of hurt between his eyes so you immediately brought your hands up to capture his face "Ryan, believe me when I say this. I love how you look, it has become a personal favourite look of mine. And no I'm nowhere near to hating how you've become. Yes, how you hold me may not be the same as before but that doesn't mean I love it any less. If you want to be big like this, I will love and accept it, and even if you want to get bigger to the point I can't wrap my arms around you anymore, guess what. My love, affection or attraction for you won't change one bit. So believe me when I say I love how you look no matter what, as long as you're healthy and happy, look how you want." you told him truthfully squeezing his cheeks and Ryan's eyes softened wondering how he got so lucky to have someone like you "Thank you, I have been feeling a bit self-conscience thinking that maybe you weren't a fan of the new look. But you just reassured me how amazing you are and that I don't deserve you." the moment those words left his mouth you planted a kiss on his lips "What did I tell you about speaking like that about yourself. Stop it." you scolded him and Ryan chuckled "Yes mam. I love you." he said looking up at you, tightening his arms around you and you smoothed out his cheeks with your thumbs "And I love you, all of you." you said smiling down at him before he captured your lips with his.
