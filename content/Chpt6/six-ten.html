            "Hey hey, good morning." Natalia said as she entered the locker room, greeting you "Good morning." you greeted her back. "Doing okay?" you asked her and she made a noise before replying "Not really, a bit annoyed actually." "What's up?" you asked with concern so she closed her locker and turned to you "Jessie never showed up." "Did he at least call?" you asked closing your locker now, giving her your full attention. She shook her head with a sigh "Well that's not very nice of him." "It wasn't but don't mention anything about this to him okay?" you nodded "I won't say a word, and for all I know, you guys never made plans." you told her with a smile which she returned "Thank you. Ready to head up?" she asked and you nodded so you both left the locker room together to go start your work day.

            While Ryan and Natalia were out with Calleigh and Jessie following up a lead for the case, they encountered a booby trap of sorts that resulted in them running for their lives to escaped a bomb, they didn't completely escape because they were still inside when it went off, knocking them unconscious for a while. Ryan was the first awake while Natalia was trapped so when Ryan started to help lift a pillar off of her, H showed up and help, and they all got out, and awaited medical attention. After Ryan got his arm bandaged he went to check on Natalia, and so they could go to the ER together to get checked out but Natalia said she was okay and wanted to start back working on the case, and Ryan would of done the same thing but having you as his wife, he made sure to head to the ER nonetheless cause if you found out he didn't go, you would drag him there yourself. So after getting checked out and declared well, he left and head home to change his clothes before returning back to the station.

            You were in the lab when you heard what happened, so immediately you tried calling Ryan, but his phone kept going to voice mail.  You know he was okay, but your heart would only fully settle until you see or hear his voice yourself. But for the time being to keep yourself distracted you focused on work, knowing that the moment he's back at the lab he'll come look for you.

            With tablet in hand, you were just about to leave when Ryan entered, catching you off guard but you quickly composed and closed the distance between you to "Ryan." you said his name as you wrapped your arms around him "You're okay." you said, but mostly to calm your heart "Of course I am." Ryan said pulling closer to him just so you would know that he's here with you. "You had me worried there for a moment." you said pulling away to look up at him so Ryan smiled down at you "I'm sorry about that. I would of gotten here sooner but I made sure to stop by the ER first to get checked out." that made smile "Walk with me." you said picking back up the tablet ready to leave again and Ryan nodded "Cause you know I would of dragged you there?" you questioned looking up at him and Ryan chuckled "Yes, so I wanted to spare your wrath, and did the right thing." "Smart, but you sure you're okay?" you asked Ryan just wanting to be sure and he nodded "I'm good, minus a little injury on my arm." he said lifting his jacket covered arm to show you which one "I got it bandaged up." "Does it hurt?" you asked, concerned laced in your voice "No mam, I am a okay." Ryan said calming your heart and you felt completely better after being with him for that short time as he walked you to your destination.

            You and Ryan were all settled down for the evening and were currently on the sofa, Ryan watching tv, while you were reading. "Did Natalia seem like she was acting weird after the incident?" said Ryan pulling you from your book, so you thought for a moment before replying "Yeah, a bit. When I was calling for her, it's like she couldn't hear me, although I was right next to her." you said looking up from your book towards Ryan "Why, something happened?" you asked curious "I think she's suffering from hear loss since the explosion and when I asked her about it, she denied it." "If that's the case why did she deny it?" you questioned and Ryan tilted his head to the side "The same reason I lied about my eyes being fine." Ryan said making you understand "What is up with you guys and never facing your problems, you know that's not very healthy." you said with a raised brow and Ryan released a nervous chuckle "I guess we fear that we could lose our jobs." "I get that, but the longer you guys suffer in silence the worse it always get, before you guys just tackle the problem right then and there." Ryan said at that "Which is easier said than done." Ryan commented making you roll your eyes "I'll talk to her tomorrow and see if I could get her to visit a doctor." you said lifting back up your book "Don't let her know that I mentioned this because I think it might not go well and she might get defensive." Ryan said making you look at him with a chuckle "Because you can't keep out of peoples business." Ryan gave you a look "I don't know what you mean." he said so you raised a brow "Oh really, the other day weren't you being nosey towards Jessie?" you questioned and Ryan gave a look of realization "How do you know about that?" "Because he came and made a complaint to me about it." Ryan gave you a shy smile "Sorry." he apologized "I don't think you are, because if you were, you wouldn't keep doing it although I've told you a million times to stop." you said practically scolding Ryan "But it clearly shows you can't help yourself, you're more Bajan than." you chuckled softly at the end "What do you mean?" Ryan questioned "There's a saying that Bajan are very malicious people. As in we are very nosey people, always in someone else's business." you said with a laugh now "And you're a perfect example of that." you stated making Ryan laugh and he shrugged "It's just how I am, but I am truly sorry and I didn't mean to really pry in Jessie's life." you just shook your head turning back to your book "I know this isn't going to be the last time this happens." "Have a little faith in me babe." Ryan said pulling your feet to rest in his lap "I'll get the faith when I see you not pry." you said making Ryan laugh before he turned back to the tv.
