            "So I was thinking, dinner and the movies after work?" Ryan asked looking towards you in the mirror as you both were brushing your teeth "That sounds perfect." you said with a grin making Ryan's heart warmed "Then it's a date." with that you both finished brush your teeth before leaving the bathroom to get ready for work "I hope today is a normal day." Ryan commented with a sigh so you smacked his arm "Don't call it babe. Why would you say that?" you scolded with a shake of your head "What?" Ryan asked confused "Don't you know in this line of work, when you wish for a normal day, you get the complete opposite." "That's silly babe." Ryan said with a chuckle and you gave him a look before pointing your finger "For all our sake, I hope you're right."

            Ryan was in fact wrong. He was involved in a chase, running after the suspect and Delko turned out to be working for the defense, so it's going to be a very long day and nothing about it will be normal.

            "Small bear, how art thou?" Walter announced as he entered the lab, heading to the other surface computer "Not doing too bad big bear, what do you have there?" you asked Walter as you watched place down a box on the computer surface "A box full of files of the previous victims." that made you left your station coming over to him "Oou, interesting. May I?" you asked gesturing to the box and Walter nodded "You may, what are you going to do?" he asked looking on as you opened the box "Show you something super cool that's going to make your life so much easier." you took out a file and got to explaining "As you know these files carries microchips." you started and Walter nodded "Well, with the program I created, you can just put the file on the computer surface like this, and the computer will read the file, and capture all the information from it." you said demonstrating and there was a look of amazement on Walter's face "No way! Are you serious?" you nodded and pulled up the contents for him to see, and he would not stop smiling in amazement "That's so cool." he said but you held up a finger to pause him "But that's not all." you said and Walter widened his eyes "There's more?" he asked and you nodded. Picking back up the file, you placed it back in the box "Since all the files in this box contains microchips, we can just put the box on and load up all the files in one go." you said demonstrating once again and Walter was blown away "There's no way you created this." Walter said making you chuckle "You're like smart smart." you shrugged at the compliment "Thanks, so if you need to find anything within them, you can just search by keyword and it would be displayed." you told Walter but he was still stunned "There's just no way." you chuckled leaving him in his amazement "Shoot if you need me." you said as you head back to your own computer.

            "Heather." whined Ryan as he entered your lab making you chuckle "What has happened to my husband?" you asked as he came over to stand next to you "I have jinxed the day, you were right." Ryan said resting his head on your shoulder "Talk to me." you said pausing what you were doing to look at him as he stood back up "Eric Delko happened. Did you hear he was working for the defense?" Ryan asked and you nodded "I did, was shocked honestly. You too aren't that much different." you said with a chuckle and Ryan gave you a deadpan look "Sorry, not funny." you quickly  put on a straight face "I'm going to ignore you said that, did you also hear that we're being filmed?" you gave Ryan a confused look "Filmed, what do you mean?" you questioned "By Delko, I hate it." when he said that you brought your hand up to caress his arm "I'm sorry, I know it must suck, but he's just doing his job, the same way you were doing yours when you were working for the defense." you commented and Ryan gave you a look once again "Going to keep reminding me about it?" Ryan asked and just as you were about to reply Jessie entered "Hey guys, Heather you busy?" Jessie coming over to you two "Was just gathering some info for Paul, why?" you asked looking towards him "I need your computer smarts at the crime scene." Jessie said giving you a smile which you returned "You got it, just let me finish this up then I'll meet you." you told him and Jessie nodded "Okay, downstairs in fifteen sounds good?" he asked and you nodded "Okay, thanks." he said before giving Ryan a nod and leaving "Look at my wife doing field work." Ryan commented with a proud smile "I'm an unofficial CSI you know, now leave and let me finish this up so I can meet Jessie." you said and Ryan raised is hands "Yes CSI Wolfe." Ryan said with a chuckle making you laugh as well before he left you.

            Both you and Jessie arrived at the crime scene and he took you to where your expertise was needed "You think our computer geek might have left us a trail?" Jessie asked you both entered the main room and you had your laptop in hand ready to get started. You sat down in front the computer and opened your laptop "Well, the ram a the computer keeps a volatile record of every action taken and every communication made so, if he left us a cool, it should still be here." you told Jessie before holding up a drive "And this little device, captures all that live evidence." you said as you inserted it into the computer. Jessie leaned over you as he looked on. When everything was loaded into the drive you removed it and inserted it into your own laptop now "If Justin Porter worked on this computer, he may have left something behind, that may help us locate him." you said as you pulled up the program on yours. You were typing away as Jessie looked on and he had not a clue what he was looking at "So?" he asked "Easy dimples, it takes time." you commented "Ya'll find anything?" came Calleigh's voice as she approached you guys and Jessie gave her the 'be quiet' gesture, finger on lips. You too focused on what you were doing to see the interaction "The computer's webcam was activated this morning as the same time as the attack." you said looking up towards Calleigh "Shot a video for twenty minutes." you said with uneasiness in your voice "That's interesting. Isn't this the room that Horatio thinks someone was attacked in?" Calleigh asked Jessie as he looked around the room "You think the rapist recorded the attack?" Jessie asked her back "It's possible. I mean, he makes his victims cook him breakfast, sick and twisted his is style." Calleigh told him before looking back to you "Can we see the video?" she asked and you shook your head before replying "The file was emailed then erased. As much as I hate to admit it, he's good. He routed the file through his own network. Computers and emails has already been hacked into. He did it to cover his tracks." you told Jessie and Calleigh, eyes not leaving your laptop screen "This could take months to locate a destination." you stated looking at Calleigh now "What about Ellen Cheffield, the other victim?" Calleigh asked looking between you and Jessie "Yeah, if he recorded Summer's attack, he probably recorded Ellan's too." Jessie replied catching on to what Calleigh was suggesting "She said he ran off when the doorbell rang. It is possible he didn't have enough time to cover his tracks." Calleigh said, and that's when they decided to get Ellan's laptop before returning to the lab, so you could find whatever was hidden on it.

            You three were back in the lab now, you behind the computer connected the laptop searching for the video, while Calleigh and Jessie stood near the bring screen. You found the video and pulled it up "I just think it's completely demented, this guy would use her own computer to record the rape." Calleigh said as the video started to play, and you honestly didn't want to watch it, if Dave wasn't on his lunch break, you would of asked him to switch places with you. So while the video played you looked away from the screen not wanting to see any of it. Calleigh looked back towards you to ask something but she also saw that you were looking the opposite direction "Heather." she called your name making you look around, and gave a comforting smile before asking her request "Will you fast forward past this part please?" you nodded "Of course." looking back at the screen, you fast forward the video "Wait, go back." Jessie said halting your process, making you rewind "Well, there's our guy." Jessie said as you paused the video where the guy was standing on screen, showing his face. So you zoomed in "This creep never erased the video because he never had a chance to send it." you commented annoyed but just that moment the computer beeped so you immediately looked to see what was happening "Wait a second. Guys, someone is trying to access Ellen's hard drive remotely. Like right now as we speak." you said panicked "Who?" Jessie asked looking towards you "I don't have a name but I have an extra IP address." "Can you trace it to a geographical location?" Calleigh asked you "I'm already on it." you said tracking the address, you pulled it up on the big screen for the others to see "Well that's a self-storage facility." Jessie said when the location appeared "Is there a way that this is another zombified computer?" Calleigh asked turning your direction, you shook your head "Definitely not, this is the source. Our suspect is there, right now." the moment those words left your lips, Jessie and Calleigh were out the door.

            Your shift was over but you were currently moving in slow motion as you finished up in your lap. Calleigh talked to Ryan to keep an eye on your after watching that disturbing video "She helped us retrieve the video that Justin recorded." Calleigh told Ryan "Did she watch it?" Ryan asked, concerned laced in his voice Calleigh shook her head "She couldn't, she had her head turned away. I know she's not doing well, so just a head's up." Calleigh told Ryan he nodded "Thanks." Ryan said before they parted ways. He headed the direction of your lab, just in case you were still in there so you both could walk down together to the locker room. When he reached the outside he looked in and saw you standing there looking lost, and moving slow, so he knocked on the door to capture your attention before entering "Hey beautiful." Ryan greeted entering so you looked up towards his direction and he saw pain in your eyes "Did you get him?" you asked Ryan as he made his way over to you and he nodded "We did, thanks to you." Ryan said with a smile at the end and that made you feel somewhat better "That's good." you said with a release of breath "Ready to head down?" Ryan asked, he could see you were hurting and just wished he could take it all away "Yeah, I just have to finish one thing. You could on without me." you told Ryan and he shook his head giving you a smile "I don't mind waiting." he said truthfully and that brought a smile to your face "Thank you." you said towards him before turning back to your computer to finish up what you were doing. "All done." you said turning away looking to Ryan as he was next to you "Ready now?" he asked and you nodded, so he held out his hand for you to take and you chuckled "We're at work Ryan." you commented looking around "Okay, but the moment we leave the building, I'm hold your hand." he said making you release a small laugh "I will accept that." he placed his hand on the small of your back as he lead you out the room, and he dropped it back to his side going into his pockets as you both walked side by side. "How comes you came to walk down with me? I don't mind it but we usually meet in the locker room." you questioned "Well, I spoke with Calleigh, and I found out how involved you were with the case." Ryan said giving you a sad smile "She told me that she sensed you weren't doing, and I know this topic is not a fan of yours, so I just want to be here for you." what Ryan said softened your heart, making you smile towards him "Thank you." you said halting and Ryan did as well following you "Always beautiful." with that not caring anymore that you're at work, you closed the distance between you too, and hugged him and Ryan gladly accepted it, pulling you into his embrace cause he knows you needed it "Let's cancel our plans for this evening and just let me pamper you." Ryan suggested as you both pulled away and you smiled at that "You pamper me?" you asked as you both continued walking and Ryan nodded "Yes, the whole experience." Ryan said making arm gestures making you chuckle "Okay Mr. Wolfe, I can't wait to see this whole experience." you both chuckled at that.

            "If it isn't CSI Wolfe." Walter cheered as he saw you and Ryan enter the locker room "What did I do now?" Ryan asked completely confused and Walter shook his head "Not you Ryan, you're not the only Wolfe here." Walter commented before looking towards you, so you halted and pointed at yourself "Me, I'm no CSI." you stated before heading to your locker "I beg to differ." Jessie started before closing his locker to look towards you "You were pretty badass today." that compliment made you smile "But I didn't do anything special, if anything it was you guys. You caught the men responsible for the crimes." you stated and everyone shook their head "We wouldn't have gotten them if it wasn't for you Heather, or should I say CSI Wolfe." Calleigh said with a chuckle and you shook your head "Whenever you say that, it's like you're referring to Ryan." you said with a face and they all laugh "True, true, because he does announce himself as CSI Wolfe. What was your previous surname?" Walter asked and Ryan interjected "No no, she's not using her previous name, she's a Wolfe." Ryan said making everyone laugh and you just shook your head "I'm starting to see the obsession. I guess we can just say CSI Heather." Jessie commented "That sounds good, although it's the first name." Calleigh said agreeing with Jessie, now it was your turn to say something "You guys are taking this so serious like I'm actual CSI." you chuckled "You are Heather. You're one of us, and you brought something to the team that made us better." Calleigh said smiling your way and that made your smile grew even wider "And that program you created, I'm still mind blown as to how it can read files." Walter said and your heart just swelled "Thank you so much guys. I'm going to hug you all." you said going around hugging them all which they all accepted "What about my hug?" Ryan asked you "You got one before we came downstairs." that made everyone laugh.
