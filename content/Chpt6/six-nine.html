            "So what are you going to do today?" you asked Ryan as you got dressed for work "Maybe run some errands, and get some rest." Ryan told you trying to not raise any suspicion "That sounds good. Hopefully you don't get call into work and can enjoy an actual off day." you commented looking towards him and Ryan chuckled "Fingers crossed." little did you know Ryan did had work, somewhere else.

            Ryan was currently inspecting a fish tank that contained some deadly jelly fish. His name was called and he told the guy about the jelly fish "I'm not paying you to watch fish, you're here to look out for bad guys." his boss told him "Yes boss, so do you see any bad guys?" Ryan asked going along, "That guy right there." his boss pointed with his head and Ryan followed his line of direction and when Ryan saw who it was he smiled "What makes you think he's one?" Ryan asked curious knowing that he's nothing but "The way he moves, like he's looking for someone." Ryan's boss stated so Ryan nodded hiding his smile "You know what, I'll go check it out." Ryan told him before heading the direction of the guy. When Ryan approached he tapped his shoulder "Excuse me sir, there seems to be a problem." Ryan said and at that Jessie turned around with a surprised look "Ryan, what are you doing here?" Jessie asked and Ryan smiled wide "Just working, trying to get some extra cash. I'm saving up for a surprise for Heather so you never saw me here." Ryan told him in secrecy "You got it, I never saw you." Jessie assured Ryan "Thanks. Look at you, you look gorgeous." Ryan commented smoothing down the front of Jessie's jacket making him grin and they talked for a bit more before a scream was heard. And that's how Ryan and Jessie's off day turned into an official work day.

            The first chance that Ryan got when he was available while at the lab, he went to look for you. "The next set of updates should be this weekend." you said to Dave, as you guys were discussing some stuff "Okay, and I should be able to help this time." Dave said making you smile "Really?!" you asked excited and he nodded "You've taught me well enough." "That's what I like to hear." you said as you guys shared a high five, and just that moment came a knock making you both look towards the sound "Hey guys." Ryan greeted as he entered the lab "Ryan! What are you doing here?" "Work." you said heading over to him "I'll be back." you told Dave and he and Ryan shared a nod before you both went outside to talk "Just when I thought you would have an official of day." you commented with a chuckle "Nah, I don't mind, the extra money is always welcomed." Ryan said and you inspected what he was wearing "Dressed a bit fancy are we." you asked, he was wearing a black dress suit along with a white button up, cause usually on his off days when called in, he would just wear a t-shirt and jeans. "Just felt like switching it up." Ryan lied but you bought it not thinking too much about it "Well I think you look very handsome." you complimented fixing his jacket. "Why thank you babe. Well I just came by to let you know I was here, so I'll be going" Ryan said and you nodded "Sure." you gave him a wink before entering back your lab and Ryan watched you before walking away. 'I hope it doesn't get out that I've been working at the venue.' Ryan thought as he walked away.

            You were in the lab when Jessie came by to get some help from you. "Heather, your assistance is needed." Jessie announced as he entered the room making to towards him "How may I be of service?" you asked and he came next to you, and he told you what he wanted, while working Jessie made a comment "You know that your husband is very nosey." Jessie said making you sigh "Sadly that I know. I've been telling him to stop it but it's like it goes through one ear and comes out the other. Has he been nagging you?" you asked giving Jessie a sorrowful look "Yeah, from when he saw me this morning, just something he wouldn't let go." Jessie said but you gave him a look of confusion "What happened this morning?" you asked confused and Jessie realized he made a mistake, cause you weren't supposed to know about Ryan working "Oh, I meant while at the station, but it's nothing really." Jessie said hoping you don't question further or notice his change of words "Okay, well I will talk to him for you and I do apologize on his behalf, he's always been like this." you said making Jessie chuckle "I think the whole team is like that" Jessie commented and you nodded "They are, but Ryan's the worst of them." you said turning back to the screen "That I can see." you chuckled "Don't worry, I'll tell him to leave you be." "Thanks short stuff." Jessie said giving you an appreciative smile "Anytime dimples." you returned a smile back before you both turned back to the screen.

            You were on your way back from the bathroom and was currently passing a lab when you saw Natalia inside, so you gave the glass a knock before entering making her look up at you "I was hoping to see you." you said coming towards her "I hope I'm not in trouble." she commented smiling towards you so you shook your head "Of course not, just wanted to know if you wanted to hang out after work and get a drink?" you asked her hopeful and but she sighed "Sorry, I already have plans." she said with a not so subtle smile so you raised a brow at that "Girl, spill." you said so she gestured you closer and looked around before telling you "Jessie asked me to go for drinks." Natalia said and your eyes widened and mouth a gaped "Excuse me. Interesting." you commented and Natalia laughed at your reaction "It's honestly nothing, it's just something he's got to explain, cause I don't know if you heard, but everyone has been in his business today." you nodded at that "I did hear. You guys are something else." "You're no better." Natalia said so you shushed her and you both laughed at that "Well, enjoy your drinks and we'll hang out another time, and you know I'll want the details tomorrow." you said with a wink starting to make your way out the lab "Nothing's going to happen Heather." Natalia called after you "Right, and I don't have hair." you said before disappearing making her chuckle and shake her head at you.

            It was the end of your shift and you were in the locker room when Natalia entered "Eyebrows eyebrows." you said wiggling your eyebrows making Natalia laugh at you "Behave Heather, it's going to be nothing." you raised your hands "Okay okay, I'll stop, but do have fun though, but not too much fun." you said making Natalia reach across to smack your arm "The abuse, I'm going to have to report you." you said with a gasp and you both broke out laughing "By the way, I wanted to ask you, how long has Ryan been working as a security detail?" Natalia asked leaving you confused "What do you mean?" you asked looking towards her "This morning, when he was working for the charity event, just wanted to know how long that's been going on for." now you were completely lost "I'm super confused, Ryan was at the charity event as security detail?" you asked and Natalia gave you a look before slowly nodding "You sound like you don't know about it." "That's because I don't. It was supposed to be his off day. I left him this morning home and in bed." you said and Natalia gave an apologetic look "I'm sorry, but I'm sure it's nothing." Natalia said as she closed her locker, all you could do was nod "I gotta go, keep me posted." she said taking hold of your arm so you nodded "Same to you." you said with a quick smile which she returned before leaving.

            You were home before Ryan because he had some extra paper work to do, so you were currently in the kitchen cooking dinner, music playing in the background hoping it would help you with your overthinking of what Natalia told you about Ryan, but sadly the music wasn't helping and your mind was racing a mile a minute. You were so caught up in thought that you didn't hear Ryan when he entered. It was only when he turned off the music that you noticed the sudden silence, so looking towards the source you saw Ryan there with a smile on his "Hey, I was calling for you, but I figured you couldnâ€™t hear me over the music." "Oh, sorry, I was lost in thought." you sent a smile his way stopping what you were doing "What's going on, because you only get that caught up in your mind when it's something serious?" Ryan asked concerned written over his face as he made his way over to the island "It was something Natalia asked me today." you said turning towards Ryan, "Can you share or is it personal?" Ryan asked as he sat on one of the chairs by the island so you stood the other side to meet his eyes "It was about you actually." you started then clasped your hands on the counter before continuing "She asked me how long have you been working in security detail." you said looking into Ryan's eyes looking for any kind of emotion that could give him away. All you saw was guilt, someone that has been caught in the act "Okay, I guess this doesn't look good." Ryan said and you shook your head "No, it doesn't, because you could imagine my reaction when she asked me something about my husband that I have no clue about." you said trying your best to remain calm, so Ryan sigh "Okay, where to start." he said and you interjected "From the beginning." you said sternly so Ryan took a deep breath before starting "I have been working odd jobs, here and there on my off days, like for example today, I was working as a security detail for the charity event." Ryan said and you listened, you weren't mad, you just wanted to know why he didn't tell you "Why? Why have you been working these jobs cause you know if it's money you need you can always ask me, but most importantly why keep it from me?" you asked a little hurt at the end and Ryan sensed it "Well I guess the cat has to come out the bag. I've been wanting to plan a surprise trip for you, well us, and I wanted to pay for the whole thing, where you have to worry about nothing, just being there and living in the moment. That's why the extra jobs or shifts, to get the funds to pay for it." the moment those words left his mouth you heart softened then followed your body, instantly you felt bad for almost getting mad at him. Ryan hated that he had to lie about the true intentions of the money but it was so you won't stop him, cause the moment you found out about the house, you'll want to help. "Ryan." you said as you walked across the counter to him "I'm sorry. For keeping that from you, and lying to you." while in front him now, you pulled him into a hug which he accept "That's okay, you had your reasons and they were good ones." you told him pulling away but kept him at arm's length "But the surprise is ruined." Ryan said, hands capturing your waist now so you shook your head "No, it's not, I can go back to not knowing. Like this, what surprise are you talking about babe?" you said smiling and Ryan chuckled "Thank you, and no I will not accept any help from you." Ryan said cause he know you might try and offer help so you gave a look of confusion "Help with what, you're speaking cryptic Ryan." you said still playing along and Ryan laughed now "Okay okay, I will not speak of the surprise but I will let you know when I'm working outside being a CSI." Ryan said and you nodded "Thank you. I appreciate that." you brought your hand up to capture his cheek with a smile "Good, because I hated having to hide from you." "Well you're in the clear." you shared a smile being sharing a kiss "Thank you. Need help with dinner?" Ryan asked and you shook your head "I'm soon finished, you can go shower in the meantime." you said moving out is arms "Yes mam." he kissed your forehead disappearing.
