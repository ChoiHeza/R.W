            "A reminder, I'm hanging out with the guys tonight." you said as you both were at the kitchen island eating breakfast, and that caused Ryan to raise a brow "The guys?" he questioned "Yeah, Jessie and Walter, we're going to watch a basketball game." the look of realization crossed Ryan's features "Ah, the game you invited me to tag along with but I know better than to." Ryan said making you chuckle "I think you should, it's going to be fun." when you said that Ryan gave you a look "I highly doubt that. Remember the you and Delko incident, and it clearly shows that they're big fans just as you, so I could imagine the behaviour knowing it's three of you." Ryan said with a shake of his head "But you don't mind right, me hanging out with them?" you asked Ryan seriously and waited for his reply "Of course not, I like those guys. They clearly have no ill intentions with you and they make you feel included. Plus I love seeing you happy and they contribute to that, so I don't mind one bit." Ryan said honestly smiling towards you "Thank you. But honestly speaking, I thought you would have been jealous of Jessie, cause Natalia told me she had a feeling you would have been." you said as you finished your cereal and Ryan chuckled "Well. . ., you guys aren't wrong." Ryan said with a shy smile "You were or are?" you asked curious "I was, when I first met him and heard you had a nickname for him because have you seen the guy, he's really handsome, and I know you aren't blind. But I know you would just see that and nothing more, also it helped since Dave, plus I trust you." Ryan said making you smile "So you aren't anymore?" you asked and he shook his head "No mam. After seeing you guys together, it's more like sibling energy between you and he's very respectful." Ryan said truthfully making you smile even wider as you moved to the sink with bowl in hand "Thank you." you said and Ryan stood up "What for?" he asked as he was next to you now, so you turned and took hold of his hands "For not being overly jealous, and trusting me knowing that I won't ever cheat on you or look at another guy the way I look at you." with your hands connected he brought them to connect behind your back along with his, pulling you closer towards him "It's not you that I worry about, because I know you won't, it's the guy that I worry about, but Jessie and Walter are safe." Ryan said smiling down at you before pecking your lips "Plus, they're like protection detail when I'm not with you." Ryan said making you laugh "Only you would say something like that." you said rolling your eyes stepping out of his arms "What?" "Nothing. Weâ€™re still going to lunch together today?" you asked and Ryan nodded "Yeah, once no interruptions, but I'll let you know."

            They was in fact and interruption with you guys lunching together. While at the crime scene Ryan checked his watch and saw he should be on his lunch break with you "Shit." Ryan swore and that made Walter look towards him "What's wrong?" "Heather, we had lunch plans. How about this, let me tell you what happened here, Victor came out of the stop sign too fast, into oncoming traffic, end of case, let's go eat." Ryan said quickly hoping that works "Well, the case isn't close till we got some solid and physical evidence my friend." Walter said crushing Ryan "I'm hungry and Heather will be very pissed if I cancel on her." Ryan said but Walter gave him a deadpan look "We both know that's not true. I bet you she'll say, that she'll wait for you." Walter said with a smart smile and a tilt of his head "Alright, bet." Ryan said pulling out his phone to call you, hitting your number he put it on speaker "This is Wolfe." came your voice and Walter chuckled knowing that Ryan's thing "Hey babe, look, I have to cancel lunch because there's been a turn in the case so we gotta look over everything in scene." Ryan said sorrowful and waited for your reply "That's okay, I'll wait for you, I don't mind." you told him and Walter pointed his finger as in saying 'I told you so' making Ryan shake his head "Whatever Walter. You don't mind right?" Ryan asked you "Walter's with you?" "Yes small bear, I'm here." Walter answered for himself "Oh perfect, how about you join us for lunch when you guys are finished there, just give me a call when you both are back." you said making Walter smile and Ryan as well "You don't mind right, Ryan?" "Of course not." "Perfect, now you guys hurry along, and I'll see you later." "Okay baby. Bye." "Byee small bear." Walter said making you chuckle "Bye babe, byee big bear." you said before hanging up. Ryan turned and looked at Walter "You just hand to one up me huh?" Walter shrugged "I don't know what you're talking about, but I have realized something." "What's that?" Ryan asked curious "She's speaking normal." Walter said with a smile and Ryan grin "Yeah, we had a talk, I'll tell you over lunch. We gotta focus back on this scene." Ryan and Walter agreed before they turned back to work.

            Ryan and Walter were currently in the lab processing the family's shoes "Calleigh told me the husband was devastated." Ryan said as he was inspecting one of the shoes "Could you blame him. He just lost his wife and now looks like one of his kids caused the accident. Not to mention he was being cheated on." Walter said coming over to him "Be careful with that information because the husband was never told." Ryan said giving him a brief look "What? The guy doesn't know the worst of it?" Walter was shocked to hear this "Wasn't pertinent to the case." Ryan said flatly and Walter gave him a look making Ryan continue "Look, his wife just died, what good would it do to let him know that his wife was also cheating on him." Ryan told him with a raised brows at the end "Wouldn't you want to know if Heather was cheating on you?" Walter asked and Ryan gave it some thought "Yeah I would but Heather wouldn't do that, so I don't have to worry about that." Ryan stated making Walter chuckle "Must be nice." he said before they went back to inspecting the shoes.

            "So Ryan, are you tagging along with us?" Jessie asked "I don't think I will." Ryan replied "Got other plans Wolfe?" Walter asked and Ryan shook his head "Nah, I'm probably just going to watch tv." Ryan said as he was looking through his locker, so Jessie and Walter gave you a questioning look "If it involves me and basketball with other people, he stays far away." you said with a chuckle "I don't understand." Jessie voiced and Ryan was the one to speak this time to explain "It started when I went to a game with her and Delko, they behaved so bad, you would think they were the coach" Ryan said and you sighed "I'm not that bad." you stated making Ryan gave Jessie and Walter a look "I agree, Heather doesn't behave badly." Walter said defending you "That means you're probably just like her, cause Delko says the same thing." Ryan said making Jessie laugh "Well, I guess we will see tonight how it goes." he said "So you're embarrassed of her?" Walter asked Ryan and that made you look toward him as well "Maybe." Ryan said with hesitation making you gasp "You are?!" you were shocked cause you didn't know "Well, it's also more along the lines of not getting the hype." Walter tsked at Ryan "Disappointed Wolfe." he was shaking his head as well.

            Ryan was laying in the bed watching tv as you got dressed to head out. You had on your team jersey and looked like a full on supporter. You went over to the mirror and did a once over your outfit to make sure everything was in place. "Okay, babe, I'm leaving." you said picking up your bag, before starting to leave the bedroom but Ryan halted you "Wait, no kiss, no goodbye?" Ryan questioned as he moved off the bed "Oh, I didn't think you would want one from me since you're too embarrassed to be around me." you said in monotone and Ryan sighed, as he moved to be in front you now "Look babe, I'm sorry." Ryan said and you shook your head "It's okay, you're entitled to your own opinion. Look I gotta go." you said turning to leave but Ryan held onto your hand "No, you're not leaving while you're annoyed at me." Ryan said giving you a look so you sighed cause you knew he was right "I am sorry, okay, I mean it. When I said that it wasn't like I hated hanging out with you while you're enjoying something you love, I just felt left out, okay. Like I was third wheeling with you guys, and yes you are loud when watching the sport, but that doesn't mean that I love you any less, and I stopped going because that's you're thing that you get to enjoy for you." Ryan said truthfully and your heart softened "I guess that makes me feel better, or whatever." you said trying to push down your smile but Ryan smile widely "I don't ever want to make you feel bad about something that you love or enjoy, so if I came across that way, I apologize, and I didn't mean to." Ryan said taking both your hands in his now, so the smile finally appeared on your face "I know you didn't meant it that way, but it did still hurt nonetheless, but thank you for clarifying." you told him while giving his hands a squeeze "I'm sorry again. But go and have fun and be as loud as you can while not having a care, because you're doing what you love." Ryan said making you laugh, so you leaned up and pecked his lips "Thanks babe." "Of course." when you're happy, Ryan is happy.
