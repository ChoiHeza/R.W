            It has been a month since Ryan last saw you, and he was missing you dearly but in the meantime while you were away, he decided to be productive, so when you returned, you'll be coming back to a better version of himself. Ryan was currently getting ready for work when he heard his phone ring, so pausing what he was doing, he went and picked up the phone, seeing your name pop up brought a wide smile to his face, so he answered putting it on speaker phone "Good morning beautiful, what are you doing up?" Ryan asked because of the time difference, you were three hours behind "Good morning, couldn't sleep anymore and I felt like hearing your voice." you said with a yawn and that warmed Ryan's heart "You sound tired, you should try getting more sleep before you have to start work." Ryan said as he moved about the bedroom "I can try but I won't succeed, plus I rather speak to you." Ryan smiled at that "Okay, I won't force you. How is it going over there?" "It's all still smooth sailing, minus being homesick, but the team here are amazing, and they make me feel so welcomed." Ryan smiled at that knowing you were okay "My baby is homesick, how much longer before you come home, the guys here miss you." that made you smile "Should be one more week." you lied, little did Ryan know that you were coming back today, you were going to surprise him "A week seems like such a long time." Ryan commented and just as you were going to reply Ryan's phone beeped "Babe this is work, I gotta go, it seems like something happened." "Okay, go go, and be safe." you quickly told him "Always, I love you." Ryan said then quickly hung up not giving you a chance to say it back making you chuckle and shake your head.

            "Heather you have to come back and visit." Greg stated and as you were in the break room with him and Hodges "You know I will, I love it here and it's so different from Miami." you said truthfully, you've really enjoyed your time here "And I guess when you return you can bring your husband with you or whatever." Hodges said making you laugh, he took a liking to you and was bummed when he found out that you were married, both him and Greg, but in the end they were cool and the ones you were closest too while here "I still wondered who would of won that bet." Greg pondered. Both him and Hodges made a bet to see who would ask you out first and who you would say yes too. You took no offense to it honestly because at the end of the day you were married and it didn't matter "I am curious about that as well." you said with a ponder expression making them gasp at you "It clearly would have been me." Hodges said taking a sip from his cup "I beg to differ Hodge, I'm clearly the more lovable one." Greg protested but Hodges wasn't having it "But I'm funnier and women love funny." and that's how it started the two of them bickering about who you would of picked. They didn't even notice when Dr. Ray came by and gestured for you to follow him, so laughing you left the two and went with him to his office. "It really was a pleasure having you here with us Mrs. Wolfe. Who would of thought that we would of gotten a chance met again." Ray said smiling down at you "The pleasure was all mine sir." you guys talked some more before it was time to say your byes to everyone.

            Ryan's day wasn't as pleasant as yours, first running into a house on fire to save a boy that was already dead, Calleigh getting caught up with the smoke and ending up in the hospital on a ventilator, then finding out the fire wasn't an accident but much more. So Ryan had a very long day and he just couldn't wait to get home and wait for your call. Ryan was currently in the locker with Walter getting ready to leave "How much longer till she returns?" Walter asked "When I asked her this morning she told me a week." Ryan said "That'll get here right now." Walter said with comfort cause he knew Ryan was missing you dearly. "I know." to lighten the mood, Walter decided to change the topic "I see you've been hitting the gym." Ryan smiled at that "Yeah man, had a lot of free time so I said why not plus, Heather's not here filling me up with food, so losing the weight and replacing it with muscle is pretty easy." Ryan told him and Walter nodded "I can see that, and it's paying off, you look good." Walter complimented "Thanks man, hopefully Heather thinks so too, because she really loved my chubby phase." Ryan said with a chuckle "Knowing Heather, however you look, she'll love it." Walter said "You're right, so what are you doing tonight?" Ryan asked curious "Well, Jessie and I are watching the basketball game tonight." Walter said making Ryan groan "Never mind." Ryan replied making Walter chuckle "We're not that bad you know." Ryan gave him a look "I'm good thanks. I think I'll just sit around and wait for Heather's call." Walter laughed at that "Well, if you change your mind, you'll know where to find us." "I doubt my mind will change." Ryan said before closing his locker then turned to Walter "But thanks." "Don't mention it."

            You did a happy dance when you entered the apartment, because one, you were finally home and you've missed it so much and two, you've realized Ryan hadn't gotten home as yet. So quickly checking the time, you saw you had a good hour before he's supposed to come home, so you decided to cook him a nice meal, just so he had something nice to come home too plus you may have heard how his day went, with the fire incident knowing instantly that he had a very long day. When the food was finished you had enough time to shower, so you got clean and put on one of Ryan's t-shirts with just a pair of underwear, before getting your wind down book and  lying in bed deciding to read while waiting till Ryan gets home.
        </p>
        <p class="story">
            Outside, Ryan reached the apartment door and sighed before unlocking it and entering. He took off his shoes and rest down his bag before entering "Hello no one." Ryan said to himself, cause he misses you and wished you were here. So sighing once more, he shrugged off his jacket, heading towards the bedroom. You were so caught up in your book that you didn't hear Ryan when he entered the apartment. So entering the bedroom, Ryan was not expecting to see you there and boy was the sight beautiful, he had to stop paused for a moment in the door way and just stare at you because he was just hoping this wasn't a dream and that you're really here. Afraid of it being a dream, Ryan just remained there just in case, enjoying the view before him. You didn't know Ryan was standing there watching you until you got tired laying on your stomach that you went to move to your back when you spotted Ryan. He startled you a bit but immediately recovered "Ryan! Why didn't you let me know you were home?" you said getting up and coming over to him "I didn't want to do anything in case it was a dream." Ryan said with a wide smile and the moment you were in front him, he wrapped his arms around you lifting you up and giving yourselves a spin, making you giggle "I've missed you so much." Ryan said keeping you in his embrace before pulling away to look down at you with such a wide smile "And I've missed you." you grinned yourself and Ryan wasted no time in connecting his lips with yours, taking his sweet time, knowing that you're back with him "How I've missed this." Ryan said placing multiple kisses on your lips making you giggle "What happened to the week?" Ryan asked leaning back but keeping you in his hold "There was never a week, I just wanted to surprise you." you said massaging his arms but then you noticed something. "Hold on a minute." you said unwrapping Ryan's arms from around you so you can step away and check him out "You've lost weight, like a lot." you asked worried but Ryan wanted to reassure you that he's okay "Yeah, I've been hitting the gym more regular since I had a lot of free time and just wanted to look better for you, plus.." Ryan said then at the end, wrapping his arms back around your waist lifting you up, so you could wrap your legs around him "I love the way you wrap around me without my stomach in the way." Ryan said with a wink making you blush "Babe, you can't just say things like that." you said hiding your face in his neck and Ryan chuckled "Why not?" Ryan asked as he walked towards the bed before sitting, keeping you in his lap and you just shrugged "Maybe I should of said that I missed this sweet ass of yours." Ryan said moving his hands down to grip your bum "You surely gave me a nice view when I entered the bathroom just now." Ryan said making you blush even more "You clearly have gotten more shameless since I've been away." you commented with a raised brow "Not necessarily, that's just me missing this gorgeous body of yours." Ryan said running his hands along your bare thighs before reaching under your shirt to grip your bare waist "I can tell." you said as Ryan pulled you closer "Only you can do this to me." Ryan said while moving to place kisses in your neck but you stopped him "Wait." you said pushing him away "What, not in the mood?" Ryan asked concerned getting ready to move his hands from you but you nodded your head, keeping his hands in place "Yeah, I just forgot to mark the page in my book." you said with a sigh smile, getting up from Ryan's lap and he gave you an 'are you serious' look, so you shrugged with a "What?" "Your husband, that you haven’t seen in almost a month, that you're about to have sex with, and your first thoughts are marking your book?" Ryan asked trying to understand and you slowly nodded giving him a sheepish smile "Yeah, I would really hate to lose where I was." you said reaching across the bed for your book, and placing the bookmark in its rightful place and Ryan just watched you with a shake of his head. But he made sure that your book was safely marked before taking hold of your leg and pulling you towards him making your shriek. So he came to hover over you, face directly above yours "Anything else you need to do before I can have you to myself?" Ryan teased with a raised brow making you chuckle and shake our head "No sir, I'm all yours." you smiled up at him before raising your legs to wrap around his hips "We have a month to make up for." Ryan said kissing your cheeks "Then what are you waiting for Mr. Wolfe." you said with a wink and Ryan groaned before connecting his lips with yours.

            You were both sitting across from each other having a shared bath. Ryan was currently leaned back with his head on the rim while your head was still up, just admiring Ryan's new look. "I can feel you boring holes in me." Ryan said not even looking up "So what if I'm staring?" you asked and you heard him chuckle "I don't mind, it's all yours to look at anyways, another plus to working out." Ryan said and you hummed just enjoying the view "Can I say something?" you asked "Of course." "Now, this is to be taken with no offense or anything, but…" you said before raising your foot to rest on his chest then continuing "I find you much more sexier." your action and words made Ryan finally look up to meet your eyes, so he gave you a raised brow "I'm not taking any offense, because that's what I was aiming for." Ryan said truthfully before taking hold of your foot, to bring it to his lips, to leave kisses behind as he made his way up to your calf "Really?" you asked surprised and he nodded before pulling on your foot to bring you closer to him "Yeah, I don't mind being cute, but I wanted to try something different." "Which is?" you asked bringing your arms to wrap around Ryan's neck as he placed you on his lap "Sexy." he stated but you give a confused expression "But you're already sexy." you said truthfully and Ryan shook his head "Yeah, but I want it to the point where you can't keep your hands off of me." he confused you even more "I'm confused babe, I thought I was already like that?" you asked trying to understand "You are.." Ryan started before sighing "It's hard to explain, don't worry about it." he told running his hand up and down your back while his other gripped your hip "You sure?" Ryan nodded kissing your lips before pulling away with a smile "I'm sure, but I am thankful you love the new look, but I'm not finished." you raised a brow at that "What do you mean you're not finished?" "This is my goal." he stated and you smiled at that "You're planning on getting finer than this?" and Ryan chuckled with a nod "Oh baby, what are you trying to do to me?" you said rubbing your hands along his shoulders and neck while Ryan brought both his has hands now to your hips, pulling you closer "Hopefully having you come undone as much times before the night is over." Ryan said hovering his lips over yours making you just want him more "Please." you begged before attaching your lips to his.

            "Are you hungry, cause I'm hungry." Ryan voiced as he entered the kitchen "I cooked dinner when I came home this evening." you said turning to the stove "But it's cold now." you said with a chuckle and Ryan raised his hands in defense "It's not my fault that I missed you." Ryan said smiling before coming over to you "You can sit and I'll heat it up." Ryan said gesturing to the island counter "You sure?" you asked and Ryan nodded kissing your forehead "I'm sure, don't want you exhorting yourself more than you should." Ryan commented making you smack his chest causing him to laugh "Sorry not sorry." Ryan said with a shrug and you just rolled your eyes while going to sit down. "So… I heard you're a firefighter now?" you questioned making Ryan go tense before looking towards you "I was hoping you won't hear about that." "Then don't go running into burning buildings." you said sternly and Ryan sighed before turning towards you "I'm sorry, but I was just thinking that someone could have been inside that needed rescuing." Ryan told you truthfully so now it was your turn to sigh "I get that and I understand, but after hearing what happened with Calleigh, I got scared okay, because that could have been you. I know you're made of steel cause clearly nothing takes you down but as your wife, I will still worry." you said standing now in front of Ryan "I know, and I'm sorry for worrying you, but it's who I am." you nodded cause you knew that "I know, and just so you know, it's who I am as well." Ryan raised a brow at that "Someone that runs into burning buildings?" he asked confused "Someone that puts their life on the line to help someone in need." you said with a smile and Ryan wasn't a fan of that but he chose not to say anything because he can't expect to live that way and ask you not to so instead he smiled at you  because at the end of the day, that's a good quality to have "Honestly I may hate it, you putting yourself in danger but it's not fair that I do it and then disagree when you do it." the words that left Ryan's mouth made you grin "Wow." you were at a loss for words because you expected Ryan to protest, like he always does "What?" he asked smiling down at you and you shrugged "I don't know, I didn't expect to get this far." you said truthfully and Ryan chuckled before planting a big kiss on your lips "Well, I love you and I won't stop you from being you because you won't stop me from being me." your eyes softened at that "I think my husband has been replaced while I was gone." you joked making Ryan scoff and roll his eyes "Leave me alone while I heat up dinner." Ryan said turning you around before smacking your bum and pushing you away from him "Go sit and look pretty." he commanded and you chuckled doing as told.
