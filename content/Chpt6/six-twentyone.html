            "Babe, have you seen my razor?" Ryan asked as he exited the bathroom "I may have used it yesterday?" you slowly said with a shy smile and Ryan sighed "I thought you had your own?" he questioned folding his arms as he watched you turn away from the closet "I do but we all know, men razors works so much better." "So what am I supposed to use then?" Ryan asked with a raised brow "Mine?" you asked nervously and Ryan reached up to pinch the bridge of his nose while closing his eyes "Then you do it" Ryan said after he opened back his eyes and you gave him a confused look "I do what?" you asked and he smile "Shave my face with one of your women razors." you were still confused "But why me?" "Because you used my razor and I know those razors you have nicks you, so if you shave me and I get nicked it would be by your hands not mine." Ryan said as you slowly walked over to him "That's wicked." you said and Ryan shrugged "You used my razor." he retorted back "And you trust me to do this?" you asked matching his stance, with your arms folded as well "Of course." Ryan said confidently and you just smiled at him with a shake of your head "You're evil you know that." you said heading off to the bathroom signaling for Ryan to follow you "Just being fair." Ryan commented and rolled your eyes.

            You were sitting on the counter as Ryan stood in front of you "Before I begin, are you absolutely sure about this?" you asked while pointing the razor in hand towards him and Ryan smiled with a nod "I am sure. I trust you." Ryan said making you sigh "The amount of faith you have in me." you said before beginning "Please keep steady and don't move." you warned him and Ryan replied with a nod while rest his hands on your thighs. With shaving cream on, you took a deep breathe before starting the shave. Keeping a steady head and focus you carefully moved making sure to not cut Ryan. Inside, Ryan was truly enjoying this and thinking about making you do this more often for him, it's just something about being pampered by you that feels nice and makes him all giddy inside. After taking your good time, you were finally finished. "Okay, all done." you said with an accomplished smile inspecting your work. Ryan chuckled before moving from in front of you to look in the mirror and inspected your work himself while touching his face. "So, did I do well Mr. Wolfe?" you asked pretty confidently and he nodded before looking at you with a grin "You did an amazing job beautiful. Maybe I should get you to shave my face for me more often." he said with a raised brow and you shook your head "Nope, that was nerve wrecking." you stated making Ryan chuckle "Well, you did a good job, thank you." Ryan said leaning forward to give you a kiss which you returned "You are very welcome."

            "Did you hear about the missing diamonds?" Dave asked as he worked on the surface computer behind you and you shook your head "The diamonds that were recovered?" you asked still focusing on the task before you "Yeah, I heard when Ryan and Walter went to check them out, they were gone." "Who was the last person to process them?" you asked curious "Your husband." that made you finally look away from your screen to look back at Dave "Wait, does that mean he's being held responsible?" you asked concern starting to take hold and Dave shook his head "He's good, they assumed someone came in and stole them, cause Ryan followed procedure when he handled them." Dave reassured and that made you release a breath you didn't know you were holding "That's the last thing he needs." you sighed then smiled before turning back to your screen deciding that you weren't going to focus back on your work until you see Ryan, so pulling out your phone, you decided to give him a call "This is Wolfe." you heard Ryan answered "Hey Wolfe, you at the lab?" you asked receiving a chuckle from him "Yeah, need something babe?" he asked pausing what he was doing "Yeah, can you meet me in the locker room in five?" "Yeah, I could do that." Ryan said hoping everything was okay.

            Ryan reached the locker room before you, so when you entered you saw he was sitting on a bench leaned over. "Hey." you announced as you entered making him look up towards you "Hey, everything okay?" he asked standing now as you walked over to him "I heard about what happened, with the diamonds, are you okay?" you asked with concerned laced in your voice and Ryan smiled at that "That's why you wanted to meet, I thought something was wrong." Ryan said feeling relieved but you gave him a look and apologized before answering your question "Yes baby, I am okay, was a bit panicked but I'm good now." Ryan said truthfully taking hold of your hands in his "Are you sure?" you asked just to be sure and Ryan nodded "Positive. Going to ask me next if I took them?" Ryan asked making you chuckle so you smacked his chest "Of course not, my husband isn't criminal." you commented and Ryan smiled down at you before kissing your forehead "Good. Now let me walk you back to your lab." Ryan said pulling you along with him "You know you don't have to." you stated towards him "I know but I want to." he said smiling down at you so you protested no longer and accepted the gesture.

            The shift was over and the diamonds were still missing but everyone knew that no one in the team was responsible for that. You and Natalia were walking and talking together as you both headed to the locker room "That does sound pretty tempting." you said as she told you about going out for drinks after the day you guys had. Entering you both heard Walter and Ryan caught up in their own conversation. They were talking about another co-worker making you guys laugh as you both opened your lockers. "So still no word on those diamonds?" Natalia asked looking towards Ryan and Walter "No. Gone. Thin air. Poof." Walter said looking up for dramatic effect "I'm telling you guys, heads are gonna roll on this one. I guarantee it." he continued while turning to his locker. After taking off his jacket and placing it in his locker Ryan turned towards everyone but mostly looking at you "I got an announcement to make." he started capturing everyone's attention "I'm not going out for a drink tonight, I'm too tired. I'm sick of this mission and I'm going home and taking my beautiful wife with me to take a bath." Ryan commented making you and Natalia chuckle "That's too bad because Natalia tempted me into going out with you guys for drinks." you said with a shrug "Yeah, and I'm going to get myself a tasty beverage as Crosby's" Natalia added helping you convince Ryan to come "I'm in." Ryan said instantly caving "Count me four." Walter said closer his locker and turning towards you guys "Is six a crowd?" came Calleigh's voice as she entered the room with Eric "Definitely not, this way we get to break the new guy in." Ryan joked taking hold of Eric and tapping his chest making Eric chuckle "New guy? How about the 'new' guy is buying." Eric stated with a laugh and a sound of approvals were heard from everyone. "You know what, I should probably make off. I'm so stupid." Natalia started making you all look towards her "What? What are you talking about, it was your idea." Walter asked trying to understand "Yeah, what happened?" you added cause she led a pretty convincing case into you tagging along "I know, but I forgot that I gotta be in court tomorrow morning and I even haven't gotten a chance to look at my notes. You know what, I'll have to catch up with you guys another night." Natalia said convincing everyone but you knew something was up "That's sad. Let's go." Calleigh said cheerily at the end smiling wide "Have one for me." she said as the rest started to leave "Have a nice night." Ryan told her as he left, you made sure to move slower than the rest to hang back a bit and you managed to see her and Eric share a look before she looked towards you "Everything okay?" you mouthed and she nodded her head with a smile and you were about ask something else but you heard Ryan calling for you "Heather, you coming?" Ryan asked as he stood by the door looking at you "Yeah, coming." you replied before giving Natalia a smile "Tomorrow." you said giving her a knowing look "Tomorrow." she replied back watching you leave. You met Ryan at the door as he threw a hand over your shoulder "What was that about?" he asked curious so you just shook your head "Not sure." you said honestly as you guys walked off to meet the rest.
