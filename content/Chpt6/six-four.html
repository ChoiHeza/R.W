            Both you and Ryan not to long arrived to work and were currently in the locker room. "Do you have to go to the office today?" Ryan asked closing his locker before turning to you "Yeah, but after my shift here." you said turning towards him as well "Ah, so that's why you said you'll be coming in late. I just thought you were hanging out with the girls after." Ryan said and you chuckled shaking your head "Sadly no." you said with a sigh and just that moment, Walter entered "If it isn't my sister from another mister." Walter greeted you making you smile wide "And is that my brother from another mother." he returned the smile and approached you and you both did your special shake, in the background Ryan just looked on super confused as to what is happening because one, he's never seen you act like this and two, how close were you with Walter to have a secret handshape. You both sensed Ryan stare on you "Hey man." Walter greeted towards Ryan with head nod and Ryan returned it and you just laughed at the interaction "Do you guys not know each other?" you asked pointing between the two and they nodded "We met couple days ago." Ryan said but he was more interested in the two of you "But you two, seem to really know each other." Ryan pointed out but not in a jealous kind of way "We met each other in the night shift, and since it's not that busy at night, we managed to get close." you said truthfully "I see, and the handshake?" he asked with a smile making you both chuckle "That's when a night was really really dead and we were both bored out of our minds and decided to make up a handshake." you said as you both laughed at the memory and Ryan couldn't help but smile seeing you easily getting along with others. Just as Ryan was about to reply both him and Walter got a message that they were needed at a crime scene, so they both bid you bye before leaving.

            You were currently in your lab when Walter spotted you from outside, so he immediately made a beeline for the entrance "Small bear." Walter greeted as he entered making you look towards him with a small "Big bear, what brings you here?" you asked as he made his way to you "Just saw you from outside and wanted to shout, what are you working on?" Walter asked as he looked on and you told him "Got lunch plans?" he asked and you shook your head "Well, now you do, remember the new Caribbean place that's supposed to open?" Walter asked and your face lit up "It's open?" you asked and Walter nodded "We gotta go there for lunch." "Then it's a date" Walter replied and at that moment Ryan entered catching the last part of your conversation "What's a date?" "Lunch, at the new Caribbean place that opened, want to tag along?" Walter asked him and Ryan smiled with a shake of his head "I wish I could, but my time is different." you both nodded "Okay, we'll bring you back something." you said looking towards Ryan "Okay, well, I will see you at lunch small bear." Walter said and you both high fived "You got it big bear." you called back to him as he left. So finally you turned towards Ryan but he managed to speak first "So many questions." he said making you chuckle "Let's start with what brought you here." Ryan chuckled at that "Okay, my sweater vest, what do you honestly think about it?" when Ryan asked that you looked at him with a grin on your lips wondering if he's serious "You're actually serious, that's what you came all this way to ask me?" and Ryan nodded seriously so you took a breath before replying "Honestly, I don't know how you do it knowing outside is hot but I love seeing you in your sweater vest, they make you look cute and comfy." you told him truthfully and Ryan sighed "What? Was that not the answer you wanted?" you asked confused "It's not a bad answer, it's just you're supposed to say that because you're my wife." Ryan said making you give him a deadpan look "Ryan Wolfe, you know that's not true, when you look awful, you know I tell when you do." you commented and Ryan nodded "That is true." so after hearing you say that Ryan decided to not let Jessie's comment bother him anymore. "So… you and Walter?" Ryan asked making you sigh "Not Walter too. First Dave now Walter. Babe, I promise it's nothing wrong between us. What we have is like between me and Eric, just sibling behaviour." you told him truthfully and Ryan waved his hands dismissing what you said "No, I can tell there's nothing going on there and I learnt my lesson from Dave, it's just weird." Ryan commented "Okay, well, let's talk after work and I will answer all the questions you have." you told him with smile which he returned "Thank you."

            You just got back from lunch was walking through the hallway when you spotted Ryan in a lab. So knocking the door you said "Hello hello." before entering making Ryan look your direction "Hey babe, what brings you here?" you made your way next to him "Just got back from lunch with Walter and decided to travel a path hoping to see you." you said with a grin making Ryan chuckle "Lunch was good?" you nodded "The food was delicious. I definitely have to take you there. I also got something for you and placed it in your locker." "Thanks babe." "No need to, so what are you doing, need help?" you asked looking over the books in front of Ryan "From you, always." Ryan said making you chuckle so he got into explaining what he was doing.

        <p class="story">
            Ryan and Jessie were in the locker room when you and Walter entered together, you all greeted each other. "I see there is no separating you two." Jessie commented on you and Walter entering together and you both chuckled "It's like having your best friend at work with you." Walter said and you agreed with a nod of your head "It really is." you both did a high five making Jessie laugh at you two "When you have a wife that gets along with everyone." Ryan commented with a chuckled, closer his locker turning to you and you sent a grin his way "I'm just a lovable person." you said matter of factly "You are. You guys want to hang out with Walter and I, we're going to grab something to eat?" Jessie asked both you and Ryan "Sorry, I have to head to the office, work still continues for me." you said speaking first and Jessie gave you a sorrowful look before turning to Ryan "Since she has work I'm free." Ryan said making you all chuckle. You closed your locker now with everything in hand and headed towards Ryan "Bring me home something?" you asked him and he nodded "Of course." he told you with a wide smile "Thank you." you returned his smile "Guys look away if you don't want to see me kiss my husband bye." you said grinning making them laugh "I gotta see it, still can't believe you're married to the guy." Walter commented making you chuckle so you turned to Ryan and quickly gave him a kiss which he returned "Believe now?" you asked Walter and he shrugged "The jury is still out." "Why don't you believe?" Jessie asked curious "When we head out I'll tell you guys." "This I got to here." Ryan said curious himself.
        </p>
        <p class="story">
            The guys went to a nearby food truck and were currently in the provided seated area. "Okay Walter, spill." Ryan asked referring to the comment he made in the locker room and Walter released a small laugh before starting "As humans we always automatically put faces to people when they’re mentioned not knowing what they looked like." Walter stated and the two others nodded before he continued "Well, automatically I imagined a black guy because Heather is black, and when she said he's bigger than her, I imagined someone bigger as well. This is no offense to you." Walter said gesturing towards Ryan and he shook his head "None taken, because I completely understand. It's like when I first introduced her to my family, they were expecting someone white, it happens." Ryan said understanding and not hurt in anyway at all "Yeah, I was just surprised, also finding out she's from the Caribbean, just gave me a completely different image of you." Jessie was intrigued by the Caribbean part "Is she!? Where?" Jessie asked "Barbados." Ryan answered and Jessie was surprised, honestly having no idea, he chuckled "I kind of thought she was from here, but now that you mentioned it you do hear a kind of an accent." Jessie said with some thought and Ryan nodded but Walter disagreed "What do you mean, you can kind of hear it, you can clearly hear it when she speaks." "I think we're talking about two different people." Ryan said and Walter shook his head "When you see Heather later, ask her about it." Ryan took note of that and will definitely ask you about it "But that's cool though, that she's from Barbados." Ryan agreed "Yeah, we actually met the first week she got here." Jessie's eyes widened at that "Really!?" Ryan nodded and Walter laughed cause he knew the story "I assume you know the story?" Ryan asked Walter and he nodded "Now I got to hear this." Jessie said and Ryan grinned getting into it.
        </p>
        <p class="story">
            "It sounds like fate." Jessie said in awe "Because what were the chances that the same thing happening again and you just happened to be in the area. And even then if you guys didn't meet there, she works at the lab, you guys would have met eventually." Jessie commented and that made Walter grin "Look at you dimples, having a soft spot." Ryan laughed at the nickname that Walter gave him "If anything, I would think that it's you Walter with the soft spot, you called Jessie dimples." "Not me." Walter said defending himself "It’s Heather, she calls me dimples." now Ryan was amazed "So wait, you're dimples and Walter is big bear." Ryan said making Jessie laugh "Big bear?" he asked and Walter nodded proudly "And I gladly accepted that name." both Ryan and Jessie laughed at that. They just joked around more, laughed and talk.

        <p class="story">
            "Hey baby, I'm home." you said coming in through the door "Kitchen." you heard Ryan called out, so you quickly took off your shoes and headed his way "Hey you." you said with a grin when he came into view and you rest down your bags before heading over to him "Hey beautiful." he said as he took you into his embrace, arms wounding tightly around your waist, so you brought your hands to capture his face to give him a deep kiss "I needed this." you said smiling up at him "Tired?" Ryan asked and you nodded "Extremely. Did you remember to buy me something to eat?" you asked and Ryan nodded "Of course, it's in the microwave, want me heat it up?" "Yes sir. I'll go shower." you said giving him one more kiss before stepping out his arms, and heading towards the bathroom.
        </p>
        <p class="story">
            After Ryan set the timer, he left the kitchen and headed to the bedroom, he found you undressing for your shower, so he stopped in the doorway and leaned against the frame "Just came to watch me?" you asked not even looking Ryan's direction cause you could feel his stare "Not necessarily, there's something I wanted to ask you." you looked towards him now "Sure, what is it?" "While I was out with the guys, Jessie was surprised to find out that you weren't from here and Walter made a comment that it's not hard to tell based on how you talk." Ryan asked curious "And what do you think?" you asked heading to the bathroom and Ryan followed "What do you mean?" "How I talk, does it sound like I'm from here?" you asked turning on the shower "Well, you can pass on how you speak." Ryan said truthfully "But I don't understand what Walter meant when he said that and he told me to ask you." Ryan said confused as you stepped into the shower after stepping out your undergarments "I know what he meant." you said and Ryan waited for you reply but nothing came so Ryan chuckled before asking "Not going to explain?" you chuckled yourself "When I get out I'll tell you."
        </p>
        <p class="story">
            You existed the bathroom, towel around your body and spotted Ryan on the bed patiently waiting for you and you chuckled "Waited for me?" and he nodded with a smile so you just shook your head smiling, heading over to the dresser "So what did Walter mean?" Ryan asked right off the bat "Okay, when we first met, how did I sound?" you asked him seriously and Ryan thought for a moment before replying "Normal, American. I couldn't tell you weren't from here, until you told me." you nodded "That's because that's how I wanted to come across towards you." you said and Ryan gave you a puzzled look so you chuckled "Okay, us Caribbean black people, when we met Americans or white people, we speak differently, or in a way that you can understand us. It's kind of like code switching, how I talk with a black person, wouldn't be the same way I talk with a white person. It just happens out of habit." Ryan was understanding now but still lost "Okay, so then what did Walter meant when he said he could clearly tell, you aren't from here, based on how you speak?" you were fully dressed now and moved to the bed to sit next to Ryan "Because I talked normal when I first met him or when we're together." Ryan was confused again so you chuckled "My mind registered another black person, so without thinking, I talked as how I would back in Barbados, and immediately he knew I wasn't from here." the look of realization crossed his face but there was still a hint of confusion "So wait. How do you talk to me then?" Ryan asked and you gave a shy smile and that answered his question "It just happens out of habit, it's not purposely done. I've always talked in a way that you would understand, because at the end of the day you were a white guy that I met." Ryan looked almost hurt "So basically I'm no different than everyone else you to talk to beside Walter?" so you sighed "Ryan, it wasn't purposely done, it just happens, and I didn't think too much behind it, and I just remained talking that way to you than I would with another Bajan." Ryan was fully hurt now "Why not, I'm your husband and we've been together for six - seven years now." you sighed and shrugged "Honestly, I don't know why either, it just stuck. I'm sorry." you said lowering your head "I'm not mad, I'm just hurt. It's like Walter gets to see a part of you that I never got to see before and it kind of sucks. It's he gets the real you, while I'm stuck with the fake one" Ryan said truthfully bringing his hand to raise your face to look at him "Okay, I guess going forward with you, I should speak how I would normally." you told him and that brought a smile to his face "And this would be the normal you, the original you?" Ryan asked excitement slowly over taking his face making you giggle "Yes." "Okay, say something." Ryan asked immediately putting you on the spot making you blush "It’s not that easy, because I got so accustom talking to you in a certain way." Ryan sulked so you smiled "Okay okay. I'll introduce myself and tell you a little about me as if I'm meeting you for the first time, and speak in Bajan." So that's what you did, you spoke as if you would back home and Ryan was in awe because it was like seeing something new from you but it wasn't new, it was just you being you. The smile would not leave Ryan's face and that just made you more shy and blushed more. "Stop hiding your face, I love it, and I can't believe you never talked to me normal but had to hide yourself." Ryan said removing your hands from your face "I guess I mostly did it so you could understand me." "You're back to speaking fake again." Ryan commented and you sighed "Sorry, it's a habit." "Is it because I'm white?" Ryan asked truthfully and you shook your head "No, It's just habit, but I will try my best, to speak normal around you." you said switching back to your normal voice and the smile returned on Ryan's face "I love it. The way you speak and say words, it's different but it's beautiful and honestly it suits you better than that fake accent you've been giving me all these years." Ryan said scolding you at the end "I'm sorry, it won't happen again. I promise." you said feeling more confident speaking your dialect around him "It's weird." Ryan commented "What is?" "Hearing you speak in your normal voice." you frowned and Ryan quickly dismiss your thoughts "It's not a bad weird, don't worry, I love it and you sound very beautiful." that cause a smile to appear on your face "Thank you Ryan, for understanding." you brought your hands up to wrap around his neck and something flashed across his eyes "Say it again, say my name again." you gave a confused look but complied none the less "Ryan." you saw him close his eyes as he took in what you just said "Everything okay baby?" you asked concerned now "No it's not, because you've been holding out on me with that beautiful accent of yours saying my name. I think that has just became my new favourite sound." Ryan said making you chuckle and smack his chest "Boy, I thought something was wrong." you said in full on Bajan, not hiding anymore and Ryan gave you a look, one that you knew all too well "Right there." you said pointing at his face "That's why I didn't speak my dialect, you didn't understand anything I just said." Ryan gave a sorry "Sorry, but that doesn't mean to go back to the fake voice, I just have to get accustom to this one." he said so you nodded "I guess I can ease you into it slowly." you told him and Ryan immediately disagreed shaking his head "No, be you, no more altering or hiding around me, I want you so I have to get accustom and I will. Got it?" Ryan said sternly so you nodded "Yes sir." you said with a giggle at the end "Good girl." he said then pecked your lips "I'm hungry." you commented making Ryan laugh "So out of the blue but okay, the food should still be warm." "Thank you baby, you're a doll." you said kissing his cheek before getting up and Ryan followed suit "I love how you say baby." Ryan confessed making you grin, cause everything that comes out of your mouth going forward Ryan is just going to fall in love with.
