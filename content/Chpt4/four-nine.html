            It was your day off today, so you made sure to get some home chores completed today and you were currently on the sofa with a book in hand waiting till Ryan come home. Dinner was cooked, apartment was cleaned and laundry was washed all that was needed now was your husband. He already called and said he was leaving work and asked if you needed anything, you told him ice cream. "Hey beautiful, I'm home." you heard Ryan said coming in through the door, "Hi baby, living room." Ryan took off his shoes and headed to the kitchen first to rest down the ice cream before heading to you "Hey." he said entering the living room, and giving you a kiss before plopping down onto the sofa next to you. "Had a good day?" you asked resting down your book, giving Ryan your attention "It was eventful, I really missed you today. After getting so accustom seeing you there, felt weird entering the lab and you weren't there." you chuckled at that going closer to his side "Aw, who would of thought that a day like that would of come." "I know right, but other than that, today's case wasn't bad." Ryan got into explain the situation with Calleigh and how it tied into the case "So she never actually saw them?" Ryan shook his head "She didn't." "So, if they never went after her, they probably would of gotten away with the murder?" you asked and Ryan nodded "But, I guess they didn’t want to take any chance and that was their downfall while being our fortune." you smiled at that "I guess it work out well, minus the Calleigh part, but you got them." you took Ryan's hand in yours before continuing "But the really messed up part was selling the drugs to kids." Ryan was currently leaning back against the sofa with his head looking towards the ceiling and you decided to match his position, but on your side instead and head looking towards Ryan. You felt him squeezed your hand after your statement "It is also scary if you think about it. Imagine if we had children, we won't know what they're doing at school." that made you sigh "I guess it's a good thing we aren’t having them just yet." you stated and Ryan turned his head to look at you "When do you think would be the best time for us?" Ryan asked seriously "Well, first you have to pay off your debt cause children aren't cheap, then we would have to get a house, and I would have to be more available cause we're both very busy, and I don't want my children being raised by nannies." Ryan listened on "But, we can have kids anytime, I just want when we have them, we're able to properly take care of them and be the parents they deserve." you said with a smile thinking about the thought and Ryan just looked at you with love "I agree. When things are more settled between us, then we could seriously talk about having children." Ryan said returning your smile. He reached forward and took hold of your waist pulling you closer to straddle his lap "And how was your day?" Ryan asked as you settled to lay on him head going on his shoulder as he wrapped his arms around you pulling you close getting comfortable "It was busy, cleaned, washed and cooked." "No work?" you shook your head "Nah, decided to take an actual off day, so that laptop has not seen my face for the day." you chuckled and Ryan started rubbing your back up and down "Thank you baby." "For what?" you asked "Just being you, an amazing wife." you leaned up making Ryan look at you "I'm just doing what needs to be done." Ryan rolled his eyes "Babe, just take the compliment." you laughed "Okay okay." Ryan leaned up smiling and placed a sweet kiss on your lips "Thank you." he said raising a brow "Always." then he smiled satisfied at your reply, so he pecked your lips once more before leaning back bringing you with him "Aren't you hungry?" you asked "Nah, not as yet. I just want to lay like this for a while, if you don't mind." "I don't mind, take all the time you need." you smiled getting comfy. "Thank you, cause I really missed you today." you chuckled "Obsessed much." Ryan laughed as well "I'm not even going to deny it. I am obsessed with my wife." "Aren't I am a lucky one." you turned to kiss his chin before laying back in your position and you felt his hold tighten on you filled with so much love.

            You chuckled feeling and hearing his stomach grumbled "I guess you're finally hungry now." it's been almost thirty minutes that you guys were laying like this "No, ignore it. I don’t want to move just yet." Ryan said causing you to chuckle "Okay sir, if you can ignore it." five minutes didn't even pass before Ryan caved cause you heard him groan "Okay, I got to eat." he said causing you to lean up and look down at him "I'll heat it up for you and you can shower in the meantime." Ryan nodded "Sounds perfect." he gave you a kiss before you got up, but he took hold your hand halting you as he stood up himself "What?" you asked looking at him but he just captured your face with his free hand and leaned in giving you a very tender kiss. When you pulled away, you had to ask "What was that for?" Ryan just shrugged starting to walk away "Just felt like it." you chuckled "Very weird you are Mr. Wolfe." you said heading the opposite direction "You know you love it Mrs. Wolfe." he said before disappearing to the bedroom making you giggle. Well he was not wrong. With that you headed into the kitchen to heat up dinner.
