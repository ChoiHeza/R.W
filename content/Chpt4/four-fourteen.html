        "Hey" you said with a knock, alerting Eric of your presence before entering the lab 
        "Hey, did you have any luck?" he asked referring to the information you
        had to find out for him "I was more than successful." you said has you
        passed off the tablet to him so he could see. You discussed what was
        there, explaining it to him "This is exactly what I was looking for,
        thanks Heather." Eric said looking up at you with a smile while handing
        back the tablet "Anytime." you returned his smile, but before leaving
        there was something you wanted to ask him about, so looking around to
        make sure no one was near, you stepped closer to him and he caught on
        "What is it?" he asked "You were smiling pretty widely before I entered
        the lab, and I know that smile." Eric thought back and the smile
        returned so you pointed out "There it is, and if I had to guess,
        Calleigh is the reason behind that smile." you stated, so Eric looked
        around once again to make sure the coast was still clear "You're good. I
        saw Calleigh in a wedding veil." Eric said, smile growing and you had to
        quickly contain yourself before you squealed out "I bet you fell in love
        didn't you?" you said matching his smile and he just shrugged "Not a
        word." so you made the gesture of sealing your lips "I don't even know
        what we're talking about." you said with a wink causing Eric to chuckle
        and at that very moment you both saw Natalia coming towards the lab "I
        take that as my cue to leave." you said so no suspicions are risen and
        Eric nodded "We'll talk later." "You got it." with that you left and
        greeted Natalia as you passed her.

        You entered back your lab and saw Ryan was there working on the second
        surface computer "Hello hello." you said catching his attention causing
        him to turn to you with a smile "Hey beautiful, where are you now coming
        from?" he asked pausing watching your movements "From by Eric." you said
        resting down the tablet by your computer before coming to stand next to
        him "He wanted info on something. Need any help?" you asked "If it's you
        offering, always." Ryan said with a grin causing you to chuckle "You
        don't stop, do you?" Ryan shook his head "Never." you just rolled your
        eyes, smile never leaving your lips "So what are we doing?" you asked
        turning to the screen and Ryan explained "So the wife wasn't the
        intended target?" you asked "We don't think she was, but we want to back
        up that theory by finding the actual target." you nodded understanding
        "Okay then, let's get to work." with that you both started rearranging
        the photos that was taken by photographers, to recreate the sitting
        arrangements of the guests "You know, you're really good with the surface
        computer." you commented on how efficiently Ryan works with the device
        "Well, I did had an amazing teacher, and I may have gotten extra
        learning for it." you laughed at that "We both know you never needed
        those extra lessons." you said and Ryan chuckled nervously "Sue me for
        wanting an excuse to spend time with my wife at work." you smiled "Like
        you don't have enough time already with me at home." "But if you're here
        at work, why not try to take advantage of that as well." Ryan said
        causing you to chuckle "Okay okay." "Okay, the guests are seated, let's
        find the target." Ryan said and it was time for your expertise to shine.
        At that moment Horatio entered the lab "Mr. and Mrs. Wolfe, what do you
        have for me?" "So Calleigh and Delko found the target seat." Ryan said
        "But do we have the guest's name yet?" H asked looking on "Well, event
        security gave me access to the guest information, so this should give us
        a list of the guest names. That's what we're doing now, finding out
        who was the target." Ryan said as you continued to type away but it wasn't long before a
        name popped up "The target was Kelly Chapman." you said reading off the
        name "She's a dancer at the club." Ryan stated "Yes, she was, and she
        was the intended victim. We need to find her." H said and with that he
        was gone. "Got to get a location." Ryan told you "On it." you got to
        searching and it wasn't long before her address was shown "There we go."
        you said and Ryan pulled out his phone ready to call Horatio "Thank you
        baby." he said with a wink "Anytime." he tapped your lower back before
        leaving with the phone to his ear.

        You and Eric were in the locker room talking when the others entered
        "Why is it, that it's always you two having conversations together in
        the locker room?" Natalia stated, making both you and Eric aware of
        their presence. Eric was the first to speak "What do you mean?" "Either
        you guys are here first together or you arrive later together, what's
        that about?" Natalia asked pointing to the two of you so you shrugged
        "I'm not sure. I guess out of all you guys, I'm closest to Eric and I've
        known him longer." you said so they won't pick up that you guys discuss
        other things, especially a certain someone. "Yeah, plus Heather is super
        chill." Natalia nodded not really buying it so she turned to look at
        Ryan "You approve of this?" she asked him and he raised his hands in a
        defense position "Don't put me in this, that's between them." Ryan
        chuckled turning to his locker. "I just find it suspicious." she said
        giving up and both you and Eric laughed "Well, Eric was the first person
        to meet Heather years ago and I know they've hung out a couple times
        when he was with Ryan." Calleigh stated before shrugging "So I don't
        think it's suspicious." You guys chatted some more before leaving.

        Not feeling like going home to cook, Ryan decided to take you out for
        some food. So you guys went to the food truck central, buying your
        favourites' before sitting in the eating area that was provided. "You
        know what I really love?" Ryan asked after resting down his fork "What
        is that?" you asked still eating your food "Working with you, like today
        for example. I think we make an excellent team." Ryan said smiling
        towards you "I agree. It was really nice." you returned the smile "So…"
        Ryan said dragging it out, so you raised a brow for him to continue "You
        and Eric." he said and that made you smile "What about me and Eric, I
        thought you weren't getting involved?" you stopped eating to look at
        Ryan "I'm not, I've just been thinking about what Natalia said, and was
        just beginning to get curious about your relationship with him, that's
        all." you reached out a hand towards Ryan for him to take "So what are
        you thinking exactly, that I'm having an affair with him?" Ryan chuckled
        shaking his head "No, I didn’t think that, because I trust you, I was
        just curious to what secrets you guys have." you smiled "Well, they're
        not mine to share. You know Eric confides in me, the relationship we
        have are like siblings, and I guess since he's lost his sister, I've
        been like that for him." you said with a sad smile and Ryan understood
        "Well, I am thankful he has someone he can turn too, and plus since
        you've entered his life, he's been off my back." Ryan said laughing at
        the last part "You're welcome. But on a serious note, I don't want you
        to feel like I'm cheating on you or anything, but if you ever get that
        feeling, let me know." Ryan nodded "I understand, and I'm not worried
        about you two. I trust you both with my life." that made your heart
        swell and a wide smile to graced your face "Really?" Ryan nodded
        "Really. I meant every word." that caused you to lean across the table
        to give a peck to his lips "That really means a lot." you said sitting
        back and Ryan squeezed your hand "But don't tell Delko that I said
        that." Ryan warned and you made the action of sealing your lips "Your
        secret is safe with me." that caused Ryan to chuckle "Thank you." he
        said before going back to eating "Always." you smiled resuming eating as
        well.
