        Today is supposed to be a good day because one, Ryan will be reinstated
        and two, you guys will get to see each at work. Ryan left before you
        that morning to make sure he got everything in order before starting
        back and you promised to meet him there. Ryan was super excited all
        morning and just couldn't believe his luck. You saw him left this
        morning in a white jacket, green shirt and jeans, so you decided to
        match with him. Why not be one of those couples that work together and
        match their outfits, so you decided to wear the same shade green shirt
        along with a white skirt and heels. Leaving home and arriving to the lab
        you were looking forward to seeing Ryan but something came up that
        required you to go back to the office for a moment, meaning that you
        won't get to see him after he got reinstated but only later.
      </p>

      <p class="story">
        While on the ground floor, Ryan decided to make his first stop by Alexx,
        sharing the good news that he's back but was met with a surprise to find
        her passed out on the floor, so wasting no time he called for medical
        help to get her transported. That was not how he wanted to start his
        first day back and just hoped she was okay. So staying with her till
        help arrived and he then went up to his floor to get caught up on the
        current case, and was told to retrieve some information about one of the
        victims and he had to go to the tech lab for it so a smile grew on his
        face because he finally got to see you at work. He entered the lab and
        saw the new equipment "Wow. That's a nice upgrade." he said until he
        realized it wasn't you there but another new girl "The, uh, hardware, I
        meant." he said trying to make himself seemed less like a creep, because
        he intentionally meant that for you and not her at all but she did
        smile. So not wanting to seem like a creep, he started over by
        introducing himself "I'm sorry, I'm Ryan Wolfe and I just got
        reinstated." he said hand out stretched which she shook "I know who you
        are, Samantha." she introduced herself back "Where’s Heather, I thought
        she was working in this lab?" Ryan asked because this is where you told
        him you would be "She is, but something came up at her office so he had
        to disappear for a bit, so I'm just filling in till she returns." Ryan
        nodded a bit bummed but he'll just have to see you later, so he didn’t
        waste any more time and got into working the case "So, this is Diana
        Long's desktop computer?" he asked referring to what Samantha had
        displayed on the screen "More like her lifeline. There's an icon for
        absolutely everything." Samantha replied back so Ryan folded his arms
        and looked on "Well, it's modern living I guess." "If you call being a
        mouse potato living, sure, I guess so." "Says the girl who gets her
        paycheck from standing in front a computer screen all day." Ryan
        remarked towards her and she smiled "Wow, first day back and you're
        already feisty. Would you tell your wife that knowing she does the same
        thing?" Samantha stated back and Ryan chuckled "I would, but then she
        would make a comeback on how she makes more money than me." they both
        chuckled at that "I knew I liked her for a reason." Samantha said
        smiling to herself then they went back to discussing the case.

        Ryan made sure to go back and look for Alexx the moment he heard she was
        back "Whoa. Hey, look who's back." Ryan said entering the morgue going
        over to her with a wide smile "There's my hero. Did you have a nice
        homecoming, baby?" Alexx was all smiles upon seeing him "Hey, I don’t
        want to talk about that. You know what I want to talk about? What
        happened to you?" he asked referring to how he came in and found her and
        she got to explaining, that it was the dead guy on her table. After they
        talked some more and Ryan got the evidence that Alexx retrieved he was
        about to leave but Alexx halted him "Wait, how was it seeing your wife
        working in the lab?" Alexx asked wide smiled and Ryan sighed "I haven't
        managed to see Heather as yet. She had to go back to the office but I
        should get to see her soon hopefully." "Happy?" Alexx asked and Ryan
        smiled "Happy and proud." he replied before leaving to hand off the
        evidence from Alexx.

        As the day went on, Ryan heard you were back in the lab so he quickly
        made his way to you, smile not leaving his face. There came a knock on
        the glass door that made you look towards the source "If it isn't CSI
        Wolfe, back out to duty." you said with a wide grin of your own as Ryan
        entered the room "I came by this morning looking forward to be working
        on a case with my wife but instead I accidently hit on the new girl."
        you raised a brow "I made a comment while entering the lab without
        realizing it wasn't you." you chuckled "Poor Samantha." you said turning
        back to the screen "So, do you like?" "Which are you referring to, the
        woman I love in front the screens working or the upgrade?" Ryan asked
        making you laugh and shake your head "I was referring to the latter." "I
        do love both actually." you smacked his hand "Be serious Ryan, what do
        you think about it?" "I was actually really impressed when I saw
        Samantha worked on it this morning, and I just kept thinking, wow, my
        wife built this. Couldn’t wrap my head around it honestly." that made
        you feel good and proud "Thank you, hard work pays off." you said
        throwing a smile towards him. "Well done babe. So I was told that I have
        to receive training on it." you nodded "Yes sir, every CSI has to. So
        that's what you're here for?" Ryan nodded "That and seeing your gorgeous
        face." Ryan said smirking "You need to behave, we're at work." "I'll try
        my best but you know that's not going to be easy." "Well try harder CSI
        Wolfe." Ryan nodded smiling "I will Mrs. Wolfe. Your student is ready to
        learn." chuckling you got to work.
      </p>

      <p class="story">
        You were currently putting together multiple photos that the CSIs took
        from different angles. When Horatio's voice sounded from behind you
        "Mrs. Wolfe" "Well, we know our killer may have been spying on his victims.
        I've taken all the photos from the three crime scenes and created
        panoramic views of the outside environments." H listened on as he moved
        closer to you "And it stands to reason if the killer could see his
        victims, it's possible they could see him." "Yes, because of line of
        sight." you explained more while arranging the photos and trying out
        different views. Then you found the point of interest and gave the
        address to H "Thank you Heather." H said before leaving.
      </p>

      <p class="story">
        Your shift was over and you were in the locker room currently talking
        with Eric "It's not your fault Eric, Settler just have his way with
        messing with you guys." "I know, but if I didn't say anything, they
        wouldn’t have a falling out and Calleigh wouldn’t be mad at me." you
        chuckled at that "Eric, hun, Calleigh could never be mad at you over
        something like this, trust me." Eric offered you a smile so you leaned
        in closer to whisper "But just between us, I think it's for the best."
        you said with a wink before standing back and you and Eric shared a
        knowing smile "Thanks Heather." "Always." Ryan entered the locker at the
        same time catching you and Eric talking "What you guys talking about?"
        Ryan asked coming over to you "Just work." you replied to Ryan so Eric
        turned to you "Tomorrow guys, there's somewhere I have to be. Once
        again, welcome back Wolfe." Eric told you both and threw a knowing nod
        your way which you returned and gave Ryan a bro hug "Tomorrow." you
        replied back with a nod of your own and Ryan gave his own reply after
        the hug. After Eric left Ryan turned to you "What was that about?" Ryan
        asked "What do you mean?" you asked retrieving your handbag from the
        locker "Between you and Eric." "Oh, was nothing serious, just work
        related and stuff about Settler." Ryan nodded "So you ready to go?" you
        asked turning to him "That's what I came to talk with you about, I have
        to meet with H, so you can go on without me, and I'll meet you at home."
        "Okay, not in trouble right?" you smiled and Ryan chuckled "Nah,
        probably just wanted to talk to me about coming back." "Okay, I'll see
        you at home then." Ryan leaned forward and placed a kiss to your
        forehead before you both left the locker room going opposite directions.

      <p class="story">
        You guys had a lot to celebrate so Ryan made dinner reservations that
        night to one of you guys' favourite restaurant. Getting home before Ryan gave you
        more time to get ready because you usually take longer than him. So when
        Ryan came in, he saw that you were now finishing your hair. He greeted
        you quickly with a kiss before disappearing to the bathroom "Your
        clothes are already ironed." you told him before he entered "Thanks
        babe." taking your dress from the hanger, you slipped it onto your body.
        It was a white silk shape dress, layered scoop at the neck with gathers
        and the back was exposed. It was a dress you bought recently and was
        super excited to wear it because the moment you tried it on in the store
        you fell in love. While putting on your earrings Ryan emerged from the
        bathroom "Whoa." Ryan stopped in his tracks "Look at you." you smiled
        turning towards him after doing a spin "You like?" "I love." you
        chuckled "Thank you. As much as I love you checking me out, you have to
        get ready so we won't be late." "That's not going to be easy." "Then I
        will make it easy for you." you said picking up the remainder of your
        things needed to get ready before heading off to the bathroom. "Dress,
        hurry." you said pointing a finger at him before closing the door. Ryan
        wasted no time in getting ready. He sat on the bed and waited till you
        came out. "Need help with your shoes?" Ryan asked as he saw you walked
        out "Yes please." you said heading over retrieving the silver heals
        you're going to wear, so with them in hand you walked over to Ryan and
        gave them to him. Taking the shoes from you he rested them down, and
        asked for your left foot first, so resting a hand on his shoulder, you
        lifted the foot as he clasped it on and he did the same for the right.
        "All finished." he said after he clasped the last one. He glided his
        hand up the back of your calf to your thigh coming to rest on your hip
        before standing up "You can't help yourself can you." you said smiling
        up at him and he shook his head with a smirk "Why would I when you look
        this sexy." he leaned down and placed a kiss to your cheek not wanting
        to ruin your lipstick. You then walked over to the mirror to check out
        the full outfit. "Definitely a favourite." you said turning looking at
        the back "I was thinking the same exact thing." Ryan said while leaning
        back watching you. You looked towards him in the mirror and saw the look
        he was giving you "Don't give me that look." "What look?" Ryan asked but
        he knew what you meant "You know, the look where you undress me with
        your eyes and imagine all the things you want to do with me." you said
        with a raised brow and Ryan shrugged "Maybe." you shook your head "Let's
        go before that becomes a reality." you moved towards him and reached out
        for his hand to take "But would that be so bad though." you chuckled as he
        stood up capturing your waist in his hold "It wouldn't but we have
        plans." you sternly told him, and he sighed before kissing your forehead
        "Okay let's hurry and leave because you're seriously turning me on right
        now." you chuckled starting to pull him along with you to leave but he
        pulled behind "What's wrong?" "Nothing, I just want to walk behind and
        watch you walk." that made you laugh "Pervert." you said but continued
        walking giving Ryan the view he asked for.
