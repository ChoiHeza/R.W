        "The fact that I can leave home for work, and go there and still see my
        wife, I must have to be the luckiest guy ever." Ryan said as he was
        getting dressed and you laughed "Is that sarcasm Ryan Wolfe?" you asked
        as you were getting dressed yourself "Of course not, what made you think
        that?" you shrugged "I just figured most guys love to get away from
        their wives during the day." "Well then I guess I am not most guys.
        Cause I do love to see my wife during my day, makes it so much better."
        that made you smile "Well I love seeing you too." you finished dress
        then turned to Ryan "What do you think?" you wore a white, orange and
        navy blue dress and Ryan looked you over "I love it. See now, this is
        another plus to working together, we get to match and be that couple."
        Ryan said approaching you and you just smile "And this makes you happy?"
        Ryan nodded "Very happy" his hands took hold of your waist "Well it is
        fun matching with you." you said running your hands along the front of
        his orange sweater covered chest "Going to wear the jacket?" Ryan nodded
        looking down at you, smile not leaving his face "What?" you asked "I
        just love you." that made your smile widen "And I love you." you said
        and that made him leaned down to capture your lips.

        "Have a good day today Mrs. Wolfe." Ryan said as he approached you
        coming from his locker "And you too Mr. Wolf." you guys shared a smile
        and you blew a kiss his way making him chuckle "Thanks baby, you know
        I'm going to see you throughout the day." "I know, get going." "Yes
        mam." Ryan quickly kissed your cheek before leaving and you turned back
        to your locker, before getting a start on your working day.

      <p class="story">
        There was an explosion that was triggered by a bomb, so your assistance
        was required "Mrs. Wolfe." you heard your husband call your name as he
        entered the lab, so turning you saw Calleigh also followed in close
        behind him with a smile on her face "Hey." she greeted "Hey guys, how
        may I be of service?" Ryan held up a sim card before you "This sim was
        recovered from the bomb that went off and we wanted to know who
        triggered it." "Okay." you said looking at the sim "And you're the smart
        one, so that's where you come in." Calleigh said making you smile "You
        got it." taking the sim from Ryan you looked at it "Well, you know, it
        doesn't look too damaged." he made a comment as you inspected it and you
        nodded "So it should tell us for sure what we need to know." you said as
        you placed down the sim on the surface computer, then was about to get
        started but you got a call "It is H, I have to take this." you said
        before starting to leave "Continue without me." you said before
        answering the phone and stepping out the lab, so Calleigh turned to Ryan
        "I guess it's me then." he stated getting started by pulling up the call
        log looking for the last number the phone received "Okay, that's the
        number of the caller that detonated the bomb. Can you try reverse phone
        directory?" Calleigh asked Ryan "Sure." he replied doing just that "You
        picked up the surface computing quickly." Calleigh commented making Ryan
        smile "Wasn't that hard. Heather is an amazing teacher and she caught me
        up to speed." Ryan said nonchalantly and that made Calleigh smile
        because she caught on "So you were just using it as an excuse to spend
        more time with Heather?" she asked smiling wide looking at Ryan "Yeah,
        she, she, uh, saw through it too, because she knows I'm a quick learner
        and I already had a grasp of it from the first day, but she just
        entertained me." Ryan said shyly trying to hide his smile "Okay, there's
        no name attached to the cell phone. This is a prepaid cell." Ryan said
        getting the info "What about the service provider?" Calleigh asked and
        Ryan got it "Yeah. Service provider is FlorCom Mobile." "Can you use
        that to get me a location on the call?" Calleigh asked writing down the
        name "I can't get you the location but I can get you the nearest cell
        tower." Ryan replied looking for said tower "The call originated from a
        cell tower at Tamiami Trail and Kenwood. Not a lot of civilization out
        there. That's the Everglades." Ryan said looking at the map on the
        screen "That's where the Miami-Dade Department of Detention is located."
        Calleigh said before looking towards Ryan "Call came from inside the
        building." she continued and just that moment you entered back the lab
        "Sorry about that, everything went well?" you said coming to stand next
        to Ryan "Yes mam, Ryan here is an expert already." Calleigh said smiling
        widely making Ryan scratch the back of his neck "He is a quick learner."
        you said sending a wink his way before turning back to Calleigh "I've
        heard." she chuckled and you caught on joining.

        Natalia came and dropped off a box of CDs for Ryan to watch. It was
        surveillance footage and hours of it. Ryan sensed that this was payback
        from when he set her up, and just when he thought that she was going to
        watch with him, he saw her starting to walk away "Hey, where are you
        going?" he asked so she turned back quick to reply "I got it, you watch
        it." she said before walking away completely now and Ryan sighed turning
        back to the box before him. So taking the tapes he went to the video lab
        and got started on watching the tapes. Just then you were passing by,
        you managed to catch a glimpse of Ryan, so knocking you entered the lab.
        "Hey." Ryan greeted when he saw you coming in "Hey babe, what are you
        doing?" you asked going to stand beside him "Natalia gave me a box of
        CDs, worth hours of surveillance footage that I have to watch." "Yikes,
        sounds like punishment." you chuckled "I think it is." you thought for a
        moment "Is it for when you were working for the defense?" you asked
        resting a hand on his shoulder "That's my guess as well." Ryan replied
        not taking his eyes from the screen, so you pulled up a chair and sat
        next to him "What are you doing?" Ryan asked pausing the video looking
        towards you "Let me help, I just started my lunch break." Ryan's face
        soften at your request "You know you don't have to, it's my burden to
        bare." you chuckled reaching for a CD "Well, I am your wife, so that
        makes it my burden as well." you rolled over to the next screen and
        inserted the CD before looking back at him "Plus two set of eyes are
        better than one. So what are we looking for?" you asked and Ryan just
        couldn't believe how amazing you were and a permanent smile was etched
        on his face "Thank you." he said making you smile as well "Always." then
        he told you what to find and you guys got started on watching the
        footage. A good amount of time went by before you saw something "Hey
        Ryan, look at this." you said catching his attention, so he paused his
        video and rolled over to you "Show me." you hit play and you both
        watched "You think this might be important?" you asked as you watched
        the son clearly being a pedophile "I'm not sure, but I'll make note of
        it." Ryan said before going back to his screen and you marked the
        section before continuing. A little more time passed before you got a
        message that you were needed "I got to go." you said pausing the video
        turning to Ryan "Okay babe, thank you so much." he reached out for your
        hand which you took as you stood up and squeezed it "Sorry, I couldn't
        help more." Ryan shook his head smiling "Your help has been perfect, and
        greatly appreciated." you smiled at that "You're welcome, let me know
        how it goes, you know where to find me." Ryan nodded before you said
        your byes and left.

        About twenty minutes passed before Natalia entered the room where Ryan
        was, they both greeted each other and she took the seat that you were
        in. "You know, I've been through every hour of this surveillance video,
        and I haven't found anything that suggests that Scott LeBrock is working
        for his father." Ryan told Natalia tired "There's gotta be something."
        Natalia commented "There is, but it's not what you think." Ryan said
        going to the footage that you saw earlier "Heather found this while she
        was helping me." he hit play and explained what was happening on the
        screen. They discussed what was being shown and Ryan wasn't too happy
        about it. "Tell Heather thanks, you were to suffer alone but she
        helped." Natalia said and Ryan scoffed at that "Well, my wife loves me."
        he said proudly making Natalia laugh "Thanks Ryan." she said before
        leaving.

        Your shift was over and you were in the locker room gathering your
        things while waiting for Ryan because his was over as well "Hey you."
        you heard Ryan's voice that made you look towards him "Hey, all finished
        now?" "Yes mam and I am exhausted." Ryan said heading to his locker.
        "Same." you chuckled retrieving the last item you needed before closing
        your locker walking over to Ryan to lean against the locker beside his
        watching him "So, I was thinking, how about a shared relaxing bath and
        then a movie?" Ryan suggested looking towards you with a hopeful look
        and you smiled "That sounds so perfect right now." "So that's a yes?"
        you nodded "A definite yes, but also lets throw in a foot massage for
        me, cause my feet are killing me." that caused Ryan to look down at your
        high heel covered feet "New heels?" he asked and you nodded "Yeah, so my
        feet needs time to adjust." you chucked "Don't worry babe, I've got you
        covered, after all you were a major help today." you raised your brow at
        that "Really? With what?" you asked excited and Ryan chuckled "I'll tell
        you when we're surrounded by water and give you praises of how amazing
        you are." you chuckled "I do like the sound of that." "Let's get out of
        here." you both smiled and made your way out the building and home.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="story">
        "So what I found was a big help?" Ryan nodded as he sat across from you
        in the bath "You have no idea, because I found nothing else on those
        tapes. You did really well today beautiful." Ryan sent a wide smile your
        way which you matched "Well, I was just doing my job." Ryan shook his
        head "That wasn't your job, that was you being an amazing wife. Another
        perk to working with your wife." Ryan chuckled at that "So, you do like
        working with me?" you asked and Ryan leaned forward pulling you towards
        him to straddle his lap, arms wrapping around your waist, keeping you
        against him "I love working with you. I get to see the woman I love
        doing something she loves, and being super amazing at it. I get to see
        her beautiful face majority of my day. If I'm just feeling a little
        down, I can just go and talk to her or look at her and I'm feeling so
        much better. I get to secretly tell her I love her, I just haven't found
        out how to secretly kiss her yet without getting in trouble." that made
        you laugh "Ryan you can survive hours without kissing me, you've done it
        before, when we weren't working together." "I know but that was only
        because you weren't near me, but you are now and you know I have no
        self-control when it comes to you." you just shook your head "Well, you
        seem to be doing pretty well so far." you commented while reaching your
        hand up to play with the hair at the back of his head "On the outside I
        may look like I'm doing well, but on the inside it's a fighting battle,
        especially when you wear certain outfits that just tickles a certain
        part of my brain." you raised a brow "All of this battle goes on in
        here.." you asked touching his head first, then moving to his chest "or
        here.. Or?" you said moving your hand further down his body "Here?" you
        asked whispering in his ear and you felt and heard Ryan moan. His arms
        that were circled around your waist just tightened "What happened to
        just having a relaxing bath?" Ryan said trying to keep his breath even
        "Well, if that's what you want, I can stop." you said and Ryan was quick
        to protest by capturing your lips with his "Please don't." following his
        orders you didn't.
