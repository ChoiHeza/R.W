            Work at the lab was the usual, so with tablet in hand you were looking for someone, and that's when you ran into Natalia so you guys decided to walk together. You guys chatted till you reached the evidence locker that she had to go into, so you both paused to talk for a bit. "So what about tonight?" Natalia asked and at the same time Ryan got off the elevator and made his way towards you guys "What is tonight?" his voice made you both turn his direction "Hey" you both greeted him then you spoke "We were just making date plans." "Oh really, so you're taking my wife from me." Natalia laughed and shrugged "Maybe." you turned to her "Tonight is perfect." you said throwing a smile her way which she returned and Ryan just watched the interaction between you two "Well I gotta go." you said gesturing to the tablet "Nice seeing you Ryan." you said sending a wink his way "You too beautiful." with that you departed from them, heading to your destination "Still not back together?" Natalia asked Ryan gesturing between the two of you and Ryan shook his head "We're taking it slow, it's like dating." Ryan chuckled "At least that's nice, she's giving you a chance. So what do you need?" Natalia asked getting to work and Ryan explained "Well, it's $300 a hour and I'm broke, and I have debts to pay off before Heather comes back." Natalia nodded understanding so they started discussing until Ryan played a card that questioned Ryan's loyalty. Natalia felt hurt and betrayed. "I'm sorry." Ryan apologized before leaving with evidence in hand.

            After the incident Natalia was questioned for her work of conduct "Then do the same to Wolfe." Natalia shook her head "I can't do that." "Come on, just one bad thing on him, that'll ruin him." Natalia thought for a moment and was a bit tempted but you caught her attention as you were walking by the room talking with someone and she couldn't find it in her heart because at the end of the day, it wasn't done intentional by Ryan and he's just doing what he can to get you back, so ruining him meant ruining you as well, and you guys have gotten a chance to be close. So shaking her head once she replied "I'm sorry, I just can't." the lady she was talking to sighed "Okay, well it's your career." with that she got up and left.

            It was the end of your shift and you were in the locker room waiting for Natalia so you guys can head out together. "Hey, I hope I didn't keep you waiting." Natalia said making you look her direction "No mam. I not too long got here myself, so you ready to go?" "Just let me get my things and we can go." after the stunt that Ryan pulled today, it wouldn't be fair to you if she got mad at you as well cause you weren't at fault and had nothing to do with it. She was contemplating if to tell you about what he did, or would that make things worse between you and him. "Hey, everything okay, you seem to be lost in thought?" you asked as you watched her "No, was just making sure I completed something in the lab." she shook her head throwing a smile your way so you nodded "Okay." "Ready?" "Yes, let's go." you said cheerfully and she chuckled and you both left for a fun filled evening.
