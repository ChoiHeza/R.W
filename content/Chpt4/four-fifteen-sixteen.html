            You in the mirror putting on your earrings when Ryan asked you a question "Tie or no tie?" you turned to look at him as he kept placing and removing the tie from his chest "Definitely tie." you commented coming over to him as he slipped it on "Why? The shirt looked to plain without it?" you shook your head "Nah, I just want to be able to do this." you said as you approached him and took hold of his tie pulling him towards you to connect his lips with yours. Ryan was caught off guard but composed quickly hands going to grip your hips "I love it when you do that." Ryan said as you pulled away looking at you with darkened eyes "I know you do, that's why I love doing it." you winked before placing one more peck and walking out of his hold "You're wicked you know that." Ryan said shaking his head as you both start to leave the bedroom "Whatever do you mean?" you said sounding completely innocent "Kissing me like that, knowing I can't do anything about it because it'll make us very very… late for work." Ryan said dragging out the last very as you got your bag "Well, that wasn't my intention. I just saw the tie and took advantage of the situation." you smirked at him and Ryan chuckled "Still wicked." with that you both got what you needed before leaving for work.

            You received a very weird email, so checking it out you saw it was a Calleigh website and found it really suspicious, so wasting no time, you got to work finding out what you can about it. While working on it you got a call, without checking the I.D. you answered your cell " CSI Lab Tech, Heather Wolfe." Ryan loved the new title but he didn't had time to fawn over it "Hey babe, I need you to do something for me." "Sure, I'm listening." "I need you to check out the Calleigh website and tell me what you can find." you chuckled "I'm already on, when I received the email, I found it really suspicious so I got to work on it right away." "Gosh you're perfect." you chuckled "Just doing my job babe." "Okay okay, well I'm currently working on something, and once I'm finished I'll join you, okay?" "You got it." with that you both hung up and got serious. "Hey." you heard Ryan's voice as he entered the lab "That was quick." "Can't let my beautiful wife do all the hard work." he said coming beside you and giving your lower back a tap "Aren't you the sweetest. Well what are you waiting for, get to work." you said gesturing to the other surface computer behind you. "Yes mam." Ryan said going over to it, and you started to discuss what you had found out so far. A couple minutes passed before another voice entered the lab "If it isn't the Wolfe couple working together." it was Valera said causing you both to chuckle "Uh, what are you guys doing on Calleigh's website?" she asked with concern in her voice "Someone's interfering with an investigation, and we're going to figure out who it is." Ryan answered as Valera went to stand behind him. "There are over 10,000 hits. I thought that email only went out to us lab rats." she asked "Yeah, well, it went viral." you stated then Ryan continued "Hence our urgency." "Well, can't you just look up who the site is registered to?" she asked to no one in particular but you answered "I did. It's Sir Berners-Lee." you chuckled looking back towards Ryan and Valera and their faces were blank "He created the internet, so obviously, that's a fake." they caught on late and you just shook your head "That joke would of killed at the office." you sighed turning back to your screen "Sorry babe." Ryan apologized and you waved him off "It's okay." your phone rang again "CSI Lab Tech, Heather Wolfe." you answered and that caused Ryan to look up towards you. "I have it, I'll be there."  you hung up and picked up your tablet "Sorry, I'm need elsewhere. You got this right?" you asked turning heading Ryan's direction "Of course, go." he winked and threw a smile your way which you returned, so leaning up you whispered in his ear "Good boy." with an innocent smile before turning to Valera and giving her a wave "See ya." she said and you were gone. While leaving Ryan had his eyes trained on you until you were out of sight because of the phrase you just told him. Would it be so bad that he liked it. So snapping out of it he returned back to work and Valera just chuckled at his actions "Anyways, to continue from what Heather was saying, she also followed a bunch of IP addresses; it all pretty much led to nowhere." Ryan said being serious again "Wow, someone's really covering their tracks." Valera said as she looked on "Yeah. If we're going to find this guy, we're gonna have to find him on his level." Ryan said coming up with an idea "Meaning?" Valera asked curious "The source code." he voiced his plan "That gobbledygook make sense to you?" Valera asked super confused as she looked at the screen and saw a bunch of letter and numbers that made no sense to her "Yeah, I actually pay attention to my wife when she talks about her work. One time I watched her build a simple website and she explain it all to me. So yeah, those numbers control the background colour and the text. And that one's for the video player." Ryan said explaining to Valera "Like, how YouTube works." she said trying to understand "Yeah, but this is a different flash video player. In fact… aside from a couple of tweaks, it's exactly like the one we use." Ryan said piecing it all together and figuring out who was behind it "So?" Valera asked wanting to be looped in "That's custom-coded for us." Ryan explained more "By who?" she asked but Ryan already had his phone out calling Calleigh's number "Hey, Calleigh, it's me. Yeah, I know who's messing with you." "Who?" she asked really wanting to know "Cooper." with that she wasted no time in getting into action and Valera gasped beside Ryan.

            Valera eventually left and Ryan remained behind just surfing the site to see if anything else popped up at him. That's when you returned coming beside Ryan "Still here? Managed to find out who it was?" you asked looking at the screen "With your help, I did manage to find out who it was." you raised a brow "My help? I had to leave early." you turned looking at him confused and he did the same, but a smile graced his lips "Yes, from whenever you talk about what you're coding, and showing me." you immediately caught on to what Ryan did "You looked at the source code?" Ryan nodded and a proud smile reached your face, raising your hand for a high hive, Ryan accepted it "That's pretty impressive babe. So who is it?" asked turning back to the screen "See for yourself." he pulled up the code for you to look at and upon inspection realization came to mind "That son of a bitch." you said whipping your head around to Ryan and that caused him to react, cause you don't ever swear "Damn babe." he was surprised "Sorry, but he's just awful. Did you let Calleigh know?" Ryan nodded "I did. I bet she's over there as we speak." "I hope she punches him." Ryan chuckled "Alright. Calm down." "I am calm, and I mean it. He deserves it." you said folding your arms "She'll know how to handle him, don't worry." "With Calleigh, I'm far from worried." you said smiling, before heading back over to your computer.

            While walking Eric saw Natalia looking at the website and when he talked to her about it Cooper updated the website just making things so much worse, so Eric immediately got worried and headed towards your direction "Hey Heather, I need you to do something." you heard Eric's voice as he rushed into the lab, it was all serious and a hint of worry "Sure, what is it?" "I need you to track her hummer and tell me where she is." "Okay." you said beginning the tracking "Is everything okay?" you asked concerned "I'm not sure, Calleigh went out on a call and I'm not getting a response from her and Cooper is making everything so much worse. Don't you think you can stop him?" Eric asked you "What you think I've been doing when you came in here." the computer pinged displaying multiple locations but not hers "He couldn't have sent her out on a fake call. She just had her number changed." Eric said then you looked over to your other screen with the website and looked through it quickly, finding something that you were hoping not to see "Yeah, he could have." you said alerting Eric, as you pointed to the other screen "He posted her new number." panic settled in the both of you and Eric started to leave, you know exactly where he was planning on going "Hey Eric." you called halting him "Don't try and stop me Heather." you gave him a serious look "I'm not going to. I was just going to tell you, give him hell." you said with a nod which Eric replied with one himself and a smile before leaving the lab. A few minutes passed before Ryan entered the lab "Hey, have you seen Delko, I'm not getting hold of him." you turned with a shy smile on your lips "Oh no, what happened." you explained to Ryan and he sighed before running a hand along his face "Did you try to stop him?" when Ryan asked that you avoided eye contact and he caught on "Babe, what did you tell Delko?" you looked slowly towards Ryan before replying "I told Eric to give him hell." "Really Heather?" you shrugged "Calleigh's disappearance is clearly his fault, no more playing nice, plus who am I to stop Eric." Ryan sighed knowing that you're right "I know but still." you held your hands up in defense to show your innocence and Ryan just chuckled "What am I going to do with you." he said while leaving the lab, hoping your encouragement didn't get Delko in trouble.

            Cooper showed up at the lab feeling sorry for what he did, so he delivered the memory card that he swiped from Calleigh that morning to Eric, so he quickly made his way towards you and Natalia tagged along. You inserted the card and started pulling up the images of the crime scene hoping to find something that can help. You all discussed as you went through the photos, Natalia was pointing of the similarities between the victim from the case and Calleigh so Eric decided to make a comment "I won't let Calleigh end up like her." you rested a comforting hand on his arm "I know you won't" you said truthfully and Eric really appreciated the support. While still going through the photos, something caught Natalia's eye, making you zoom in on the photo. After realizing it might be missing evidence, Eric gave Ryan a call to go see if he could find it.

            The long grueling day was over and Calleigh was safe and sound. So while in the locker room Eric turned to you "Thanks for today Heather, we couldn’t have done it without." Eric said closing his locker smiling "I care for Calleigh, so I was just doing what was needed." you said truthfully but Eric really appreciated cause he could of lost Calleigh today, so feeling very generous he pulled you into a hug making you chuckle "Damn, you must really love Calleigh." you joked causing Eric to laugh "Shush." he said pulling away "Take her home." you said randomly and Eric raised his brow "After the day she just had, don't let her be alone, take her home." you said smiling "You sure?" you nodded "100 percent sure. That's what I would of wanted." Eric thought for a moment before taking your advice "I will, thanks." you nodded "Anytime lover boy." you chuckled and he joined before leaving wishing you a good evening. At that exact moment Ryan came into the room, told Eric safe travels "Hey beautiful." Ryan greeted when he caught sight of you going to his locker. So retrieving your bag, you closed yours and headed towards Ryan "Hey. I'm just ready to go home and spend the rest of my day in my husbands' arms." you said with a smile on your lips as you leaned against the locker next to Ryan's and your head followed "It really was a long day." you nodded "Let me quickly get my things so we can go home." you smiled and mouthed a thank you.

            After getting home, you guys ate then showered and was now currently in bed cuddled in each other arms watching tv. With your head laid on Ryan's chest, eyes closed you felt him rub your back before speaking "I just remembered something from today." "What is that?" you asked eyes remaining closed "You called me a good boy." you immediately smiled raising up to look at Ryan "I did. What about it?" you looked in his eyes searching for any hint that he didn’t like it but you found none "Is it weird that I liked it?" Ryan said, more like questioned and you laughed shaking your head "No baby, it isn't weird." you kissed his cheek before laying back down "You know, if you like, you can tell me that phrase from time to time." you giggled "If I like, or do you mean, if you like?" "You know you don't have to make things so technical." you chuckled now "You know it's completely okay to have a praise kink." you said looking up at him once again "I guess that's something I never realized I had." he said looking down at you after some thought "Well I think it's cute that you're now discovering this." you took hold of his check before placing a kiss to his lips "And you're okay with it?" you nodded "Of course, I have it too." you slyly smiled before laying back on his chest. Ryan thought for a moment "Now that I really think about it, you actually do." "Took you long enough." you chuckled and Ryan tightened his arms around your waist "Oh, sex is going to be so much more fun going forward, now that I'm aware." you chuckled at that and rolled your eyes "Only you would come to a conclusion like that." you stated and Ryan laughed "Of course. I'm only human, and a human that loves everything about you." he said kissing your forehead "Well, this other human loves everything about you too." you smiled at the comment "Thank goodness she does." that caused you too laugh before you both turned back to the tv, with Ryan watching and your eyes closed. It didn’t take long before you both fell asleep, you went first and Ryan followed soon right after, cause he wanted to make sure that you went to sleep before he allowed his own slumber to overtake him.
