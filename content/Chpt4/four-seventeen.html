            "I can't believe they didn't have the chocolate you liked." Ryan commented as you both walked through the car park making way to his car with grocery bags in hand "It's okay, I'm sure the convenient store near us will have them." you said with some hopefulness "Want to check there before we go home?" you nodded with a grin "Yes please." Ryan chuckled at your response "You got it.". You both approached the car now and Ryan unlocked it as you both headed for the trunk. With the bags in Ryan closed it before turning to you "I'm gonna go and pay the toll so just wait here." you nodded as Ryan walked off.  So you decided to lean against the car and wait for his return, at that same time you felt a ding from your phone and checked to see it was a message from Monica. While texting away with her, you were unaware of your surroundings and didn't realize that someone with wrong intentions was approaching you. Catching you off guard, you felt someone took hold of you, capturing your mouth with their hand so that if you screamed your voice would be muffled. You immediately started to struggle within their grasp but it was their voice that stopped your action "Missed me gorgeous?" it was the voice of the blonde guy from the bar, so you started to struggle more than before hoping to free your mouth so you could shout for Ryan. "Come on hun. That's futile, no one is around." he said starting to drag you away, so thinking quick, you threw back your head to hit his and that caused him to release your mouth for a quick second so you wasted no time in shouting "Ryan!" you made sure to shout very loudly and the man immediately cursed under his breath, so while distracted you brought down your foot on his and he released your mouth so taking what you learnt you hooked his hand and flipped him, pinning him down, holding his hand in a very uncomfortable position behind his back. While Ryan was making his way back after paying for the toll, he heard you shout his name, so panic immediately settled in him making him take off towards your direction. "Heather!" he shouted back when you came into view, on top of a guy pinning him down. So taking out his gun, he made his way towards you pointing it at the guy. "Hey, you okay?" he asked, voice laced with concern so you released a breathe before nodding. Ryan took hold of the situation, by taking your place and placing cuffs on the guy. "That's the guy, from the bar." you said bending over trying to catch your breath and Ryan got angry, so he pulled the guy into sitting position "How dare you touch my wife? I swear to God, if I was there that night I would of made sure you got what you deserved." Ryan said with anger laced in his voice so you reached out for him to calm him down "Babe it's okay. He's clearly not worth it. I took him down, while wearing heals." you said raising a brow and Ryan realized you were correct. So a proud smile over took his face while looking at you, then turned back to the guy with a scowl "I'll call this in." Ryan said as he pulled out his phone.

            It wasn't long before the guy was taken away, cause a patrol car was in the area. After everything was settled Ryan turned to you cupping your face "Are you sure you're okay baby?" he asked inspecting you and you nodded "I'm perfect." you replied with a smile reassuring him "You're a lowkey badass aren't you?" Ryan asked with a smirk removing his hands from your face capturing yours and you shrugged "Maybe." you chuckled but getting serious "As a black small woman living in America, I have to be." you told him truthfully "Well, I must say, you can hold your own and it settles my heart to know that if I'm not with you, you can handle it." he said giving you a proud smile "But I still have lots to learn." you chuckled "Then I will teach them all to you." he pushed a piece of hair behind your ears before placing a kiss to your forehead "Now let's get my badass wife home, because I didn't know watching you take down a guy was such a turn on." Ryan smirked and you wiggled your eyebrows "If you wanted me to take you down baby, you just had to ask." you said with a wink causing Ryan to groan, "Home, now." he said making you both quickly get into the car, heading off to your humble abode.

            "Have I told you that I love you?" Ryan said as he laid on his side looking towards you, making you open your eyes "Yes, about five minutes ago." you said shifting from laying on your stomach to match Ryan's position. "Well, I am going to tell you again. I love you." he told you taking hold of your waist pulling you against his body "And truthfully, I can't get enough of you." you pretended to think for a moment deciding to be a tease "I remember a while ago, I thought I wasn't enough to satisfy you." you said with a sly smile making Ryan groan, falling to his back before bringing his arm to cover his eyes. His actions made you chuckle. "Is that not what happened?" you asked poking his side "Yeah, but it wasn't what I meant, and I regreted saying it to this very day." Ryan said looking at you before covering back his eyes. You got up now and straddled Ryan's bare lap "Do you regret saying it because that night I showed you that I was in fact too much for you?" you said smugly rocking your hips, and the memory along with your current action caused 'Ryan' to wake up. "Well, I regret saying it because it wasn't the truth but not because how the night turned out." Ryan said removing his arm and finally looking up at you, loving the view that was provided to him "Hmm." Ryan felt that you were about to move off him so he captured your hips to keep you in place "Where do you think you're going?" Ryan asked with a raised brow "To shower." you replied innocently and Ryan shook his head "No you're not. You have something to take care of first." he said gesturing downwards causing you to smile "Can't get enough of me huh?" you asked lowering your body, lips hovering over Ryan's and that caused him to smile "I donâ€™t think that would ever be possible." his replied which caused you to immediately connect your lips with his in a very heated kiss, starting off round two.
