        "So which one are we doing, club or bar?" Natalia asked both you and
        Calleigh as you all were in the locker room "Was kind of a long day, so
        the bar should suffice for now." Calleigh stated and you nodded your
        head "I agree." "The bar it is." Natalia said retrieving her bag "Bar?"
        Eric's voice sounded just as he entered the room with Ryan beside him
        "Yes, bar. We're having a girls night." Natalia told him "Are we
        invited?" Ryan asked and you chuckled "No babe, hence it's called girls
        night." you said pointing a finger at them "Okay okay." Ryan and Eric
        laughed. After you guys got everything, you bid the men goodbye before
        leaving for a night of fun.

      <p class="story">
        You guys were chatting from one thing to another when your drink ran
        out. "I gotta get a fill up. Anyone needs anything?" and they both shook
        their head before you got up "Okay, be right back." you left them and
        headed for the bar "Another one of these please." you said to the
        bartender resting down your glass "You got it love." he said taking your
        glass and you offered him a smile. So while you were waiting for your
        drink, a blonde guy approached you "Hey there gorgeous." you gave him a
        tightened smile "Hi." you replied and turned back to watch the bartender
        make your drink so the guy could at least get a hint that you weren't
        interested "Come here often?" he asked clearly not getting the message
        "No, I don't." "Here by yourself?" he asked coming a little closer "No,
        I came with friends." you said gesturing to your table with Natalia and
        Calleigh "I see. You all are very pretty, but you caught my eye." you
        just nodded and started to move away from him but he just kept coming
        closer "So you have a boyfriend?" sighing, you eyed him and raised your
        hand showing the ring "I'm married." you replied dropping your hand to
        the counter top "And he allowed someone like you to come here without
        him. Doesnâ€™t sound like he cares very much." just when you were about to
        tell him a piece of your mind, the bartender called out "Here you go
        love." he said placing down your drink for you, so you thanked him and
        quickly took up your drink wanting to get away from the blonde as
        quickly as possible but he caught your wrist "Hey, it's very rude to
        just walk away from a conversation." the action caused you to jerk,
        spilling a bit of your drink "Let go of me." you told him sternly but he
        just smirked at you "Now you want to talk to me." he said coming even
        closer to you, so feeling threatened you tossed your drink at him and
        mashed his foot which caused him to release his grip from you, so you
        slipped out of his grip putting distance between you two "When a woman
        says let go, you let go." you said annoyed and turned to head back to
        your table but he took hold of your arm this time and pulled you against
        him "Listen here bitch, you need to be learnt a lesson." just as you
        were about defend yourself, you felt his body ripped from yours. It was
        the bartender that had him pinned across the counter. "We don't allow
        that kind of behaviour here." he told him sternly, holding him captive
        and the blonde tried to fight him off but failed "Now get the hell out
        before I call the cops." the bartender eased up and they both stood, so
        the blonde looked towards you with an angry look "You better watch
        yourself." those were his last words before he left pissed. A scene was
        caused now as people looked on, that caught Natalia and Calleigh's
        attention. You turned to the bartender and thanked him "You okay?" he
        asked resting a hand on your shoulder "I am, thank you again." he smiled
        "Anytime." then he turned to the crowd, "Nothing to see here people!" he
        shouted before heading back to work. He told you not to worry about the
        drink, you won't be charged for it and he'll make you another one. Natalia and Calleigh approached you
        from the crowd "You okay?" "What happened?" they both asked
        simultaneously causing you to chuckle so you just explained everything
        to them, "Well you should of shouted for us." you laughed at what Natalia
        said "I could handle myself, but I will remember that, now, let's get
        back to what we were doing." you said cheerily "You sure?" Calleigh
        asked worried and you nodded "I will not allow some man to ruin my night
        and stop our fun." you said truthfully and they all agreed before
        continuing the fun. Drinks were consumed and it was time to go home.
        Luckily you all weren't that intoxicated and well enough to drive, so
        you hugged and parted ways.

      <p class="story">
        "Ryan!" you practically shouted coming in through the door. He was
        lounging on the sofa watching tv, waiting till you came home, so at your
        loud voice he chuckled before getting up "Someone is drunk." he said
        approaching you all smiles and you shook your head taking off your
        shoes, stumbling a bit "I'm not. I'm fine." you said partially true but
        it's like the moment you entered your home you felt the in toxicity of
        the drinks hit you "Right, says the woman struggling with her shoes. Let
        me." he said approaching, bending down to help you take them off so you
        rested your hands on his shoulders to steady yourself "Ooo, someone has
        very strong shoulders." you said feeling them up causing Ryan to chuckle
        "Did you drive home?" Ryan asked standing back up holding you and you
        nodded rapidly so he gave you a stern look "You drove while drunk?" you shook your head once again "I wasn't. I swear. It's like it suddenly
        hit me the more I walked to the apartment." Ryan just sighed, he
        believed you because he has witnessed it before "So you had fun I take
        it?" you nodded with a grin taking over your features "So much fun. I
        love Calleigh and Natalia. But except that one guy. He hurt my wrist."
        you sulked at the end with a pout massaging your wrist, seeing now that
        a bruise was in the place he held. Catching Ryan's eyes he gently took
        your hand, worry falling over his face "What happened babe?" he asked as
        he was inspecting the bruise "Some stupid guy tried talking to me, and got
        mad when I ignored him." you sulked some more and Ryan was starting to
        get annoyed, that some guy had the audacity to lay their hands on you.
        "So I threw my drink at him and stomped his foot making him let me go,
        but before I could of gotten away, he grabbed me again on my arm." you
        said showing Ryan the other spot and there was a bruise there as well
        "and when I was about to defend myself, the bartender did it for me, he
        was so cool." you giggled at the end but Ryan was still mad at what the
        guy did "Why didn't you call me?" he asked sternly and you just sighed
        "Why Ryan? I'm a big girl. I can take care of myself. If that bartender
        didn't stop him, I would of showed him how tough I was." you said
        puffing out your chest and Ryan couldn't stay mad long because you were
        too cute before him "So what happened to the guy?" Ryan asked gently
        massaging your bruises "The bartender kicked him out, but before he
        left, he threatened me." you said with a nonchalant shrug and Ryan
        swallowed hard hoping it was an empty threat and not a real one. "Why
        did you stay after what happened?" Ryan asked so you quickly looked
        towards him and pointed a finger to his chest "How do you know that?
        Were you spying on me?" you asked with silted eyes and Ryan chuckled "I
        could tell from your bruises. If it just happened, they wouldn't look
        like this." your brain wasn't braining at the moment so you gasped "Oh
        my gosh. How do you know all of that, are you a wizard?" you asked truly
        amazed now, with wide eyes and Ryan just chuckled at you shaking his
        head "Yes baby, I am a wizard." he said taking your hand and gently
        leading you to the bedroom "Where are you taking me, to your dungeon?"
        you said wiggling your eyebrows causing Ryan to laugh "I'm taking to the
        bathroom so you can take a bath and sober up." "That sounds lame." you
        pouted as you both entered the bedroom "Strip. I'll get the water
        ready." you giggled "Yes sir." you said seductively, or tried to sound
        seductive, Ryan just shook his head before disappearing to the bathroom
        "What am I going to do with you."
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="story">
        You were in the bath now, and the warm water surrounding you just felt
        so welcoming. You were splashing like a child enjoying the sounds and
        the water flying up. Ryan stood in the door way, leaning against it,
        just watching you, with a smile graced on his lips. He's thankful that
        you were okay and had fun. Also that you didn't allow some guy to ruin
        your night. He watched as you lowered your head to make bubbles, so
        pushing himself off the frame he walked over to you "I see you're having
        fun." his voice caught your attention making you look up at him with a
        grin "Look look, I can make bubbles." you giggled before showing Ryan
        and he just looked on laughing "This was supposed to sober you up."
        he said sitting on the edge of the tub looking down at you "I told you,
        I'm sober." you said trying to sound normal as possible "Well, your eyes
        are giving you away. Try leaning back and closing your eyes to relax."
        "Fine." you said with rolled eyes but did as told. You stayed like that
        for a while, and you don't know what happened but it seemed to work
        because instantly you felt very tired. All the energy you had just now
        just immediately vaporized from your body. A very tired sigh left your
        lips and Ryan knew he succeeded in making you sober. "There we go." he
        said before helping you get out and washing off. With your towel on, you
        slowly walked to the bedroom crashing on the bed. Ryan knows how your
        body gets when it crashes so not pushing you he went to the dresser and
        got clothes for you. "Come on baby, sit up for me. You can't sleep in
        the towel." he said coming over to you helping you sit up. Taking off
        the towel, he helped you into a tank top and shorts. The moment his
        hands left your body, you immediately flopped back down onto the bed
        making Ryan chuckle. He just shook his head saying once again "What am I
        doing to do with you."
