            "Well look at you." you said referring to Ryan as you entered the bedroom "Well, my wife woke me up in a very pleasant way, so I said, why not the green." Ryan said knowing how much you love green on him. So you approached him rubbing your hands along his clothed chest before taking hold of his waist "Well, I must say, mama likes." you said with a wink looking into his eyes and that made a proud smile appear on his face "All for you baby." Ryan said with a smirk hands circling your waist pulling you against him "Sucks we have jobs, and responsibilities." you sighed bringing your hand up to rub along his jaw line so Ryan raised a brow "You want to do more?" he said referring to this morning "Well, it wasn't my intention, but it's the green on you. You know what that does to me." you said bringing yourself to place kisses along Ryan's jaw. Ryan felt very happy that he caused this reaction from you but he also felt pained because there wasn't any time to indulge you "As much as I'm loving this, we can't or we're going to be late." Ryan's statement made you groan "Ugh, fine. But so you know, you've felt your wife completely unsatisfied." you said with a poke to his chest before stepping out his arms and Ryan sighed "Now babe, that's not fair." you just shrugged "Life isn't." you replied before existing the bedroom "Let's go.". Just grabbing the remainder of your things you both left for work.

            Arriving and being assigned your cases, Ryan's heart sank when he found out you won't be working together today, cause one, you were annoyed to begin with and he was hoping to spend some time with you while working to make up for it and two, he just loved working with you. So saying your byes, you both headed to your tasks. The day went on smoothly, just the usual and Ryan was hoping to get any sort of interaction with you but none, because he didn't had to use the surface computer for the case, but the moment that he got word that Alexx was leaving the department, he wasted no time in finding you, to tell you the news. So heading to the computer lab, where he knew you'll be, he saw your figure from outside in front one of the computers working. Smiling he entered the lab and alerted you of his presence "Hey babe." the sound of his voice made you look around with smile "Hey, what brings you here?" you asked pausing what you're doing to look at him, but before he told you the news, he realized something "You’re not annoyed anymore?" you raised a brow in question "What do you mean?" "From this morning?" he said hoping you would catch on and a look of realization crossed your face "Oh, I was never annoyed. I knew it wasn't your fault and we had work. I just felt like being bratty." you said chuckling causing Ryan to be amazed "Oh really now?" he licked his lips before going to grab your waist but you smacked his hand away before he touched you "We're at work, behave." you warned and Ryan raised his hands in defense "My apologies." "But don't stop the moment we get off work though." you said with a wink causing Ryan to groan "Babe, you can't be saying these things to me while at work. It's hard enough already not being able to touch you." "You can touch me Ryan." "I know, but I want to touch you the way that would get us fired." you chuckled "Now we don’t want that. So with flirting aside what did you come to see me for? Or was it just to flirt with me, cause Ryan Wolfe, I would smack you." you said, your face turning stern and Ryan dismissed you with a wave of hands "I came to talk to you about Alexx, she's leaving the department." your eyes widened "Like resigning?" Ryan nodded "If that's what she wants, I'll support it. But I am going to miss her dearly though. When I'm finished here I'm going to go down there." you told Ryan and just as he was about to reply his phone rang "It's H, I gotta take this." he said apologetically "It's okay, go, I gotta hurry and finish up here before going down." Ryan nodded before answering the phone and leaving the room but not forgetting to give you a tap on your lower back.

            Just as you were finished you headed down to Alexx. Knocking on the morgue doors before entering and the moment she caught a glimpse of your face a huge grin grew on hers "Hey baby, I supposed you heard huh?" you nodded going over to her "I did. Ryan just told me and I can't believe you're actually leaving." in front of her now, you both hugged tightly before holding hands after pulling apart "I know, but it feels like it's time for me to move on. Help with the living this time, so they won't end up down here." your heart swelled at that "That sounds amazing, and you know you have my full support." you told her truthfully "Thank you very much sweetie. Now just because I'm leaving doesn't mean we stop hanging out. You're still invited over for dinner, cause after all us woman of colour have to stick together." she said nodding while reaching up to push a piece of your hair behind your ear and that caused you to pull her into a hug once again, but tighter this time "Would it be weird if I cry?" you said chuckling and she did as well "No baby, we'll just be twins." when you pulled away you saw she had tears in her eyes as well, so you both laughed at that "Want help with anything?" you asked while wiping your eyes "Of course." so you helped out Alex until she was ready to leave and walked up with her to the lab floor so she could hug the others bye. You guys hugged once more before you watched her walked down the hall, first hugging Natalia, then Ryan, then Calleigh and lastly Eric, cause he just came out the elevator. So before heading back to your lab you went to Ryan "Hey, you okay?" Ryan asked the moment he saw your face "I'm fine, we just had a little cry sess. Is it obvious?" you said chuckling and Ryan shook his head "No you're fine, I know you both were close." he said gently resting his hand on your lower back rubbing gently "We're all going to miss her around here." Ryan nodded "We all will." you guys watched as she left and the elevator closed on her "Well, I gotta head back to the lab." you told Ryan thumbing towards your direction "Same." he said gesturing to the room behind him "See you after work." "You know it." Ryan said with a wink causing you to laugh before you both separated heading your directions.

            "What a day" you said crashing on the sofa as you both just got home "Tell me about it." Ryan said following your actions but he turned to look at you admiring your resting features "You're beautiful." he said in awe and that made you open your eyes turning to look at him "You're beautiful too." you said causing him to chuckle "What?" you asked sitting up now and he shook his head "It’s nothing." so you raised a brow "You sure?" and he nodded "Positive." so giving him a look you laid back against the sofa but Ryan shifted his position to lay in your lap. Hands immediately going to run through his hair "You know, I'm a fan of this messy style you wear. I love it." Ryan looked up at you with a smile "Thank you. I know you do." "What's that supposed to mean?" you asked looking down at him and he smirked "I can just tell that you love the style based on the way you grab my hair when I'm between your legs." his reply made you gasp "Ryan!" that caused him to laugh at you "You know it's true babe." he said smugly and you covered your face cause it heated up "Come on, don't hide that gorgeous face from me." he reached up removing your hands "Gosh, you're so shameless." now it was Ryan's turn to gasp but fakely "Me? Shameless? Babe, you're just as bad as I am, or even worse." he said sitting up "I don't know what you're talking about." you said getting up, heading for the bedroom "Oh really now?" he smiled following after you "If I had to recall every shameless thing you said, I could write a book." his reply made you chuckle "Now you're exaggerating." Ryan shrugged "Maybe, maybe not." so halting you turned to look at him "Let's agree, we're both just as bad." you said reaching out your hand, and he looked between you and the hand before taking it in his giving you a shake "Agreed." you both shared a smile "Let's go shower, I want to eat and watch a movie." Ryan said starting to strip and you nodded "That sounds perfect."
