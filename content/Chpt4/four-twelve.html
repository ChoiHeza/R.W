        You were currently in the bath when Ryan came home, and you were only
        alerted of his presence when he entered the bathroom "Hey there
        handsome." you said sitting up looking towards him "Hey babe." he came
        over and leaned down to give you a kiss, but before he could pull back
        you kept him there by wrapping your hands around his neck. You wasted no
        time in deepening the kiss before Ryan pulled away leaving him feeling
        dizzy "Whoa." that made you grin at the effect you had on him. Before
        Ryan had time to register his thoughts you were standing in the tub
        pulling him towards you "Babe, what is going on?" Ryan chuckled but
        lowkey was loving it "Get in." "But I'm still wearing my clothes." "So,
        just get in." you told him and before he could of said anything, you
        captured back his lips with a heated kiss. Ryan caved instantly and
        quickly shed his jacket before joining you in the tub, because whatever
        it was you were feeling, he was ready to indulge.

        You were laying on the bed as Ryan walked out the bathroom towel drying
        his hair. "Not going to put on any clothes" Ryan asked as he saw your
        naked form tangled in the blankets "I refuse to put on clothes." you
        said causing Ryan to chuckle "Well I won't complain about that." he hung
        up his towel before coming to lay between your open legs hovering over
        you "Ryan, your hair is still wet." you whined as you felt drops drip
        onto your face "Want to dry it for me then?" "Please" you said and Ryan
        left you going back for the towel and in the mean time you sat up. "Well
        hello there." Ryan said with a smirk as he saw your exposed chest
        "Behave and sit down." you said rolling your eyes "Yes mam.", Ryan sat
        facing you, handing you the towel. He pulled you onto his lap so you
        would be higher and the moment he lowered his head you got to work. Soft
        hums left him as you rubbed the towel through his hair "When were you
        planning on telling me about the fire that you and Alexx got caught up
        in today?" Ryan paused your actions by looking up, hands going to your
        waist "How did you find out?" he asked curious "I have my ways, so, were
        you planning on telling me?" you asked again wanting an answer "Not
        really, no. I know I promised to tell you these things but a part of me
        really doesnâ€™t want to worry you." that made you smile "Well, you can't
        hide much anymore, we do work together now." you stated matter of factly
        and Ryan chuckled "That is true." he said and you gestured for him to
        lower back his head as you continued drying his hair. "You're not mad
        right?" you thought for a moment "I'm not, don't worry." you reassured
        him, and that caused his hands to tighten on your waist pulling you
        closer "What are you doing?" you asked, cause his actions stopped you
        from drying his hair "I'm hugging you." he replied so you dropped the
        towel and engulfed him in your arms, pulling him closer to you as well.
        Just when you thought it was a sweet innocent hug, you felt Ryan bite
        your left breast. "Ryan!" you said smacking his back causing him to
        laugh "Babe, you know I am going to interfere with you if you're dressed
        like this." he said matter of factly looking up at you "Haven't you had
        enough of me already for the evening?" you questioned and Ryan
        innocently shook his head "I can never have enough of you." he stated
        kissing your lips before moving to your neck. "Well someone is clearly
        in a loving mood." you said leaning your head, giving Ryan more access
        to your neck "Well, almost dying does that to you." he said and you
        thought 'He does have point.' so whatever he wants you aren't one to
        deny him.
