        You were currently going through the footage from the elevator where the
        murder took place that morning hoping to see if the killers' face was
        caught on the camera. That's when you heard footsteps you know oh so
        well entered the lab "Hey babe." Ryan said as you felt him tap your
        lower back before going to stand beside the desk screen to be closer to
        the main screen. "Take a look at this." you told him putting the footage
        up for him to see "Wow. Is this from the camera in the elevator?" Ryan
        asked leaning on the desk watching "Yeah. This is the footage from right
        before the murder." you said showing the victim on screen "Look at that,
        from bedroom to coffin." you commented watching the different things
        that happened on the screen "Poor kid never saw what was coming." Ryan
        said as you both watched on "I know." there was a bit of somber in your
        voice "Oh" you said as the victim got shoot on the screen and Ryan
        looked back to check to see if you were okay "You okay?" you smiled and
        nodded to reassure him "I'm fine, it's not my first time seeing someone
        dying. Don't worry." you told him and he kept looking at you "I'm fine
        Ryan, really." you told him truthfully and he believed you before
        turning back to the screen and you replayed the footage "You see that?"
        Ryan pointed out "The killer never entered the elevator." "Yeah, let me
        take it right back. I'm gonna take it back to the muzzle flash" you said
        rewinding to the moment right before the shot "See it?" you asked "Yeah,
        I see it." Ryan confirmed "Yeah, there's a reflective spot right there."
        you said pointing to it "You can't see the shooter's face but you can
        see his sleeve." you said upon observation "Yeah, he's got a green band
        around the cuff of his sleeve." Ryan commented looking at the paused
        photo you enhanced "That means it was a hotel worker jacket." Ryan said coming
        to the conclusion so you added "So our killer might be an employee." you
        both shared a look before Ryan pulled out his phone to call Natalia
        "Thanks babe, you're amazing as always." Ryan said stroking your arm
        before leaving you there with a smile tattooed on your face.

        Your shift was over but Ryan still had some extra work to do, so you
        were going to leave and run some errands before coming back to pick him
        up, because you both rode together that morning. You were currently
        outside the department being escorted by Ryan to the car when you guys
        saw Natalia and went towards her. She just came from talking to the
        victim's mother "How did she take it?" Ryan asked as Natalia approached
        you "As any mother would on receiving such news." Natalia said with a
        sad smile and you stood beside Natalia backing the building as Ryan stood
        in front both of you "I'm sorry that happened." you told her and before
        she could reply, Ryan took off running towards the building making you
        both quickly look back and that's when you heard it, a gunshot. So
        quickly Natalia went to stand in front of you unsure of the situation
        and you look out from behind her as you both watched what happened. The
        mother shot the guy that killed her son. Ryan wasn't quick enough to
        stop her. When he got there, the guy was already on the ground so you
        and Natalia made way towards them after the mother was apprehended.
        You stood a little distance away, looking on as Natalia went to stand
        next to Ryan as he was checking the guy, but it was too late. After
        being sorry that Ryan couldn’t stop it in time he remembered you and
        turned to see you were there standing looking on. So he got up and went
        over to you "You okay baby?" he asked taking hold of your face looking
        at you with concerned filled eyes so you nodded looking into his "I'm
        fine, it just startled me a bit." "I know." Ryan understood, because you
        don’t like sudden noises, because you get startled easily. After rubbing
        your cheek his hand dropped to capture yours "Looks like I'll be here a
        bit longer than intended." Ryan said referring to what just happened and
        you nodded "It's okay, I'll just run the errands and hang out at the
        café nearby and just wait for your call." Ryan smiled looking down at
        you hoping you were really fine but you squeezed his hand "I'll get
        going, and you head back. See you in a few." Ryan nodded before kissing
        your forehead "Okay, be safe." "Always." with that you left and Ryan
        watched making sure you got to the car safely before heading back to
        Natalia "Is Heather okay?" Natalia asked concerned for you "Yeah, just
        startled. But I'll ask her again later." Natalia nodded and they got
        back to work.

        Ryan called while you were waiting at the café, so you left and picked
        him up. Getting out as he made his way to the car "Want me to drive?"
        Ryan asked as he approached and you nodded getting in the passenger
        side. When he got in you both made for your way home, "Managed to get
        everything completed?" Ryan asked squeezing your thigh getting your
        attention and you just replied with a nod looking back out the window.
        From you being quiet the whole car ride, Ryan knew you weren't doing
        well. So the moment you guys got into the apartment and shoes were
        discarded Ryan took you into his arms engulfing you in a very comforting
        hug. You asked no questions but just accepted it and hugged him back
        because it's not something you knew you needed. You guys remained there
        for a moment before you pulled away to look at Ryan "Thank you." you
        smiled up at him "Always." he said hand reaching up to stroke your cheek
        "Want to talk about it?" Ryan asked and you thought for a moment "Well,
        I saw a man got killed before my eyes, but that's not the part that's
        bothering me." Ryan raised a brow surprised because that's what he
        thought was bothering you, seeing someone die. "Then what is, because I
        thought it was that?" you sighed before looking back up at him "It was
        the mother, and the pain she felt in that moment." Ryan listened as you
        talked "To lose a child and to see the person that took the child from
        you. And I just kept thinking, I felt like I would of done the same
        thing." Ryan was about to say something but you stopped him "I know,
        murder is wrong, but whatever she was feeling, I felt it." Ryan wasn't
        sure how to reply at the moment so he just held you back in his arms
        tightly, so sighing he finally said "I understand, but from a
        perspective of something happening to you and seeing the person that
        caused it, so I understand." he told you truthfully and you guys held
        each other some more before you chuckled and pulled away looking up at
        him "You have a tough job Ryan Wolfe, I don’t know how you do it." you
        said capturing his cheek in your left hand and he leaned into it "It is
        tough but knowing that I get to come home to you each day keeps me
        going." he told you sincerely smiling at you and that soften your heart
        but he continued "And now that you're nearer to me during the day, it
        settles my heart more and makes the job even more bearable." his words
        caused you to lean up and place a tender kiss on his lips "Well, I'm
        thankful that I'm able to help you through it." you said after pulling
        away offering him a smile "More than you know." he returned your smile
        "So besides that, you're okay?" you nodded "I'm okay." "Even after
        seeing two people get killed today?" you nodded "Even after that, I've
        watched gory real life documentaries and those do nothing to me, so
        today was nothing." Ryan gave you a skeptic look "Maybe you're a
        psycho." Ryan said unwrapping his arms from around you moving away
        "That's why you should never anger me." you gave him an evil look and
        Ryan broke out in laughter "What was that supposed to be?" "A threat
        with an evil look?" you said, more like questioned and Ryan just laughed
        "Babe, you're too cute for that." Ryan said capturing your face to
        squish your cheeks before planting a kiss on your lips "But nice try
        though. Next time, less cute, more evil looking." Ryan said teasing
        moving away from you "Ryan Wolfe, get back here and let me show you
        evil." you said chasing after him as he took off running from you.
