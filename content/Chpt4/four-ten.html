            "For someone that doesn't like the colour pink, I must say, you do look mighty sexy in the colour." Ryan said as he entered the bedroom seeing you standing in front the dresser "Is it too sexy for work, cause then I'll have to change?" you asked turning towards him and he shook his head "As your co-worker, no it's not too sexy for work and it's professional but, as your husband, it is very sexy." Ryan said approaching, confusing you even more "Come on Ryan, a real answer." he shrugged "I'm serious, that was a real answer. You don't look unprofessional, at all." you nodded taking his word "Okay, thank you." you said smiling and Ryan took hold of your hips "Is it weird that seeing you in pink turns me on, like more than usual?" you chuckled "Would you be able to keep it in your pants for the whole day CSI Wolfe, I don't want you being unprofessional." Ryan gave you a smirk "How about you help me get it out my system?" he raised a brow hopefully, so you checked your watch "Well I am pretty early." Ryan's grip on your hips tightened "Please say yes." Ryan pleaded leaning forward to place kisses in your neck, so you giggled and caved in "Okay okay." with your reply he wasted no time in crashing his lips against yours.

            You both managed to get work in time although you indulged Ryan in his ways. The locker room is where you both parted ways cause Ryan got called out to a scene and you were needed for a different case in the lab. The day was going along smoothly and you haven't managed to see Ryan for the morning because he was working a different case, but a part of you hoped to catch a glimpse of him because how Ryan dressed this morning left you craving to see him. You just loved when he wore these particular kind dress pants with a sweater or t-shirt, it just does something to you. It's honestly a personal favourite look of yours.

            So while in the lab on the computer in the front, you heard talking voices entered into the lab behind you, but you were focused on task at hand to register said voices on who they were. "Hey Heather." it's only until you heard your name that you took noticed and turned to see it was Calleigh that called for you and Ryan was beside her "Hey, sorry for not hearing you guys, was caught up." you smiled coming towards them "It's okay babe." Ryan reassured "Working on a different case?" Ryan asked gesturing to the computer you were at "Yeah, my expertise were needed more on this one, but still, if you need any help." you said "We know who to call." Calleigh said smiling "You got it." you said before going back to your computer as they turned to theirs getting to work as well. So blocking them out again you focused back on what you were doing before they entered. But Ryan got distracted by the way you looked in your dress, it was just something about watching you work that he couldn't help but stare. Calleigh was discussing something and asked Ryan a question, but realizing she wasn't getting a reply, she called his name looking towards him, and saw that he wasn't pay attention so following his line of sight, she realized that he was watching you work. Smiling to herself and shaking her head she reached up and snapped her fingers in front his face capturing his attention making him look towards her. "What?" Ryan asked and Calleigh laughed "You could not be more obvious." "What are you talking about?" Ryan asked truly confused "I was talking to you and asked you a question but you clearly heard nothing I said, because…" Calleigh said then gestured towards your working figure and she saw Ryan's ears turned red while he scratched the back of his neck because he realized what she meant "I was just looking at her." "You were more than looking, you weren't with me anymore." Calleigh said chuckling, and before Ryan could of said anything, they heard movement coming from you, you took up the tablet, uploading the info you want to it, before moving away from the computer with tablet in hand "You guys getting through okay?" you asked approaching them coming to stand beside the table screen "Was just experiencing a little distraction." Calleigh said trying to hide her smile and Ryan sighed but you didn't catch on "So you need my help?" you asked innocently and Ryan shook his head before replying "No, uh, we got it covered." he offered a smile to you, which you returned "You both are acting weird, but okay…." you said looking between the two of them "I gotta deliver some info, so I'll be back, to help if needed." you said starting to move away from the desk after squeezing Ryans' bicep "Or you can just call." you said leaving "Will do." Calleigh said and with that you left, but she watched Ryan as he watched you walk away until you were out of sight, then she just released a laugh "And he said he isn't obvious." she said turning back to the screen "I'm not." "Come on Ryan, it's okay, you're very attracted to your wife and that's normal, but tone it down, because one Rick is an awful guy and you know this, and two, you wouldn't want Heather to get in trouble." Ryan nodded "Okay. You're right. I'm sorry" "Good. Be subtle like Heather, where it isn't obvious, that she checks you out." that made Ryan whip his head towards Calleigh "Like Heather?" now Ryan wanted to know and Calleigh sighed "That's a conversation for later, but right now we really have work to do and let's get it done before Heather comes back because I'm afraid we'll never leave here." Calleigh chuckled and Ryan agreed so they finally got to work.

            It was the end of the work day and both your shifts were over. Ryan was first in the locker room before you and he was talking to Calleigh and she was explaining how you're more subtle "Just like that." you and Eric heard Calleigh say as you both entered the locker room, cause you guys left the floor above at the same time and decided to walk together "Just like what?" Eric asked as you both entered heading towards your respective lockers. Ryan gave Calleigh a look not to say anything but she just laughed "We’re all friends here. I was telling Ryan how to be not so obvious when looking at Heather." that made you and Eric laugh while Ryan sighed "Good luck with that one." you said going through your locker "Come on, I'm not that bad." "Yes Wolfe, you are that bad." Eric replied putting in his comment "I think he'll heed my advice." you turned as Calleigh said that "I've been trying for years Calleigh, and I've given up." "Guys, Wolfe is just madly in love with his wife, and it's hard for him to hide it. I think it's sweet." you all looked towards Eric and Ryan enjoyed that response "Thank you Eric. For understanding." Ryan said with the widest of smiles "For understanding what?" Now it was Natalia's turn to enter the locker room and the conversation. You laughed, retrieving your bag and closing your locker, and before anyone had time to say anything, Ryan interceded "Good work today guys, I wish I could stay chatting but Heather and I have a date." Ryan said closing his locker with bag in hand reaching out for you with his free one tugging you along "What am I missing?" Natalia asked super confused and you just laughed as you were tugged along "They will fill you in, bye guys, tomorrow." they all threw their byes towards you laughing as you were pulled out the room.

            In the car now, as Ryan started to drive away "We have a date?" you asked turning your head to him "No, just wanted to leave. I was being grilled." you pouted at his reply "I was looking forward to this date." he quickly looked towards you, and your facial expression softened his heart "I guess we can go out. Food or ice cream?" Ryan asked bringing his hand to your lap capturing yours "Ice cream, it's been a while we went to the Miami Chill, let's go there." Ryan nodded "Then it's a date."

            Entering the parlor, the bells jingled above and you guys went to your usual booth in the back and sat. "It really has been a while." Ryan said the moment he sat down, you agreed before picking up the menu "I wonder if they have anything new?" you said looking over the menu and Ryan did the same. So you both looked over and made your choices for when the waitress comes and collect your orders. The wait wasn't long and the ice creams were placed in front you both with an 'Enjoy'. While eating your ice cream, Ryan asked you about the case you were working on today and you asked about his. When he was finished explaining you felt like being a tease, so taking off your heel, you reached forward and ran your foot along his calf "So.. I heard from someone today, that my husband couldn’t take his eyes off of me." Ryan almost choked on his ice cream when he felt your foot. "Ignore what Calleigh said." Ryan said composing himself but you shook your head "It wasn't her." so his eyes widened "Then who was it?" "Eric. While we were coming down to the locker room he told me about it." you giggled eating more of your ice cream. "It was the dress, wasn't it?" you asked staring directly at him but he just shrugged trying to keep himself calm because your foot was going higher up his leg "But I thought I helped you get it out your system this morning?" you asked crooking your head to the side. Ryan looked around making sure no one was near before leaning towards you "Maybe it wasn't enough." his reply made you gasp "Are you saying I'm incapable of satisfying my husband?" you asked, foot reaching his thigh now "Now, I didn't say that." Ryan said pointedly, as your foot went higher "Well, it sounded like you implied it." right after you said those words you removed your foot just as it was about to reach where Ryan wanted you to touch him most causing him to internally groan "Come on baby, don't be a tease." so you shrugged "Then you shouldn't have implied that I didn't satisfy you enough." you continued eating your ice cream like normal and Ryan chuckled "Now you're putting words in my mouth." you crocked your head to the side "Did I really?" Ryan nodded so you just thought for a moment deciding to remain quiet. Ryan caught on to your silence and raised a brow "Not saying anything?" you shook your head, eating the last of your ice cream. "I rather show you how capable I am of satisfying my husband." you said before getting up with your purse in hand. Ryan watched has you headed off to the counter up front. Being entranced by you and your words, ice cream forgotten he got up and joined you. He saw that you just paid for the bill before taking his hand as he approached you. He watched as you thanked the worker before pulling him out the door. "Is this how I die?" Ryan asked as you both walk to the car and you shrugged replying "Maybe.". Little did Ryan know that, that night you're going to make him regret for saying those words and prove to him that in fact you are way more than capable at satisfying him.
