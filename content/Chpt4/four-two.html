            Life was starting to look up for Ryan, he was on his way to getting you back and H called him to ask about a job that would help with his reinstatement, and he did not hesitate to accept it. Ryan was more in the spotlight than he was accustom to, getting his picture taken constantly and it circling all over the web, but anything to get his life back he'll do it.

            You were tasked with finding out any information on Candace, the girlfriend of the victim, and as you were doing such, Eric came in "Hey Heather." "Hey Eric." you said and he came to stand beside you "So you're the smart one, what do you have for me?" you chuckled "Well, this girl is like crazy popular so it's taking way longer than usual to find what we need." you told Eric "So what do we know so far about her?" Eric asked and you told him what you found out so far "I'll give you a call when we get what we need." "Thanks Heather." with that Eric left, leaving you still sifting through the photos. A while went by before you called Eric and he came back "So what do you got?" you showed him "Nice work." "Thanks, but it's being updated constantly with new photos. Let's check out these ones." you said pulling them up and it was multiple photos of Ryan with the girl but it's the caption that made you and Eric laugh out "Spotted with a cute older guy." Eric read part of the caption, you both just found it funny "I guess this is what he's doing now." "Yeah, H put him as her body guard till we catch the killer." "Well I hope he's going to be okay." Eric heard the concern in your voice, you he leaned forward and rest a hand on your shoulder "Don't worry, Wolfe knows how to take care himself, he'll be good." you didn’t know the reassurance was something that you definitely needed "Thanks Eric." "Of course." you both turned back to inspecting the photos "What about that one right there?" Eric asked pointing to a close up photo of Candace "This one is definitely different. If you look at the person hands, they didn’t take it, so it had to be maybe something they were wearing." you pointed out pulling up the photo "Yeah, like glasses." you and Eric shared a look before he thanked you and left. He went to Alexx to retrieve the belongings from the victim, hoping to find the glasses and he was lucky, so returning back to you, he asked if you could recover the footage from the glasses "Well I am a genius." you chuckled "That's what I like to hear." he smiled and passed off the glasses to you as you got to work, and it wasn't long before you guys were watching what they contained.

            You were still online looking through the photos for anything that could help with the case when a voice pulled you away from the screen "Mrs. Wolfe." you looked towards the voice and saw Horatio standing there before making his way towards you with a smile "Hey Lieutenant, how may I be of service?" you asked as he stood next to you "Apparently I'm being surveillanced and I want you to find out what you can." "Is this related to Candace?" H nodded "Okay sir, I'm on it. I'll let you know what I find." he sent you a smile "Thanks hun." and with that he left, so you wasted no time in digging up whatever you could find, so searching the website you made sure to look over everything that contained H. It wasn't long before you found something that worried you, so pulling up the info on your tablet, you went in search for him. You managed to quickly find him "Horatio." your voice made him look up as you guys walked towards each other "What did you find?" "This disturbing message." you said showing the tablet "Horatio Caine dies today." H said reading aloud "You should be careful Lieutenant, incase it's real." "Then I'll be ready." he gave a nod before leaving.

            While Ryan was out protecting the girl, he got tackled by an assailant, so thinking quick he tried to gather DNA through the fight before returning back to the girl. This resulted in him sitting in an interrogation room waiting for someone to come and collect the DNA from him. Calleigh came to do the job but Eric tagged along, just to make sure that he was okay, plus he was there on behalf of you, although you don't know it. They bantered back and forth all light heartedly "I just wanted to make sure you were okay." Eric told him "Well isn't that sweet of you." Ryan retorted back "Plus, I came on behalf of Heather, cause I know she'll see the photos of you and get worried, so I wanted to see for myself, to reassure her." Ryan's eyes widen "She's working on the case?" both Calleigh and Eric nodded "Yeah, and she has truly been massive help. A perfect addition to the team." Eric said and that made Ryan smile "That's great. I'm very proud of her." "You should be." Calleigh said giving Ryan a look and Ryan sighed "I know I know, but I'm working on it." they talked some more before they parted ways.

            You heard your phone ringing so you answered it without checking the caller, cause you were busy with something on the screen "This is Heather Wolfe." you said into the receiver "Mrs. Wolfe, has anything new been posted on me?" H asked "Let me check." you made quick work and saw nothing "No sir." "Okay, well there is something I would like you post." "What are you thinking?" "I'm going to send you my location and a photo, and I need you to post that to the site for me." "You got it sir." "Thank you." "And Lieutenant be careful." you said with worry and you heard him smile "Always." with that you both hung up.

            The day was over and you could not wait to get into the warmth of your bed, so leaving the building, you got in your car and made for your temporary home. Unlocking the door, you released a huge sigh, quickly taking off your shoes and resting down your bags, and made a beeline for the bedroom. Reaching the bed you plopped down heavily and bounced a little but the moment your body stopped, the relaxation came over you instantly. You managed to enjoy that quiet for ten minutes before you heard your phone ring. Taking it from your pocket you checked the ID and saw that it was Ryan, that instantly brought a smile to your face, so you answered with a "Well hello you." you placed it on speaker resting the phone on the bed as you continued laying on your front "Hey, you sound tired." "I am, I just got in." "Same here, how was work, I heard you worked on the case today?" you smiled "Are you spying on me Ryan?" and he chuckled "No, I just came by the station and Delko told me." "Yeah I heard, and I saw what happened. You're okay right?" "Yeah, nothing I couldn’t handle." that made you chuckled "Well I'm glad you're okay, those videos weren't fun to watch." "I'm sorry you had to witness that." "So how did this happen, the body guard job?" You asked and Ryan explained it all to you "So you're really making progress." "Of course, whatever must be done to get my wife back." you smiled "Aren't you sweet." "That I am. I wanted to ask, what is it like working at the lab?" you smiled "It's really nice. The people are amazing, the interface is working perfectly, I still can't believe I did that. It feels good the help out the team, and hang with them. The best part is that I got to see a glimpse into the look of your work life. It's really cool." Ryan couldn't stop smiling, cause he knew you were happy "That's really great. I'm truly happy for you because you deserve it." you guys chatted for some more and Ryan asked you out to dinner tomorrow night which you accepted "Good night beautiful. I love you and I miss you." you giggled "I love and miss you too Ryan, good night." you heard him sent you a kiss that made you laugh "I think that's the first time I ever heard you do that." "Not a fan?" Ryan asked worried "No no, I am a fan, don't worry. It's nice." you told him truthfully and that only encouraged him to do it plenty more. Instead of actually hanging up after the good nights, you guys continued talking a hour or two more.
