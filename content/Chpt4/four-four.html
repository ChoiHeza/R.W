        You and Ryan made plans to have breakfast that morning at a nice
        restaurant by the beach. He managed to get there before you because when
        you entered, you saw he was already seated. Ryan saw you approaching and
        stood up to pull out your chair for you "Hey, thanks for coming."Ryan
        said as you sat down and he pushed the chair in for you "Sure, we did
        make plans together." you chuckled and watched as Ryan sat back down.
        "You look beautiful." he said giving you a smile "You don't look too bad
        yourself, love the colour." you said pointing to his shirt and Ryan
        chuckled "Well, I said why not put in some effort for my wife, anything
        to get back in her good books." you laughed at that "Smooth." before the
        convo could continue a waiter came by to take your order. "Thanks." you
        said as the waiter left "So what's new?" you asked and Ryan updated on
        his progress, he wasn't working for the defense anymore and things were
        tough, but he still had the gun range job "While working there, I was
        thinking, maybe you should come by and learn how to shoot." Ryan
        suggested hopefully, you thought for a moment "The thought did cross my
        mind, maybe I should." Ryan eyes lit up at that and you guys continued
        talking till the breakfast arrived and you both ate and enjoyed each
        other company. Before you know it, it was time to head off to work "I
        didn't even realize the time, I have to get to the lab." you said
        checking your watch before getting up "I was thinking about going by the
        department as well." Ryan said getting up as well. "Yeah, what for?"
        "Was thinking about asking Alexx for a job." "To work in autopsy?" Ryan
        nodded as you both started to leave "I have the experience and I'm
        qualified." "Sounds like a plus so far." you guys walked out and Ryan
        walked you to your car "Well Ryan, breakfast was lovely, thank you." you
        said before leaning forward to give him a kiss "And also good luck." the
        kiss caught Ryan off guard but he gladly accepted it as you starting to
        trust him back. "Thanks, I need it." he offered a smile still in bliss,
        you patted his cheek before getting into your car and Ryan left to go to
        his.

        Ryan entered the morgue and the sound of the door made Alexx look
        towards his direction "Hey." "Hey baby, look at you, new suit. You
        either just came from a fancy date or you have a job interview." Ryan
        chuckled "Well, I just came from a breakfast date with Heather and I
        actually have a job interview, hopefully with you." they got to talking
        but Alexx said she doesn't have the budget for it, but Ryan pleaded and
        said how much he missed them, so she said that she will think about it.
        But she discovered something from the body so Ryan had to quickly leave.

        You were in the lab, looking for information, pertaining to the current
        case the CSI team were working on, and Cooper was supposed to join you,
        you only managed to meet him twice but you guys never talked before.
        "Hey, Heather right?" you heard a voice and turned to see it was Cooper
        "Hey, that's me." you said with an outstretched hand "Cooper." he
        introduced and you both shook hands. Cooper kept a smile on his face and
        would not stop staring at you "Is something on my face?" you asked
        releasing his hand "Sorry no, you're just really beautiful." he said and
        you sent him a smile "Thank you." with that you turned back to the
        screen ready to get to work "So we're supposed to be getting credit info
        that can be useful and help us see with what we're dealing with." he
        stood next to you "You got it." while working he kept asking you
        questions "So did you really build this program?" you smiled proudly
        "That I did." "Wow, I'm truly impressed, when I first heard of a new
        computer tech that moved in and is apparently smarter than me, I refused
        to believe it." "So now after seeing for yourself, do you believe?" you
        asked him curious but mostly for Ryan's sake because he never really
        liked Cooper and always wanted to show him up "Yeah, I do believe,
        because I don't think I could ever build something or even do something
        like this." he said gesturing to everything. "Well thank you, hard work
        pays off." you said before turning back to the screen "It surely does."
        he said before continuing work. Cooper kept stealing glances at you from
        time to time. He saw the wedding bands on your finger but from
        experience, he knew most women wear them just so guys won't ask them
        out, but Cooper still wanted to take a shot because he couldn't get over
        how beautiful you were. He did ask Delko about you and he said you were
        off limits but Cooper refuses to adhere to that cause Delko can't keep
        getting all the ladies for himself. "Hey, can I ask you something?"
        Cooper asked turning to you "Sure, what is it?" "I was wondering if I
        can ask you out on a date sometime?" you heard the nervousness in his
        voice so you turned to look at him and raised your hand "I'm married."
        you said showing him the rings "Yeah I saw that, but I've known plenty
        of women that wore them just so they weren't asked out." you chuckled
        "Well, mines are real, and so is my husband." then Cooper got to
        thinking and remembered what Delko told him "Wait, is it Delko?" you
        laughed now "Me and Eric, gosh no, what made you think that?" "Cause I
        asked him about you and he said you were off limits." you smiled at that
        "Well it's not Eric." you said and showed him your badge and he read
        your full name then his face entered a state of realization "You're
        married to Ryan?" you nodded "Yeah." you said dropping your badge before
        going back to work "I'm so sorry, if I knew I wouldn't have." you waved
        him off "It's okay, was a misunderstanding." you chuckled but mostly to
        yourself because you know Ryan would love to hear about this, so you and
        Cooper returned back to work getting the info before getting Calleigh to
        show her what you guys found.

      <p class="story">
        The day ended and you found out that Cooper did something very
        unforgivable, he was using Tim Speedle's credit card, and you wondered
        how he could of done something like that. After that you just lost all
        respect for him and hoped you never had to meet him again. So you
        quickly got home and called Ryan wanting to tell him about Cooper, cause
        you know that's going to make his day. "If it isn't my beautiful wife
        choosing to grace me with her presence." you giggled at that "Flattery
        will get you nowhere, but I call to gossip with my husband about a
        certain someone." "Okay okay, you've caught my attention. Who is this
        certain someone?" "Dan Cooper." Ryan could hear the smile in your voice
        and instantly got an idea to what it was "He asked you out didn't he?"
        you chuckled "Wait, let me tell you it properly, don't rush." you said
        putting the phone on speaker so you could move around "Well I am all
        ears beautiful." Ryan made sure to get comfortable because he wants to
        hear this. You got straight into the story and spared him no details and
        Ryan was having the time of his life, he never fancied Cooper and always
        wanted to put him in his place but you did it for him and Ryan couldnâ€™t
        have been more happy. After talking about Cooper, you guys proceeded to
        talk about your day and from one topic to another.
