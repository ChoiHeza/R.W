            The day start off as any usual work day, minus the replacement M.E. for Alexx being killed, which was very unfortunate. So while looking down from the floor where the victim was pushed, Ryan made a comment "It's like a war zone down there." he said to Natalia cause she was processing the scene with him. They talked about how tragic it was for the M.E.. "You know, there's not enough money in the world to pay Heather to stand where I currently am." Ryan chuckled and Natalia looked up at him from her crouched position "She's afraid of heights?" "You wouldn't believe. I remembered when we were first dating, I suddenly lifted her up out the blue and she screamed and nearly passed out. I thought I hurt her or something. But then she explained she hates her feet leaving the ground, and being up high." Ryan said chuckling at the memory, Natalia laughed along "Is it still that bad now?" she asked and Ryan shook his head "I can lift her safely now, cause I assumed she's accustom to it, but stuff like this.." Ryan said gesturing to how high up they are "She would still freak out." Natalia smiled at that "I think it's cute." Ryan raised a brow "I feel like something happened between you two while Heather and I were separated." and Natalia just shrugged her shoulders and pointed out some evidence before Ryan could continue "There's some blood here." she said getting ready to swab it and Ryan immediately re-entered work mode.

            You were in your lab when you got the notice of the fire, but was told that everything was under control so you got back to work. It was only until you heard it was Calleigh that you went to check up on her, but just when you were about to enter you saw she was there sitting with Eric as he held her hands offering comfort, so smiling to yourself at the cute interaction you turned away not wanting to disturb and thought to yourself 'We will have words later CSI Delko.'. Shaking your head with a smile, you headed back to your lab and continued working on the case. While there Ryan entered, he just came from speaking with Horatio of a plan he has and told Ryan to forward it to you. "Hey babe." Ryan said approaching you, "Hey you." you said smiling as he came to stand next to you "Came to collect the info?" he shook his head then entered a whisper mode "There's something I need to talk to you about." he sounded very serious so nodding you turned to him "No, don't look at me, keep looking at the screen, and pretend we're working together on the case." you followed orders "What is it?" Ryan looked around to make sure you guys were alone before starting "H is planning on faking his death, to draw out Julia's husband, so we have to make it believable." he continued and you listened pretending to be working "Okay, so who's in on it?" "Me, you, the sniper guy and the new M.E., no one else can know." "Okay, and what does he want me to do?" you turned quick to look at Ryan before turning back "Get the word out that H is dead. But so it won't raise suspicions, someone is supposed to come and kill him but we're going to beat them to it. So his hope is that the guy they sent, will take a picture and post it. That's where you come in, when you see that post, spread it, but targeting mostly the ones he wants to see it." you nodded, understanding with a smile "The bad guys." "Exactly, the bad guys." you went over the part of the plan in the end "Okay, I can do that so it won't be traced back to the lab. So when will I know?" you asked looking at Ryan now and he looked back to you "I'll call." you nodded he raised his hand just above the desk in a fist bump and you chuckled, connecting yours with his. "Don't we make a good team." "Of course. I gotta go, look out for me." Ryan said offering you a smile "I will, be careful." "Always." he said with a wink before tapping your lower back and leaving.

            Ryan was in an interrogation with Calleigh when he checked his watch and saw it was time to meet H. Telling her that he has to go, something came up, he dismissed himself and started to make his way out. Before leaving he made sure to walk pass your lab and knocked the glass to capture your attention, looking up you saw it was him and he gave a nod signally it's starting and you nodded back to let him know you got the message. You mouthed a 'I love you' and he smiled mouthing back 'and I love you.' you guys shared a quick smile before looking away from each other. So you continued back your work just waiting for the call from Ryan for when it's time for you to shine. About two hours passed before your phone rang, and you saw it was Ryan "Hey." "It's done." he said "Got it." you said before hanging up and getting to work. Searching for the golden image that someone would have posted for you to spread. It didn’t take long before you got the image you were looking for and spread it where H wanted it to go, and who he wanted to see it, cause in order for the plan to work, they have to think he's dead, really dead. Meanwhile Ryan was wrapping things on his end making sure no one else finds out that his death was fake, let's just say the team was not pleased and they were very suspicious of Ryan except Natalia, she believed in him.

            You just left your lab and saw Calleigh and Eric enter, you didn't cross paths so they didn’t see you. While walking down the hall not far from the lab you saw Ryan and he gestured for you, approaching, making sure the coast was clear, Ryan started talking "Got it done?" you smiled "It's like you're asking if I know what is one plus one." Ryan chuckled at your reply "And it reached where it was needed?" you nodded pulling up your tablet showing him "Wow. This is impressive." he said before giving you a proud smile "Not to toot my own horn but I'm a genius." Ryan was about to reply but his cell rang "This is Wolfe." he said answering into the phone, but no reply came, because there wasn't a need. When you saw Eric and Calleigh enter your lab, they were going to trace the number the shooter texted 'it's done', finding it, they called the number and Ryan's voice came through. So hearing his voice outside the room, they looked around saw him on his phone, while standing with you in the hallway. Wasting no time, they both angrily approached you both, so acting out of defense Ryan moved to stand in front of you as Eric first approached him "It all makes sense now! How you got there so fast, why you released the body!" Eric was pissed but Ryan wanted to calm the situation before it got worse "Now, I want you to relax, this is not how it looks." Ryan said raising his hands in defense and you just watched on for now "Really, because it looks like you and Codwall was responsible for Horatio's murder." Calleigh said matching Eric's anger then Calleigh turned to you, eyes softening not wanting to think that you were a part of it as well and Ryan caught on to her thoughts so he quickly shut it down, cause he was going to allow no one to point fingers at you "Really!? Cause you're wrong." he stated but Calleigh wasn't buying it, neither of them was "He texted you 'it's done'." she said "Yeah, and what does 'it's done' mean Wolfe?" Eric asked still not happy about the situation "I was following orders." Ryan sighed but Eric was losing his patience "Orders from who Wolfe?" Ryan was contemplating if to tell the truth so he quickly looked at you before looking back to Eric and before he had a chance to say anything Eric attacked him "Orders from who Wolfe!?" he shouted grabbing Ryan by his jacket. Eric kept shouting and you figured it was time to step in, cause no matter the person, they can't touch your husband like that "You calm down and let him go." you said pushing yourself between the two causing Eric to let go and you were now standing in front of Ryan looking up at him "I get it, you're angry, but let Ryan explain himself, or have you both lost faith in him." you said looking between Eric and Calleigh getting annoyed yourself, Ryan was going to protest but you stopped him by raising your hand. Ryan knows not to interfere when you're mad. Looking between you and Ryan, Calleigh and Eric sighed before calming down "So who did the orders came from?" Calleigh asked this time less annoyed "From Horatio." Ryan stated but you dare not move from in front of him, cause Eric could attack again "I don't believe anything you're saying." she said in denial and Eric started to move around you to get back to Ryan but you moved with him "I don't want to hurt you Heather, it's just your husband I want." he said with venom in his voice "Then you hurt me to get to him." you said matching his voice looking up at him standing your ground, cause no one lays a finger on your man and gets away with it. So sighing Eric looked up at Ryan "Tell us what you know." Eric said causing both you and Ryan to share a look "It's up to you." you said and Ryan sighed moving to your side to be closer to Eric and Calleigh "He's alive." Ryan whispered "What?" Calleigh asked in disbelief, so turning to make sure no one was around in hearing distance, Ryan turned back to explain "Horatio's alive." then he got into explaining the plan and the parts that the others played "I was responsible for the blood, that's why I left the interrogation room early, and Heather was responsible for spreading the news to who H wanted to know that he was dead, but she knew of nothing else, just to spread the news. So if you want to come at us for keeping a secret, then come at me, leave her out of it" Ryan said sternly at the end but Eric and Calleigh couldn't believe it, they were honestly relieved that Horatio was alive "So where is Horatio now?" Eric asked concerned "He could be anywhere." Ryan said truthfully but Calleigh and Eric looked at you both and apologized "It's okay, you guys were just following evidence." Ryan said cause he knew they were just doing their jobs.

            Back to work but Horatio still being 'dead' some people still needed to be found. You and Ryan were currently in your lab at the surface computer checking some traffic data that H wanted you guys to look at "You know, that was kind of hot, what you did back there." Ryan stated making you turn to look at him "What did I do exactly?" you said searching the database "When you took my defense so Eric wouldn't attack me." Ryan said smiling down at you and that caused your cheeks to heat up so you chuckled "I just don't like people mishandling what's mine." you said avoiding Ryan's gaze and you swore you heard him groan "Would it be wrong if I suddenly bent you over this desk?" his question made you gasp looking around to make sure the room was empty before looking at him "Ryan Wolfe, we're at work." and Ryan chuckled "Sadly." you smacked his chest with the back of your hand causing him to laugh "Shameless you are, but yes it would be very wrong. Well, it would feel very good, but we would definitely lose our jobs." you said sending him a wink which caused him to bite his lip "Why is work not over, I want to have you already." "Keep it in your pants handsome. We're soon there." you teased, quickly brushing your fingers along his, and Ryan was doing everything in his power to not take you then and there, but his thoughts were disturbed when Calleigh entered the lab "Is this the traffic light Horatio wanted us to check into?" she asked coming to stand next to you "Yup. From the armored car robbery." Ryan said immediately getting into work mode not wanting to draw suspicions and you had to bite back a smile at his actions.

            Ryan came to a conclusion on something to track Ortega, so after discussing it with Delko, they both headed towards your direction "Hello beautiful wife." Ryan said entering making you look up from your screen "Hey boys." they both greeted you with a smile "Don't mind us, just came to track someone." Eric said as they both went to the computer behind you "You got it." you said turning back to work and they got to theirs. After putting on the phone, and the contacts coming out on the screen Eric asked Ryan if he could put it on the big screen, so swiping up, it displayed on the big screen and through the projection Ryan caught a glimpse of you, slightly bending over your computer. He watched you forgetting all about what they came here to do, head titling slightly to the side. When Eric realized Ryan paused he looked at him and saw that Ryan was checking you out so Eric laughed getting both you and Ryan's attention. Ryan quickly snapped out of it and you looked back towards them "What's funny?" you asked smiling innocently and Eric shook his head "I just remembered something." he said giving Ryan a smug look which caused Ryan to swallow scratching the back of his head cause he got caught. So chuckling you turned back to your screen "If you say so hun." you got back to work ignoring the two behind you "And at work?" Eric said softly and shook his head "I don't know what you're talking about." Ryan said turning back to the screen looking for the contact "Really now? You were practically just now undressing her with your eyes." Eric chuckled and Ryan gave him a look to be quiet "Not a word." he said with a pointed finger and Eric raised his hands in defense with a smirk before getting back to work.

            You and Eric were first in the locker room at the end of your shift "I'm really sorry about what happened today." Eric said closing his locker turning to look at you "What do you mean?" you asked doing the same "When I confronted you guys, and attacked Ryan. I'm really sorry." you waved him off "You were just doing your job, we always follow the evidence. Plus I wouldn't allow you to touch him while I was there." you said with folded arms smugly and Eric chuckled "I realized, you can be pretty tough, can't you." you nodded "I'm the kind of wife that would fight the guy that's fighting their husband. No matter my size, I would jump in cause no one messes with what's mine." Eric laughed and you joined "I'm serious." you told him and he nodded "I know you are, I saw it myself today. The look you gave sent chills down my spine. I would hate to be the person at the end of those stares." Eric said shivering remembering the memory "I'm sorry, was just protecting what's mine." "It's okay, I would of done the same." when he said that a grin made its way to your face "For Calleigh?" you said wiggling your eyebrows causing Eric to look nervous "Maybe." he said not meeting your eyes and you internally squeal "You guys are killing me. You know, I saw you both today." your statement made Eric look up to you "When?" "After the lab incident with Calleigh, I went to check up on her but you were already there holding her hands and consoling her" you said throwing a 'I know' look his way causing him to laugh nervously "It was nothing." "Right…." you said not believing him one bit but before he had chance to defend himself came other voices "I'm starting to see what you meant Natalia, they're always together talking." Ryan said as he entered the room with Natalia and Calleigh causing both you and Eric to laugh "I'm sorry Wolfe, but I'm slowly taking her from you." Eric joked causing everyone to laugh so you faked gasped "How could you tell them our secrets?" you said joking along and Natalia also decided to join in "Eric, you should of come to me first, you know I had my eyes set on Heather." you didn't expect that so you laughed and Ryan pointed towards Natalia "Now that one, I actually believe." "What are you talking about?" Calleigh asked fully invested "When we were separated, I think Natalia swooped in and took Heather from me." Ryan said with narrowed eyes so you walked over to Natalia smiling "Ryan, you can't claim something that wasn't yours." Natalia remarked back smiling down at you and you turned to Ryan with a wink "What can I say, she's clearly my type." you all shared laughs now, and that's how the remainder of the time in the locker room went, you guys joking around before leaving for the day.

            Coming in through your apartment and the moment shoes and bags were discarded Ryan had you captured with his "I didn't know my wife was wanted by so many." Ryan said causing you too chuckle "What can I say, I'm pretty lovable." you said bringing your hands up to play with the hair at the back of his head "I'm not going to deny that, but you are also, gorgeous.." he started by going to your neck, placing kisses "Beautiful.." kiss "Sexy.." kiss "Smart…" kiss "a genius" kiss "and mine." a kiss that was followed by a bite, before kissing over it and raising back his head to look at you "Is this you claiming me as yours?" you asked and Ryan leaned in to give you a short kiss "Maybe." his hands massaging your hips and waist now "So what is going through your mind right now Mr. Wolfe?" you asked hovering your lips over his "All the things I would love to do to you, just to show you that you're mine and I don't like sharing what's mine." he said trailing kisses from your lips to your neck "Does this also relate to what happened today, when I defended you?" you felt Ryan moaned in your neck sending vibrations through your body "I was turned on from that moment, and it not once left my mind." Ryan said bringing his hands lower to squeeze your bum before resting them on the back of your thighs "Jump." he commanded and you did as told, jumping and wrapping your legs around his torso as you clung onto his shoulders "Permission to indulge in my fantasies Mrs. Wolfe?" Ryan asked bringing his lips back to hover over yours just waiting for your response "I'm yours." you said and something broke in Ryan causing him to crash his lips against yours in a very heated kiss heading for the bedroom.
