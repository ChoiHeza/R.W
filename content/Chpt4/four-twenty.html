            You were passing by the questioned documents lab when you saw Ryan inside, so with a new destination in mind, you turned and entered the room. "Hello hello." came your voice making Ryan look back "Hey babe, what brings you here?" Ryan asked turning in his chair to look at you "Was just passing by and saw you." you said with a smile coming over to sit next to him "So what are you doing?" he turned back as you both looked at the screen "Listening to the 911 call that the victim placed." you nodded "Something was wrong with it?" "It just didn’t make any sense to me, based on how he was killed." "Okay, play it. Let's see what's up." Ryan nodded before pressing play and you both listened to it "Again." you suggested to confirm your suspicions. "Just as I suspected." you commented "What do you mean?" "The audio, it sounds altered." Ryan gave you a look "And how do you know that?" you chuckled "Our time spent apart, I had a lot of free time on my hands, since the project was completed so I took a sound design course." Ryan looked truly impressed. "So then the voice we're hearing here, might not be what the person actually sounds like?" you nodded as you stood up, "If you pass by my lab, I'll be able to help you decipher it, cause my program is capable." you chuckled and pride raised within Ryan at how smart you are "You got it, but first Calleigh has to hear it before I go over there." "Alright, see you in a bit then." you said as you left the room and Ryan nodded.

            Just as Ryan was entering your lab you were leaving with tablet in hand "I was just coming to get help with the audio." Ryan said as you both stood in the entry way "I'll be back now, just have to pass on some info. You can get started, or is that too much of a task for you?" you said with a raised brow teasing Ryan and he chuckled "I'm more than capable." you laughed moving away "Sounds like you don't need me then." but he turned and called to you "I still do!" with that you shook your head going where you need to and Ryan entered the lab getting started. It wasn't long before you returned "Do you know that you're shaking the beakers in the lab over the hall?" you said entering back going to stand next to Ryan "It's the vibrations. I'm trying to listen for any background noises that may be hidden since the voice maybe altered." Ryan said as he tried different frequencies. "What about the voice, did you find the original?" Ryan shook his head turning to you with a smile "I was waiting for you to do that." you chuckled and asked "Why?" "Because your smartself figured it out, so I want you to take credit for tuning it back." you grinned giving him a look "What?" he asked "You don't know how to do it, do you?" you asked and there was a moment before Ryan sighed shaking his head "No. I tried but realized, I had no clue where to start." you brought your hand up to rub his shoulder "It's okay baby, I'll show you." so while analyzing the evidence you showed Ryan how to do it for future situations and of course he was a very quick learner while being a flirt along the way. Just as you guys finished getting the original voice Calleigh entered and you guys discussed the progress.

            The day was over and some unfortunate things happened along the way, Calleigh being removed from the case, then Eric because the main suspect was playing dirty. "But I'm glad H tricked him in the end." you said after Ryan finished discuss the rest of the case with you. You both were currently on the sofa with the tv on in the background. Your feet were in Ryan's lap as he massaged your calves. "But I couldn't have imagined what would of happened it they weren't caught. All the recordings that they have on us. Like the one they used against Delko for blackmail." Ryan said looking towards you seriously "Well, you won't have to cause you guys got them." "I know but, that's some pretty secretive stuff." you leaned forward taking Ryan's hand in yours "Is there something you're afraid of, getting out?" Ryan nodded and was about to say something but you paused him "You know, whatever you and your therapist talked about you don't have to tell me. That's your personal time." you told him truthfully with a smile hand raising to grace his cheek "I know but, it's nothing you don’t know. But there was something I did talk about from time to time that I wanted you to know." you nodded for him to continue "My fear was, being a good husband for you. Knowing that I was gambling behind your back, when I should of just been honest cause you would of helped me through it but back a part of me didn't want to stop. It was addicting, so I guess that's why I never told you. And keeping that from you just made things worse. She always told me that based on how I talked about you, that you would have been understanding with the habit and patient, and I knew she was right. Cause that's the person you are, to me, you're perfect and why you chose to marry me, sometimes I still don't know why, because deep down a part of me always thought that you could of done better, or that one day you would realize it yourself and leave me." you listened as Ryan opened his heart to you and you weren't sure how to feel but you just knew that in this moment, you loved him, despite all his flaws, you would still choose him and marry him. So taking his face in your hands, you looked into his eyes "Ryan Wolfe, I love you and not once have I ever thought that you weren't good enough for me, not once have I not felt loved by you, not once have I ever wanted to trade this relationship for anything. I chose you and I'll keep choosing you, as long as I live." you said with a smile at the end and Ryan's heart swell "See, this is exactly what I mean. You're perfect." you chuckled "You know that's not true. I'm far from." Ryan shook his head "Well, from my eyes you are perfect." he said before kissing your nose causing you to giggle "But now I know that I'm capable of loving you, with everything that I am." you smiled wide "And that's all I ever felt from you. Was love." "Then I guess I am doing a very good job." you chuckled "The best." you said before pecking his lips "I love you Heather. I truly do." he said giving you a deep look "I know you do Ryan, and I never doubted it." you reassured him before connecting your lips with his "That makes me very happy." Ryan said smiling against your lips "You should be happy, you deserve it." you pulled away rubbing his cheeks "Thank you." "What for?" you asked tilting your head to the side "For loving me, for marrying me, for everything you've done." Ryan said sincerely pulling you closer to him "Well, there's nothing I rather else do." he smiled before pulling you back in for another kiss.
