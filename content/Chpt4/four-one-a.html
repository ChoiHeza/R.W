            Today was your wedding anniversary, so taking Natalia's advice from yesterday, it's the end of your shift so instead of going to your current abode, you decided to go home, where Ryan would be. It's going to be nothing special sadly, you just want to talk and see him. So getting in your car, you headed there, but decided to stop for some ice cream first. Ryan was finished with his shift at the gun range and was home pretty early. So entering the apartment, his heart still hurts that you aren't there to greet him, but it hurts more today due to it being your anniversary, so sighing, he took off his shoes and headed to the sofa dropping onto it. He took out his phone and pulled up your contact, finger hovering over the call button, contemplating if to call you or not. Well he does want to call you, he just doesn't know if you'll answer, so taking a chance because what more could he lose, he called your number and waited. It just went to voicemail, so sighing he hung up and tossed the phone aside, running his hands over his face, because he was hating himself so much right now. The reason you didn’t get to answer your phone was because it was in your handbag on silent as you quickly walked down the corridor to the apartment, because you wanted to pee badly. With keys already in hand, the moment you reached the door you wasted no time unlocking and rapidly making your way inside. Ryan from inside heard the noise and quickly got up. Entering you barely got time to pay Ryan attention as he came towards you "Hey." you quickly said taking off your shoes and resting down your stuff "Sorry, I really gotta pee." you pushed past Ryan and headed for the bathroom. Ryan stood there, phased, as to what was really happening, and that's where he remained until you returned. "You're still standing there?" you said coming back for your stuff. "I'm just confused." you chuckled "Well, it is our anniversary and I brought ice cream, so let's sit in the kitchen and talk, okay." Ryan nodded and followed you. Ryan sat first as he watched you move around the kitchen getting bowls and spoons, and it felt like you never left. Coming back to sit next to him you looked towards his direction after resting down the things. "Still not going to say anything?" you asked raising your brow, taking out the ice cream "I guess I'm just trying to figure out if this is a dream or not." that made you smile, "I'm real." he reached out and took your hand halting your actions "Can I?" Ryan asked gesturing to touching you and you nodded. He slowly brought his hand forward, reaching for your cheek, grazing it gently, before pushing a piece of hair behind your ear. Ryan just wanted to make sure this wasn't a dream he was having, because every time he would wake up and you would be gone. "See not a dream, I'm really here." you said sending a smile his way, which he returned, then dropped his hand. "Sorry." he apologized as you went back to serving the ice cream "Don't be. I bet you're wondering what I'm doing here?" Ryan chuckled "Something like that, not that I don't mind because it is your home too." "Well, I was originally going to just call and wish you happy anniversary, but I was advised to do otherwise, and I'm thankful I did." you said shooting a quick smile his way. "Here's your ice cream sir." you said giving Ryan his bowl. "Thanks, and I guess I am thankful for that person." "It was Natalia actually." Ryan's eyes shot up at that "You got to see her?" you nodded "Yeah, apparently after she came back from seeing you." Ryan sighed "So I heard you're working at a gun range." you looked towards him and Ryan avoided your eyes focusing on his ice cream "How is it?" Ryan shrugged before replying "Well, the pay isn't the best but it's better than nothing."  you nodded "Also I got your message. I miss you too." that made Ryan look up to you "She told you?" you nodded with a smile "Of course, I love her by the way. She asked me out on a date last night." you said wiggling your eye brows making Ryan laugh "A date, you've moved on already?" you chuckled and nodded "I did. She's gorgeous, and funny and we have a lot in common." you said placing your left hand on your chest to add to the flare and your ring finger caught Ryan's attention. "What's this?" he asked reaching for your hand, taking it in his and inspecting it "Are these my initials?" you sighed and hid your face and explained the story to him "So that's the tattoo that drunk you subconsciously picked?" you sighly nodded "No judging Ryan." and he just chuckled "I'm not, don't worry. I actually love it." the gesture truly made Ryan's heart swell because that meant you were still madly in love with him and wasn't going to leave him. "Maybe I should get a matching one." Ryan suggested and you raised a brow "You really would?" Ryan nodded "Of course, but that's only if you don’t want me to." you smiled "I don’t mind, I think it'll be cute." "Then it's settled, I'm getting it." Ryan said way too happily making you laugh. After finishing the ice cream and catching up it was time to be serious. "Let me start." Ryan said and you allowed him to explain, and he told you of all the progress that he's made, and that he's getting help, he's definitely changed and is doing everything in his power to get you back. You listened intently as he spoke and you heard the sincerity in his voice and knew that he is truly doing his best. Sighing you took his hand in yours "I know Ryan but it's still going to take a bit more time for me to trust you again." "I know, and I promise you that I'll earn it back. Whatever it takes." he squeezed your hand and you smiled "I know you will, I don't doubt it. Let's start working on it." Ryan eyes lit up "Like, getting back together?" you nodded "Yes, but taking it slow and see how it goes." "I could definitely do that, so that means we're back in contact with each other?" you nodded "So basically it's like I'm trying to win you over again, like before we started dating?" you chuckled "Yeah, I guess if you put it like that." "Well then that sounds perfect." you guys discussed some more about the arrangement and joked in between.

            You're at the door now ready to leave "You know, this is a nice look on you." you said reaching up your hand to run along Ryan's facial hair and he chuckled at it "Well, my job doesn't require me to look well-groomed and I guess I'm not well kept at the moment, it's rough." you gave him a sad smile, because you understood "Well I love it." you leaned forward and placed a kiss to his cheek which he accepted "Thank you." you leaned away and checked your watch "I gotta go, have to get to the lab early in the morning and there's some things I have to finish up tonight." Ryan nodded "It's okay, well get to your destination safely, and call or text when you get in." "I will." you guys shared one last hand squeeze "Happy anniversary Ryan Wolfe." you smiled up at him "And Happy anniversary Heather Wolfe." and with that you said your byes and was gone, smiles remaining on both your faces knowing that things will be back to how it was before you know it.
