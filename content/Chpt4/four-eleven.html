        With tablet in hand you entered back into your lab and saw that Calleigh
        and Eric were there, so you greeted each other before you headed to your
        computer getting back to work. The only sounds in the room came from
        Calleigh and Eric talking but that didn't last long because suddenly
        came a blaring noise like warning sirens. You looked back and realized
        that the noise came from their computer "What's happening?" you asked
        approaching them "Someone hacked into the laptop and is deleting the
        hard drive and I can't stop it." Eric said frantically typing away "Can
        you help Heather, we don't want to lose the info?" Calleigh asked and
        you wasted no time jumping into action after Eric moved aside. Whatever
        software the person was using was blocking out every command you gave
        "This isn't looking good, their software is pretty protected." so
        instead of trying to stop the deleting, you tried to ping the location
        that it came from. You three watched as the bar emptied signaling that
        the drive was wiped "Any luck?" Eric asked and you shook your head "No,
        but I did manage to get a location of who was interfering." you said
        displaying it on screen "Heather, you're a genius, thank you." Calleigh
        said offering you a big smile writing down the address "Thanks Heather,
        don't know what we would of done." Eric smiled and tapped your shoulder
        before they left.

        The day was over and you were in the locker room with Eric talking about
        his situation with Calleigh "I think they're still secretly seeing each
        other." Eric said and you sighed "I highly doubt it." you commented
        "Remember that time, when Calleigh got shot at, she met with him that
        morning to hang out." Eric said closing his locker turning to look at
        you "But that was weeks ago Eric and how that situation went down
        between them, I doubt they're together." Eric raised a brow at you to
        explain and you chuckled, but before you had a chance to, Ryan, Natalia
        and Calleigh entered the room so you and Eric shared a look that you'll
        continue this conversation another time. You all greeted each other as
        the others went to their lockers and you closed yours matching Eric by
        leaning against it. "Ryan, did you hear how amazing Heather was today?"
        Calleigh said turning to give you a smile before looking towards Ryan
        "But isn't she amazing every day?" Ryan commented causing Eric to groan
        and the rest of you laugh "What did she do?" Ryan asked seriously now
        and Calleigh explained what you did today for her and Eric "Really? I
        didn’t know you had hacking skills." Ryan said looking towards you and
        you shrugged "Comes with the job description." "It was pretty amazing to
        see. If she wasn't there, we wouldn't have gotten what we needed." "But
        I didn't stop the deletion." you said sighing "Yeah, but you found out
        who did it, and that's a win in my books." Calleigh said reassuring you
        "Thanks guys." you said giving them a smile "You know what's something I
        still can't wrap my head around?" Natalia said closing her locker
        "What's that?" Ryan asked closing his as well, leaning against it "How
        did you manage to get someone like Heather to marry you?" laughs were
        heard from everyone "Yes. The same thoughts were crossing my mind from
        the moment I met Heather." Eric commented laughing "So what's the secret
        Heather?" Natalia asked and everyone looked towards you and you became
        like a deer caught in head lights "You're asking me?" Natalia nodded
        "You are the one that married him." "Why are you guys making me sound
        like a bad guy?" Ryan commented "He's a really sweet guy, and he makes
        me feel very loved. He never ever lets me forget it." you said
        truthfully smiling towards Ryan and smiles erupted all around "Aww,
        that's really sweet." Natalia said with a wide smile looking at you guys
        "Yeah, Wolfe does has a sweet side. I've seen it myself." Eric said and
        everyone gave him looks probably thinking something completely different
        but he was quick to dismiss any thoughts that you all were forming "What
        I meant was, the first time I got to meet Heather, she invited me for
        dinner and I saw how he was around her, a completely different person,
        or as I should put it, a husband that's obsessed with his wife." that
        caused you all to laugh and Ryan just sighed "It's funny because you
        guys always point out how obsessed Ryan is with Heather, but I never
        realized anything until I found out he was married." Natalia commented
        "Well, besides being obsessed, he is great at keeping her a secret if
        you don't know." Eric commented and it was true cause he never wanted
        you to enter harms' way. "But now that I think about it, I think I did
        catch a moment but just brushed it off." Natalia said after some
        thinking "When was this?" Ryan asked "Last year, the case with the guy
        that was decapitated while racing, we had to search his car, and when I
        entered the lab I saw you were on the phone with big smiles. I just
        stood there watching you not wanting to disturb whatever bubble it was
        that you were in. But when you hung up, I asked if it was your
        girlfriend and you said no." Ryan's eyes lit up at recognition "I know
        the moment you're talking about, but I didn't lie though. Heather is my
        wife, not girlfriend." Ryan said with a pointed finger and that caused
        Natalia to smile at the fact he was right "Ah, you're right. I just
        asked the wrong question. Damn it." you guys laughed at that, you guys
        chatted some more before you all said your byes and parted ways.

        Coming in through the apartment door, both you and Ryan took off your
        shoes and rest down your bags "Home." you said stretching and Ryan took
        hold, hugging your stretched out form causing you to giggle. He was
        hugging you from behind, so you brought your hands down to take hold of
        his in front of you. You felt him move into your neck placing kisses "I
        missed my wife today." Ryan said softly but not stopping his assault
        "What are you talking about, you saw me today?" you said leaning your
        head to the side exposing your neck more to Ryan "Yeah, but only stolen
        glances, I didn't get to touch you or talk to you." you giggled at that
        and Ryan tightened his arms around you "But you get to have me in the
        morning before work and in the evening after work." you commented but
        Ryan just sighed "It's not enough." you chuckled turning in his arms to
        finally look up at him "Well, it has to suffice. You used to do it
        before." "I know, but spending months away from you, I want to make up
        for lost time." you raised a brow bringing your hands to clasp behind
        his neck "Now who is to blame for that." Ryan just sighed "Mine." you
        smiled and leaned up kissing his sulk away "We have the rest of our
        lives to make up for it." you said truthfully and that caused him to
        smile at you "Can we start now?" Ryan said with a smirk causing you to
        laugh "If you mean sex, I'm too tired, but if you mean sleep, I will
        gladly accept it." Ryan chuckled while tightening his grip on your hips
        "But you know I can always do all the work." you laughed exiting Ryan's
        hold walking away to the direction of the bedroom "Even if I fall asleep
        in the middle of it?" you asked as Ryan followed you "We both know that
        won't be happening." "Someone is very confident in themselves." you said
        with a raised brow entering the bedroom, beginning to shed your clothes
        "I'm just speaking from experience." you chuckled "Well, I am truly
        tired, but we can take a bath together." "No funny business?" Ryan asked
        as he started to take off his clothes as well and you shook your head
        "No funny business, but I will make it up to you." you said approaching
        him causing Ryan to smile "You know you don’t have to do that. I respect
        that you're tired. I'm fine with just holding you close in the bath." he
        smiled down at you before pecking your lips "Thank you." "May I?" Ryan
        gestured to lifting you up and you giggled "You may." with that he swept
        you off your feet causing you to giggle more before heading for the
        bathroom.
