            Your work day went by the same as usual, you worked at the lab today and helped out the CSIs on the main case, while working other smaller cases along the way and before you know it your shift was over. Today was an exciting day for you, well both you and Ryan because you were moving back home today and you did need a little help cause after receiving the promotion you've managed to collect a lot more stuff both personal and pertaining to work, so when you asked Ryan to give you a hand he was more than happy to help plus he was curious to know where you staying while away. You had to meet him at home first to pick him up because he was finishing work later than you. So arriving home and coming through the doors felt nice knowing that you're back home for good now and you really missed living with Ryan. So taking off your shoes and dropping your bag, you headed to the bedroom to remove your clothes and shower. Just wanting to get into the formality for your previous life. You and Ryan really had a deep conversation and he definitely knew how close he was to losing you and that was the worst feeling he ever experienced and promised to change cause when you weren't in his life because that was the worst and he realized he doesn't want a life without you, so he did everything in his power to get you back, and he's not going to stop till he is the best husband for you because that's what you deserve. Just as you were finishing up your shower that's when Ryan came home, so seeing your belongings by the door made him smile, because you were back and he just felt his heart swell with joy. Ryan made his way to the bedroom just as you were exiting the bathroom, tow1el wrapped around your body. "Hey, you're finally home. Thought you were going to be home later." you said as you saw him and headed to the dresser, you still had clothes at home cause it would have been too much to travel with. "I managed to finished earlier than needed." Ryan just stood there watching you not believing what he was seeing, you home, really home. "Something wrong?" you asked as you realized he was looking at you "No, everything is perfect. I'm going to go and shower, then we can go." you nodded "Okay babe." you offered a smile then turned back looking for clothes. The smile would not leave Ryan's face as he headed to the bathroom, he kept telling himself to remain calm, as to not freak you out. After you were dressed, you headed to the kitchen to see if Ryan kept it stocked with food or if he lived off of take out and upon inspection, it was the latter so while you guys were out, you need to take a trip to the supermarket. While making a list of things you needed Ryan entered the kitchen wearing jeans and a green t-shirt "What are you doing?" "Making a grocery list, because apparently we have nothing here to eat." Ryan smiled shyly at that while scratching the back of his neck "Yeah sorry about that, you know I can't cook." you chuckled "I know, it's okay. On the way back we can stop by the supermarket." Ryan nodded and watched as you made the list. When you were finished you looked towards him "Ready?" "Yes mam." he said barely containing his excitement "Easy there, it's going to be okay." you said making him grin "I know I know, but you're back, and I've been dreaming of this day since forever." you chuckled approaching him "Well you turned out to be an amazing husband in the end, just needed tweaking along the way." you tapped his cheek and walked away not waiting for his reply "I'm driving." you said grabbing your keys and you both were out the door.

            Arriving at where you were staying Ryan kept looking around, he knew exactly where you were but he can't let you know that because of the tracker in the necklace. He doesn’t know that you know, but you'll like to keep it that way for now. "Ready to see my living arrangements?" you asked getting out the car as Ryan followed "Yes mam." it wasn't long before you reached your apartment door, unlocking you entered and Ryan followed in immediately looking around. "Wow, you were actually living pretty good." you chuckled at that "You expected me to live badly?" you asked with a raised brow and Ryan shook his head "Not what I meant really, was just expecting something smaller." "Well I wanted to live comfortable while away from home cause I didn't know how long I would have been here for." Ryan felt guilty at those words, so he turned to you taking your hand in his "I'm sorry." so you dismissed him "No, it was my choice to move out. I couldn’t kick you out because that would have made things worse for you." Ryan was confused "What do you mean?" you explained and realization hit him, getting back on his feet would have definitely been a lot harder to achieve if he moved out. Then his heart filled with both love and guilt because after what he put you through, you were still thinking of him first and putting his wellbeing before yourself, by letting him stay there to make his life easier. After realizing that, Ryan immediately took you into his arms engulfing you in a hug. "What's this for?" you asked hugging him back "That although I was an awful husband to you and hurt you, you were still thinking and caring for me." he pulled away and held your face in his hands now "I really don't deserve you Heather." you could see the pain in his eyes "We're only human Ryan, and we make mistakes, but it's what we do with those mistakes that matters and you've learnt from yours." you told him truthfully, and the love that Ryan held for you at this moment just ten folded because in his hands he literally felt like he was holding his world, and he couldn't believe how close he came to losing you and how could he do what he did to you, the most precious being he's ever met "I'm so sorry." he apologized once again but this one felt heavy, so smiling up at him you removed his hands from your face and held "Stop beating yourself up babe, I've forgiven you and I'm here to help you. We're in this marriage together to the very end." he couldn't believe he was so lucky to have someone like you. Wasting no time Ryan connected his lips with yours and poured all his love and sorrows into the kiss letting you know how he felt.

            After that shared moment, you guys got to work in gathering your belongings. It only took an hour before everything was together and packed into your vehicle. So handing in your keys and signing final documents you were ready to leave that building hoping to never see it again. "Think fast." you said tossing the keys to Ryan "I'm driving?" you nodded "I'm tired and I love being the passenger princess." you said causing Ryan to chuckle so he kissed your temple "Okay baby." you guys got in and headed to the supermarket, buying groceries that are needed before going home.

        <p class="story">
            "Happy to be home." you said coming in through the door first with the final things in hand and Ryan followed behind you, holding items as well, you guys had to make two trips. "And I'm happy that you're home." Ryan said resting down his things and you did as well. Before you had opportunity to do anything else Ryan took you up in his arms lifting you up and doing a quick spin before settling you back down "Gosh have I missed you." he said capturing your lips with his causing you to smile "And I've missed you too." you replied after you guys pulled away "And I promise to never give you another reason for you to leave." he said smiling down at you "I'll hold you to that." you give him one more peck before getting to work with putting away the stuff. Ryan put away the groceries while you put away your belongings. When finished your body flopped unto the bed and allowed the tiredness to overtake you, so closing your eyes you relished in the feeling of being back to your old life and you were more than happy. When Ryan was finished in the kitchen he joined you in the bedroom "Tired?" he asked entering the bedroom seeing you laid across the bed "Exhausted." you replied back not bothering to open your eyes, and shortly after you felt Ryan lay next to you. "Hungry?" you heard Ryan asked and you nodded "Want me to cook my famous mac and cheese?" your eyes opened at that looking at him with a wide smile "Yes please." that made him chuckle, he moved forward and kissed your forehead before getting up "You got it." with that he disappeared once again to the kitchen.

            After dinner and getting ready for bed, you were in bed already, just watching tv while Ryan was in the bathroom brushing his teeth. "Have to go to the lab tomorrow?" Ryan asked coming into the bedroom "Yeah, but I'm supposed to have a meeting at 11 at the company." "Okay, so would you still be able to make lunch?" Ryan asked getting into bed beside you, you thought for a moment "Hopefully, the meeting shouldn't go pass an hour, but if it changes I will let you know." Ryan nodded and you both watched tv till sleepiness arrived. That night you both had the best sleep since you guys broke apart, Ryan held you that night like he didn't want to lose you and you gladly accepted it because you missed being in his arms.
