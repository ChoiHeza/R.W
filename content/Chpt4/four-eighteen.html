            You were currently taking a little break by stretching your legs with a walk around the lab, but while passing by the video lab you saw Ryan inside, so a smile appeared on your face before heading for the entrance. "Hello hello." you said with a knock as you entered "Hey there beautiful." Ryan said as he turned to look at you "What brings you by?" he asked so you made your way over to him "Was just taking a break and stretching my legs, but I saw this handsome guy from outside and decided to pop in." you said causing Ryan to chuckle as you sat next to him "Cute." after sending you a smile he turned back to the computer "So what are we watching?" you asked as Ryan got ready to pull up a video "A tape that was recovered from the vault." you nodded and he hit play. As you both watched your eyes widened "Is this what I think it is?" you rested your hand on Ryan's forearm giving it a squeeze "I sure hope not." the beginning of some suggestive things were taking place before your eyes "Is this okay to watch?" you asked looking at Ryan wanting to look away from the screen and saw that he was highly invested "Well, it's for the case, so.." you just shook your head staring at him, smile raising to your lips "Look at you." your statement made Ryan look away to meet your eyes "What?" he asked confused and you pointed to the screen "You're clearly enjoying that." you chuckled and Ryan was quick to protest "Not really, a thought was just going through my mind." you raised a brow with a questioned look "And what is the thought?" just as Ryan was about to reply Calleigh entered "Hey guys." so Ryan gave you a look that said we'll talk later before greeting Calleigh "I'll take my leave." you said squeezing Ryan's arm before getting up. You greeted Calleigh before leaving and heading back to your lab.

            Arriving home and taking off your shoes you remembered that you didn't get to hear Ryan's thoughts from earlier. "What was it that you were going to tell me?" you asked heading to the kitchen and Ryan followed behind "What do you mean?" Ryan asked removing his jacket "When we were in the video lab." you replied and a look of recognition appeared on Ryan's face, then it was followed by a smirk "I was just thinking about us." you retrieve a water bottle from the fridge before turning back to him resting his hands on the kitchen island "What about us exactly?" you asked before taking a sip of water "If I wasn't a cop, I probably would of made a sex tape with you." his response made you choke on your water, entering a coughing fit, Ryan was immediately by your side rubbing your back "Just breathe." Ryan instructed you, so after getting it under control you turned to Ryan "What!?" and Ryan chuckled with a shrug "You're actually serious?" you asked looking at him fully now "I don't know. The thought only crossed my mind today, and was curious as to why people do it. Then I was gonna suggest we do it but then figured it would be a bad idea cause I'm a cop and I don't want you get in trouble for something like that." Ryan went on explaining reasons why it would be a bad idea. But a thought crossed your mind, so setting down the bottle you turned back to Ryan halting his rambling "I mean, we could record the video, watch it, then delete it right away. Although if not careful, deleted things can be recovered." Ryan raised his hands "Wait a minute. Are you actually suggesting what I think you're suggesting?" there was a bit of hope in his voice but you just shrugged your shoulders "Oh baby, come on. Use your words please." Ryan said bringing his hands to your waist so sighing you replied "I was sort of suggesting it, cause a part of me is also curious as to why people do it." that made Ryan smile very widely "Oh be still my sweet beating heart." that made you giggle "It was just a suggestion Ryan, but a very dangerous one." you said stepping out his arms heading for the bedroom "Come on babe. Just don't say things like that, it makes me all excited." Ryan said following after you "But you're the one that brought it up." you stated "True, but I saw how it wouldn't be wise, but you found a loop hole. And plus you're an amazing tech person, I know you can delete the video without any traces of it left behind." you stopped as you entered the bedroom, and your mind went to thinking about what Ryan just said "I can see the gears in your head turning and I know you're thinking about it." Ryan said approaching you from behind, wrapping his arms around your waist pulling you against his body. "It is doable but I don't know, there's still that fear that it'll be discovered." you said speaking your thoughts "Well, we don't have to do it right this second, we have time to think about it. Plus you could always make sure that a video is definitely gone when deleted." Ryan said resting his chin on your shoulder and you nodded "You're right, I'll look into that." you brought your arms up to join his "Cause lowkey, making a sex video sounds kind of fun." you said smiling and that made Ryan turn you around in his hold to face him "Are you Heather? What have you done to my wife?" you chuckled smacking his chest "It's still me Ryan." he laughed "I know. It's just different hearing you say those words." "Is that a good different or a bad different?" you asked bringing your hands up to wrap around his neck "It is definitely a good different. I love it." Ryan said tightly gripping your waist bringing his face closer to yours "Imagine, if you really weren't a cop, how much of those tapes we could make." you said ghosting your lips over Ryan's "You will be the death of me." Ryan moaned before finally connecting your lips together in a very heated kiss.
