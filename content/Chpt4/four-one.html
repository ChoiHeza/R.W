            Since getting the job, you've had the seminar, introducing the new program and surface computer that's going to be used in the lab. You were so stoked that this was happening. It being your first day, working at the lab, you were excited and nervous, also a bit bummed because you and Ryan were looking forward to this moment because you guys would be working together but he had to go and do what he did, but you weren't going to let that hinder you. Horatio made sure that your transition was smooth and no hicks because of your married name and before you know it, you were in the lab waiting for the CSI team to come one by one for their personal training on the new device and program. Making sure everything was set up and in place, you heard a knock from the door entrance behind you, and you weren't surprise to see who your first student would be "If it isn't Eric Delko." you greeted with a wide smile, which he returned with a laugh "Hey Heather, you make me sound like I'm famous." you chuckled "I've been hearing some things, it's like you have a fan club." you whispered and he chuckled. When he fully came in you guys shared a hug. "How have you been?" you asked "I've been good and hanging in there, what about you?" you smiled and turned gesturing to the screens in front of you "Great, I'm doing my dream job." Eric was truly happy for you "I bet Wolfe was happy when you told him." you turned to Delko "Yeah, he was happy for me." "Why did you say that like it was a bad thing?" you and Delko have gotten close, and he confided in you a lot so you know you can trust him but you just haven't gotten a chance to meet since Ryan got fired "I left Ryan." Delko's eyes widen "Temporally." you added then explained what happened "Well I don't blame you, but you're his wife, and you were in the dark just as much as us." you nodded "That's the part that made me leave, just till he rights his wrongs." Delko completely understood and backed you on all your actions "So you haven't seen him since then?" you shyly smiled "When I got the good news we may have hooked up, but that's it. No contact." Delko laughed "Hooked up?" "Hey, don't judge me, at the end of the day we're still married." you said raising your hand to show the ring "I don’t see a ring, but what I do see is a tattoo." Delko said reaching for you hand, then you remembered you weren't wearing the ring, and it was on your necklace because the tattoo was still healing "Oh yeah." you chuckled "Does it say R.W.?" Delko asked upon inspection and you sighed before nodding "It was foolish, my friends and I went drinking a night, and got stupid drunk and starting daring each other to do things and I was dared to get a tattoo and apparently this is what I picked." you said taking the same hand to cover your face and Delko laughed "Looks like you're obsessed. I hope you don't regret it." you shook your head removing your hand "I don't, Ryan is still the love of my life, and he'll be back, he just needs time. But enough about me, what about you and you know who?" you said wiggling your eyebrows because you know that Eric has a thing for Calleigh and you have been begging him to let you put in a good word for him but he refused "Well, that shipped has sailed, she's with Jake now." you smacked his arm "I cannot believe you Eric, you could of let me do the talking." he shrugged "But I'm sorry though, I was really rooting for you guys." "I know, me too." there was quietness before Delko asked "You really don't know what Ryan is doing?" you shook you head, "We don't keep contact but just between us, Ryan doesn't know that I know that he tracks me." "What do you mean?" you lifted the pendent on the necklace you were wearing "This necklace that Ryan gifted me has a tracker in it. I figured it's just in case I'm ever in danger and he needs to find me, because of how dangerous his job was." "So then how did you find out?" "When I was building a tracking locator, I was using a tracker for testing but the program kept picking up two, and I thought the code was broken until I found out what the second tracker was, the necklace." you said playing with it "And I know it's not because he doesn't trust me, it's because he always said his top priority is keeping me safe." "I guess that's kind of sweet." you both chuckled "He has his moments. Now are you ready to learn this software." "Yes mam." and with that you guys got started on your one on one lesson.

            Ryan was at his current job, one he managed to get, it was a gun range, the pay wasn't bad but not enough. But right now it was better than nothing and he had to take what he could get. While checking the stock on the shelf behind him, his attention was alerted by a customer and turning around he saw it was Natalia. "Hey, Natalia!" it felt nice to see a familiar face, they greeted each other "What happened to all the paper work I helped you out with?" Ryan explained the situation to her and she expressed her sorrow. Then Ryan questioned why was she here and she told him, which he understood. So he signed her up before they got started. So watching Ryan, something caught her attention "You got married?" she asked pointing to the wedding band on his finger, so Ryan paused flexing his finger before looking up to her "Yeah, like three years ago." he chuckled then went back to signing the form "I'm confused, you've been married all this time?" he paused again to explain this time "Yeah, I just didn't wear the ring while I was an officer, the less the criminal knows about your life the better." Ryan said looking at her "I get that, but I had no idea." Ryan shrugged "Only very few knew, so don't worry about it." "So three years huh?" Ryan nodded smiling "Yeah, we've been together for five overall." "That's really sweet. When is the anniversary, I would love to get you guys something?" Ryan's smile dropped hearing the question "It's supposed to be tomorrow." Ryan said trying to hide his expressions but Natalia caught on "You don't sound too happy about that. But if you don’t mind me asking, what's wrong?" sighing Ryan replied "Me, I'm the wrong. I messed up. The gambling, she was in the dark just as much as you guys." Ryan said with a thin smile "So she left and I'm to get my act together and get things sorted before bringing her back into my life." Natalia wanted to say something but wasn't sure if it was her place but Ryan told her it's okay "Speak your mind." sighing she started "Well, in my opinion, I would of done the same thing. Us, I understand if you didn’t tell, but she's your wife Ryan, she's the one person you shouldn't have left in the dark on this. I bet that broke her trust." "I know, I messed up big time, and it's not going to be easy but I won't give up, hence the job." Ryan paused for a bit before continuing "Do you think she'll take me back, based on what I did?" Natalia thought for a moment "Well before she left, did she leave her ring behind?" Ryan shook his head "I'll take that as a sign, plus if she loves you, truly loves you, she just wants what's best for you and she'll wait, but she won't wait forever." Ryan listened, he just needed the reassurance because he really doesn't want to lose you "Thank you, I really needed to hear that." Ryan offered a smile "Of course, and when you guys get back together you have to introduce me." Ryan chuckled "I'm surprised you haven't met her as yet." "What do you mean?" "She's the new computer tech that joined the CSI team, her name is Heather." and Natalia's eyes widen "She's your wife, no way!" she was stunned and Ryan nodded "Damn Ryan, you really messed up. You really did that to someone that smart and that gorgeous." Ryan sighed but couldn't help but smile a little at the compliment you received "I know, she's perfect and I don’t deserve her, but I'm working on being a better person for her." "Please do, cause I was blown away by her at the seminar. I'm supposed to meet her one on one today." Ryan's ears perked at that "Really? Can you do me a favour, put in a good word for me, like let her know that I'm on the road to being better, be subtle about it, like it's not me telling you to tell her." Natalia chuckled nodding "I understand, don't worry. Anything else?" Ryan thought for a moment "Um, check to see if she's still wearing her wedding bands and tell her that I miss her." Ryan gave a sad smile "I will." she offered a smile of her own. Then they got to doing what Natalia came to do.

            You were currently in the lab awaiting your next student, while making sure everything was prepared and it wasn't long before a female voice sounded into the room "Hey." you turned and welcomed her in, you had your hand outstretched "Hey, I'm Heather." she took it and introduced herself "I'm Natalia Boa Vista." you chuckled "Boa like the snake." and she laughed at the comment because she remembered that Ryan told her the same exact thing "That’s funny because Ryan told me the exact same thing when we first met." you gave a puzzled look "Oh, um, sorry, I only recently found out that you're his wife." "No need to apologize, was just curious to how you knew." so after dropping hands you both walked to the interface and rested your hands on top, and Natalia decided to take a quick glance at your hand to see if you were wearing the ring, it wasn't present, but a tattoo did caught her eye, R.W. and she smiled because she could tell it was fresh, and based on what Ryan told her, it had to happen after you left him. So putting the clues together Natalia figured you weren't wearing the rings because the tattoo was still healing. At least she has some very good news to tell Ryan. "Because if someone knew, they didn't know what I looked like." you said continuing pulling Natalia from her train of thoughts "Well lucky for you I only just found out that Ryan was married because I had no idea." "Was it Eric?" you said smiling and Natalia shook her head "It was Ryan actually. I just saw him." your heart fluttered at that "Then I guess he explained it all to you." "Yeah, after I asked about his ring cause I never saw him wore it before." your heart swelled at that, he was wearing his ring freely now and not having to worry about ill intent individuals "He's working at a gun range, working pretty hard might I add. I actually did try to help him with getting reinstated quicker but this one guy that works over us, he sucks and makes everything so much harder, but Ryan is in development to be better." you chuckled at that "I know Ryan put you to this." you said giving her a knowing look and before she could protest she sighed "How did you know, I thought I was doing a good job." "You were, don't worry, it's just that I know Ryan, well, I would like to think that I do, he's my husband, we've been together for 5 years and I know he would of told you to put in a good word for him." "I hope you're not mad." you laughed and shook your head "I'm not, don’t worry. But I know that's he's doing his best to rectify things so I can come back." Natalia released a sigh "Then that's good, I don't want to make things worse for him. Also he wanted me to tell you something." you turned to show you were listening "He wants you to know that he misses you and it shows, that he's really missing you." you smiled at that "Thank you, I do miss him too." you guys talked a little before getting started "Just before you get started I really have to say, you're so gorgeous, I'm in awe." you chuckled "Thank you and I was just here thinking the same thing about you." you told her sincerely "Since guys aren't the best, want to get together after work and go for some drinks?" Natalia asked and you beamed "I love the sound of that, it's a date." you said playfully throwing a wink her way which made her laugh and then you guys got started on the task at hand.

            The last person remaining was Calleigh so when she entered, her smile was bright and greeted you with a hug "When I found out you were the new tech I was over joyed, welcome to the team Heather." "Why thank you Calleigh. All ready for your one on one?" "Not as yet, still working on the case but I do need your expertise to help find out something." you nodded "You got it." so you both turned to the screen and got started "Did you manage to find him?" a male voice asked as they entered the room "We're trying to round it down." she said turning to him "Jake, this is our new computer tech Heather Wolfe and Heather this is detective Jake Berkley." she introduced you two and you guys shook hands. 'So this is the Jake that Eric mentioned.' you thought to yourself while turning back to the screen. "Wolfe huh, any chance you're married to Ryan?" Jake asked and you nodded "Yeah, I am." before he could ask anything else, the software pinged letting you know you guys found what you were looking for "That's it, thank you so much Heather." Calleigh said cheerily starting to leave with Jake following "I'll be back after." "No problem.". She did return later as promised and had your last session for the day and before you know it, the working day was over. You and Natalia headed off together for some drinks, having a nice time and getting to know each other. You guys made sure this wasn't going to be the last time you guys hung out. She also encouraged you to at least meet up with Ryan tomorrow for your anniversary and surprise him, instead of the text message you said you would of sent. "Look at it like a cheat day, plus it's not every chance you get to enjoy your 3rd wedding anniversary, that only happens once." you thought for a moment and she was right "I know Ryan broke that trust but the day I was helping him with the paper work, he truly looked like he regretted it all, and he wouldn’t stop beating himself up over it." you smiled at that cause you know how Ryan can be "You think he really means it this time?" Natalia nodded "I do, the guy lost his job and wife the same day. If that doesn't make you want to change I don't know what will. And knowing Ryan, at the end of the day, he's a really good guy, just got carried away with a bad habit, but it still doesn’t justify what he did, and you were right for leaving." she raised her glass which you clinked to " But you're right. He is a good guy." you said after you both took your sip. You guys continued chatting and drinking getting closer and enjoying each other company. It was a great way to end the day.
