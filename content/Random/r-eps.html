            Entering through your front door as you just got home from work. The apartment would be empty because Ryan was working till tomorrow morning putting in overtime working on a difficult case. Coming in you took off your shoes and placed your bag and keys down. On evenings like this when you have the apartment to yourself, you do some selfcare, all the fancy stuff leaving out nothing, so you wasted no time in getting started. After hours of pamper, and eating dinner you went to bed placing Friends on the tv in your shared room to fall asleep to, after texting Ryan a goodnight and sending him some encouragement for his long work night ahead and that you'll see him in the morning. It didn't take long before you were out like a light.
        </p>
        <p class="story">
            Ryan was at work finishing up some files on the case when he got your message. Not bothering to reply back instead he was leaving work the moment he was finished with these files to come home and surprise you, cause you won't be expecting him until the morning. "I am finally finished." he said voicing his thoughts out loud, "Lucky you." replied Eric, it was just the two of them there "Heather waiting up for you?" he asked Ryan "Nah, she isn't expecting me till in the morning, so I'm going to surprise her." "Aren't you the sweet one." Eric remarked with a chuckle "Ha ha. Very funny." Ryan faked laugh gathering his things to make way to the locker room "Have a good night here man." he said giving Eric a guy hug which he returned "Same to you, tell Heather I said hi." "Will do". Ryan left the lab and made his way to the locker room gathering his belongings then leaving the building. He got in his car and started to make his way for home. On the way, up ahead he saw an injured person laying on the side of the road, so he pulled over to check it out "Hey, sir, are you okay?" he asked after he got out the car making his way towards the man "Not really, I could use some help." the stranger told Ryan, being oblivious to his surroundings, while approaching the stranger to help he didn’t notice someone sneaking up behind him. They took a swing at Ryan with a bat and knocked him out unconscious. They did quick work and placed him in their van kidnapping him.
        </p>
        <p class="story">
            Your 4 A.M. alarm went off waking you up. Getting up and stretching feeling totally refreshed you looked around for any signs to see if Ryan came home as yet and there was none. You got out of bed, and did your morning routine getting ready to go out on your early jog. After 30mins of getting ready which include being fully awake, and dressed in fit gear, you laced on your sneakers, ear buds in and left for your jog. You took your usual route, and it being a weekend the streets were still pretty empty, but there was another jogger approaching you coming from the opposite direction. As they got closer they did a wave which you returned, you stopped for a bit to catch your breath not noticing the person you just passed was coming back your direction. When you heard them it was too late, they had a cloth placed against your face and panic settling in caused you to inhale the contents in the cloth, making your body go limp in their arms and then unconsciousness. You weren't out for long before you woke up and found that you were tied to a chair, both hands and feet bound. Immediately you followed your instincts and screamed but was quickly silenced "Shhh honey, there is no one around to hear you scream." appeared a man from around the pillar in front of you "What do you want?" you asked him shooting daggers his direction and he just laughed "I want a lot of things." he got right in front of you and knelt down meeting you eye level. He reached out his hand towards your face stroking it and you turned your head away from the action "No no, don’t do that." he said bringing his hands back to your face making you look in his eyes "I didn't know CSI Wolfe's wife was this gorgeous. I can see why he kept you a secret and all to himself." that remark of his pissed you off so with his hand still touching your face you turned your head towards it and bit down hard on his hand managing to get the thumb and almost biting it off before he removed it quickly from your mouth with a curse of pain from him. That action earned you a hard slap across your face, and that really stung. Bile rising in your mouth along with the blood from his hand, when he placed his face in yours to warn you, you spat the contents in your mouth at him and then head butted him, knocking him to the ground. You guess your derby days came in handy "You really don't know how to behave, do you?" he said composing himself on the ground before getting back up "Why should I? I don’t believe in going down without a fight." you told him with determination in your eyes and that made him laugh "I really like you." he said before giving you a good punch in the stomach then face knocking you out.

        <p class="story">
            When Ryan came to it was hours later, and he was in the same situation as you, bounded to a chair by his hands and feet, but the guy with Ryan went harder on him and he received much blows due to not wanting to cooperate with them "Okay, I thought we could of done this the easy way Mr. Wolfe but you have left me no choice" the guy that was beating Ryan approached him with a tablet in hand and placed it in Ryan's lap for him to see, and what he saw made the blood drain from his face but he composed quickly and he got angry "What the hell have you done to my wife?!" Ryan shouted voice in rage, before him was a photo of you tied to the chair passed out with a bloody face "She was a fighter, I must tell you that. Bitch nearly bit off my guy's finger, but what happens to her next is up to you." that made Ryan look at the guy with a death stare "What are you talking about?" the guy laughed and smiled brightly, approaching Ryan again he swiped on the tablet still in Ryan's lap to play a video and it was of you still unconscious, being removed from the chair and placing you in a coffin like box and the guy quickly stopped the video taking the tablet from Ryan's view "What did you do?" he was seething with anger, and that video just made it worse "I see now that I have your attention. If you want your wife back alive and not in a body bag, you will do as I say." with your life on the line Ryan has no choice, and can't keep fighting them anymore "Okay, I'm listening." Ryan gave them his undivided attention. They wanted him to stop one of their guys from being arrested for murder, he had to do anything possible to stop it, whether it be tampering with evidence or interrogating him in a way that he isn't at fault. Ryan agreed to do whatever it was they wanted. "Don’t forget Ryan, the moment you mention this to someone else, one of your coworkers, consider your wife dead, got it?" "Got it" after that they placed a bag over his head and released him in a random location where they had taken his vehicle. Once he realized they were gone, he took the bag off his hand and searched his surroundings. Next to him was a paper bag which had his gun, badge, phone and a burner phone which they left for him to take orders from.

        <p class="story">
            Beaten and in pain, Ryan got in his car, and made his way home to clean up to go work, with him saving you as his main goal, he would do anything to keep you alive. Entering the apartment he was greeted with your scent that you left before going on your morning jog and that felt like a punch in the gut. How could he have allowed something like this to happen to you, that's why he kept you a secret. He continued beating himself up, taking blame knowing this is all his fault, but he is going to make it right, and get you back, no matter what. He cleaned up his bruises, showered and made himself look presentable for work because he can’t raise any suspicions. He arrived at work, did everything the same as usual and got in the hummer with his kit and drove to the crime scene assigned. Arriving he got out and greeted Eric "Hey man, sorry for being a bit late." he said which caused Eric to look his direction and react to his bruised face "No problem man, what happened to your face? Heather did that?" he asked with a light laugh and a little concern in his voice "You wish she did. Was just a little altercation on the way home, had to stop for something and just met a crazy guy, nothing serious." Eric bought the story but only after Ryan had to reassure him again that it wasn't serious "So explain what we're dealing with so far?" Ryan asked and Eric filled him in, but little did he know that Ryan already knew who killed the victim. To keep you alive he's got to make sure the guy isn’t caught.

        <p class="story">
            Ryan hated being the bad guy in this, he swiped some evidence, and when interrogating, he tried to twist Natalia's words to make the guy seem innocent and that really pissed her off "What the hell Ryan, what are you doing?" "I'm not so sure we have the right guy." that response earned a hard glare from her "The evidence points to him." and Ryan just shrugged making her even more angrier and stormed off before saying "Get your act together Ryan." he rubbed his face and just sighed, 'If only they knew' he thought to himself but little did he know that Horatio was keeping a very close eye on him knowing that something was off "Mr. Wolfe, meet me in the locker room in 5." H told him super discreetly to not draw attention in case there were watching eyes. When Ryan got to the locker room Horatio was already there sitting on one of the benches and Ryan joined him but facing the opposite direction "What's wrong Ryan?" H asked looking Ryan's direction and he contemplated if to speak up or keep quiet, cause if they find out you’re dead. Ryan sighed heavily while leaning forward elbows on knees putting his face in his palms, his mind running a mile a second. After a solid minute H spoke up "You can trust me, what is it?" Ryan sighed again and decided to follow his gut, removing his face from his palms he sat up and looked at H, colour all gone from Ryan's face "They have her H, the Russians have her." immediately Horatio understood everything that was happening, and why Ryan was doing what he did. "Do you know where they’re keeping her?" Ryan just shook his head no "But I can't raise any suspicion because the moment they know something is off, they'll kill her." Ryan was trying so hard to keep it together. H placed a hand on Ryan's shoulder for comfort. "Don’t worry, I won't let anything happen to Heather. Just leave the rest to me and trust me okay? Continue to work as normal." "Okay H." Horatio give Ryan's shoulder a reassuring squeeze before getting up and leaving the locker room. He made his way to the team and discreetly informed them of the situation, and told them to keep it quiet and do their job as normal, all the while trying to find where you are. Eric and Natalia felt bad for how they treated Ryan, and promised to do anything they could to save you.
        </p>
        <p class="story">
            Ryan continued to work like normal to throw any suspicious eyes off guard, he didn’t know that the team knew of the situation which was for the best. They ended up releasing the guy because of Ryan's doing and they pretended to be mad at him, but he doesn’t know that they're looking for you making sure you're safe before putting the guy behind bars. Ryan retreated to the locker room waiting for a call from the guy to say that you're released and safe, because he did what he was told but what he wasn't expecting was a call from Horatio "Mr. Wolfe, we found where she is, sending you the location." "I'm on my way." he hung up and looked at the location, leaving the building making his way to you, he just felt super relieved he could almost cry and he just might. Arriving at the sent location he saw that the police had the place surrounded and the bad guys arrested but refusing to give up where you were in the building. Getting out the vehicle and making his way towards the guy who he assumed had beat you "Where the hell is she?" Ryan yelled coming in hot and managed to land a punch on the guys jaw, but then being pulled away by Eric "He's not worth it Wolfe, let's not waste anymore more time and just go in to find her." listening to him, Ryan drew his gun and joined the others to search for you also being aware in case they are others still in the building. Everyone was shouting your name looking for you, they even brought in dogs, to catch your scent, Ryan was panicking and started to expect the worse when he heard Horatio shout for him "Wolfe, I think we've found her." Ryan wasted no time and got to where H was. The dog was sniffing the area and they realized it was a long hatch door, upon opening it Ryan recognized what was inside, it was the box they placed you in. He made quick work to get it opened, the sight inside the box made his heart drop, there you were, lifeless and beaten "Heather, please wake up." Ryan begged reaching for you taking you out the box "Someone get an ambulance here now!" Horatio shouted "Hey beautiful, please wake up." Ryan kept lightly tapping you, you had a weak pulse, still alive but being unresponsive was freaking him out. He held you in his arms and pulled you closer "Heather baby, please wake up. I need you to wake up." he kept saying over and over.
        </p>
        <p class="story">
            You felt Ryan holding you very close, a little too close "Too tight babe." you told him in a raspy voice, that made him released his hold on you to look at your face "Don't scare me like that." tears immediately sprang to his eyes, he thought he lost you "Are you okay?" he asked inspecting you and holding you more carefully in his arms "I'm doing just perfect." that made him chuckle and he carefully connected his lips with yours "I'm so sorry Heather." he said after breaking the kiss "Ryan, don’t start, I don’t have the energy to fight you on this, it's not your fault, do you hear me." Ryan just sighed but you knew he was still thinking it "Paramedics!" they rushed in and took a look at you taking you from Ryan and placing you on a stretcher. You quickly thanked H before the medics took you away to the ambulance and Ryan not once leaving your side.

        <p class="story">
            Laying in a hospital bed because you took some serious blows to the head and stomach, so the doctors wanted to keep you in for a little while just make sure it was nothing serious, and Ryan here at your side holding your hand not wanting to let it go "You know I can't run away right?" you told him jokingly and he just scoffed "Is it so wrong that I just want to hold my wife's hand?" and you shook your head no laughing at him, and seeing you laugh made Ryan smile and feel good inside, but in the back of his eyes you saw the way he looked at you, blaming himself for what happened "Ryan, please stop, it's not your fault, I am here, alive and with you." you reassured him bring your connecting hands to your lips to give his a kiss. "I know, but I can't stop thinking what if." he sighed and you gave him a stern look "If you don't stop, I will kick you out my room." he laughed lightly "Okay okay." "If it makes you feel any better I fought back, I nearly bit off his finger, spat at him and head butted him. I would like to say my derby days came through." you laughed and Ryan was impressed "It did cause me to get slapped and punch but that's beside the point, I've suffered worse." "You really are bad ass. Gosh I love you." that made Ryan's heart lighter knowing that you're okay "Didn't I tell you that I'm tougher than I look." you said flexing your arm causing him to laugh. He leaned forward and placed his lips on yours giving you the most tender and gentle kiss ever "I love you Heather." "And I love you Ryan." you said reconnecting your lips with his.
        </p>
        <p class="story">
            The sound of someone clearing their throat caused you to break apart "Of course it's you to ruin a moment." Ryan said looking towards the door seeing it was Eric there and that made him laugh "Can I come him?" he asked very politely "Come on in Eric." you told him very nicely and that caused Ryan to jokingly scoff "Just you?" Ryan asked "Nah, the others are coming, they wanted to stop at the gift shop." Eric chuckled then turned his direction towards you "How are you feeling?" he asked coming to stand next to Ryan "Pain free thanks to the drugs, my only problem is my hand being held captive by your coworker." that caused Eric to laugh "He is obsessed with you. Now that we know of your existence it's nonstop praise about you from him" you went an oh looking towards Ryan and he looked like a deer caught in headlights "I suddenly feel the need for coffee. I'll be right back." Ryan said releasing your hand, giving you a quick kiss on the forehead and high tailing out of the room making you and Delko laugh at him, Delko took the seat that Ryan was in and offered a hand to you which you took. Since meeting him you guys have hung out a lot, so you were pretty close "With Ryan gone, how do you really feel?" Delko asked you seriously giving your hand a squeeze "Honestly, I'm not doing bad, was I scared, a little bit, but I'm tough like that." causing Delko to chuckle "I heard about your Derby days, he was so excited to know about that part of you, I found him talking to Walter about it." and you just laughed, he really was obsessed with your derby days "I will show you guys the pictures later." "Ooooo, now I'm looking forward to that one." you both shared a laugh but you quiet down and got serious "Although I'm good and me telling Ryan I'm good, he still feels it's his fault, and no matter how much I tell him he's not to blame, deep down he'll ignore it all." you said with a sigh "I understand where you're coming from, also I understand where he's coming from, cause I have been in his position, when I lost my sister." you brought your other hand and comforted Delko offering him a soft smile which he returned "But give him time, because he's just thinking right now that he almost lost you." Delko was right, you could of died but you didn't.
        </p>
        <p class="story">
            After serious talking you and Delko were joking away when there came a knock at the door "Hello hello." it was Walters' voice "Hi teddy bear." you greeted him back which earned you a huge smile from him, cause he loved that nickname you gave him, he entered and following him were the others, Natalia, Calleigh and Horatio and they all greeted you, approaching your bed. Delko got up offering the seat to whoever wanted it and Walter took it cause he wanted his time with you too. You managed to get close with all of them, cause they were times after they finished worked a case they would invite you out with them, and they have adopted you to a part of their CSI family, and it just made your heart so warm. They all came bearing gifts, Walter brought you a teddy bear, or in his words, a mini him, Natalia brought you a basket of sweets, Calleigh brought another bear as well, and H brought you flowers. This was so sweet of all of them "So where is the lover boy?" Natalia asked "He left a while now, to get coffee." deep down you know he is somewhere spiraling, so you give Delko a look which he understood "I'm going to check on him." he left the room to look.
        </p>
        <p class="story">
            Ryan was standing there in front of the coffee machine just staring at it, his mind wasn't even near the coffee, his mind was on you, and what happened to you. That's how Delko found him, "Picking a flavour is always the hardest." he said approaching him breaking Ryan from his trance to look his direction "Yeah." was all he replied "Everything okay man?" the moment Delko asked that Ryan broke down and Delko immediately comforted him "Let's go for a walk okay." Ryan nodded following Delko outside and they took a seat in the bench area, Delko gave him some time to sober up and allowed him to be the first one to speak "Sorry about that." Ryan lightly chuckle "It's okay, I know exactly how you feel. If you need someone to talk to, I'm here for you." Delko offered a comforting smile and Ryan spoke "I just can’t get the image of Heather lying there in the box beaten and lifeless out of my mind."  Delko listened, Ryan spoke of how he was really feeling and how scared he was "I know, but always remember, she's alive and she's a fighter. She was a Bajan Tuff Gal." that response made Ryan laughed "I know you're right, she is still here." "If it makes you feel any better how about you asked her about enrolling in the defense classes that the station offers, I guess to put your heart at more ease." Ryan thought that was very good idea, he'll definitely run that by you "You ready to go back up, because before I left I'm pretty sure Walter was using his teddy bear charm on Heather." that caused them both to laugh so they got up and started to make their way back "Thanks man, for being here." Ryan told Delko sincerely "Always." they did a side hug.
        </p>
        <p class="story">
            Reaching back to your room, Ryan could hear the laughter coming from within, and his heart swelled knowing that you were definitely good and happy "You guys should really consider doing that." he heard Walters voice saying "You guys should consider doing what?" Ryan asked entering the room with Delko behind him "Creating a derby team." you said with a huge smile "Walter, she hasn't even left the hospital yet, and you're already trying to get her back in." everyone laughed at that. Ryan was better after his talk with Delko and seeing you made it better, so he promised himself to stop worrying and just focus on keeping you safe going forward, you were the love of his life and never wants to lose you.
