            You were in the kitchen drying the dishes and Ryan was in the laundry room taking out the load. He finished before you so he joined you in the kitchen to put away the dishes you just dried. There was a comfortable silence between you two but Ryan was the first to break it. "Can I ask you something?" he asked halting his actions and turned to you "Of course." "The packages that are delivered here, who are they delivered by?" he asked, and you took nothing by the question "Some man named Dustin." you said drying the last dish and turning to him "Is he good looking?" now this question caught your attention so you looked at him suspiciously, thinking about the guy before answering "He's a cute old man, he was probably good looking back in his day, why?" now it was your turn to ask the question cause Ryan was being weird "No reason." he try to shrug you off but you weren't buying it, you went and stood in front of him folding your arms "I don't buy it. What's the real reason?" he rubbed his face and sighed before answering "In the case today, one of the victims was a mailman and every apartment or house he delivered to, the wives or girlfriends would sleep with him, so I was just curious about our delivery person." he lowered his head a bit at what he said "Okay, but what does that have to do with our delivery guy?" you asked him super confused cause you weren't catching on. Ryan remained silent not meeting your eyes wondering why he was acting this way, then suddenly the light bulb in your head went off, oh no, you really couldn't believe he thought that, or the idea even crossed his mind "Ryan Wolfe, you can't be serious." you were a little annoyed "Did you really think, that I could be just like one of those wives?" you asked him with a stern look on your face and now he took a good look at you and saw he messed up "No. It's just -" he stopped short not knowing what to say "Just what Ryan? Tell me?" you were now furious "The thought just crossed my mind, that's all." he said with an apologetic face "It never should of. Ryan we've been together for eight years. Eight years!" upon hearing this, Ryan knew he made a huge mistake, bringing his hands together in a pleading clasp "Heather, beautiful, I'm sorry. I know you would never cheat on me, and you're right, the thought should have never crossed my mind. I trust you Heather, I do." you could hear the sorry in his voice, but you were at least still annoyed a bit, you just sighed, looked at him and walked away not wanting to say anything wrong "Hun, please, I'm sorry." Ryan said stalking after you as you made your way to the living room. You ignored him and sat down, he got down on the ground in front of you kneeling "Heather, I'm sorry. I was wrong for thinking that, very wrong. Please forgive me." he pleaded once a again and you sighed turning to him "Okay." you said folding your arms "Okay?" Ryan asked placing his hands on your thighs "Okay I forgive you." and that made Ryan smile, causing a small smile to appear on your lips "And you know, that I trust you right?" he said running his hands up and down your thighs "I know now." you replied rolling your eyes teasing him and Ryan sighed thinking he's still not in the clear but you corrected him right away "I'm kidding." you chuckled unfolding your hands to hold Ryan's. He released a huge sigh of relief "I know you didn't mean any harm by the question, but it was just the thought of it that hurt me to think you thought of me like that." you reassured him letting him know how you felt. "I understand, am I'm really sorry." he said giving your hands a squeeze which you return "I know, apology accepted." "So can I get a kiss to truly know that I'm forgiven?" he asked with the widest smile being all cute and of course you caved but you didnâ€™t let him know that "Let me think about it." you teased getting up with a chuckle making your way back to the kitchen to finish Ryan's chore of putting away the dishes. "Babe, you're killing me" he aspirated following you. He leaned against the counter watching you calling for you over and over with different pet names each time and you just kept laughing inside at his desperation. After you were finished putting away the last dish you figured you've tortured him enough "Still want the kiss?" you asked, shutting him up instantly "Yes mam." he said way too happily making his way to you lifting you up and planting a kiss on your lips causing you to giggle at the sudden action. You steadied yourself with hands on his shoulders as he spun you around. He stopped putting you down and capturing your face in his hands pulling you in again for another kiss making this one sweeter than the first "I love you so much Heather Wolfe, never forget that." he said looking deeply into your eyes meaning every word "And I love you Ryan Wolfe." you returned the genuinity which made him smile wide "Creep." you said slapping his chest leaving him "You really know how to hurt me." he faked gasp making you laugh.
