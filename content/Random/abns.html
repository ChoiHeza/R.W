            You've been in Miami for about a week now, a new job opportunity have been given to you that caused the sudden move from Barbados. You decided to take the opportunity because you haven't laid any roots in your home island as yet, no relationships, steady job or home. So you looked at this as a way to get a fresh start and lay some roots of your own, because after all it was a permanent job position.
        </p><br>
        <p class="story">
            You found a nice house to live in, but because you started work that same week you moved here, you haven't gotten a chance to unpack all your stuff, so they were boxes everywhere still full of your belongings. You decided to deal with the boxes on your off day, and that day would be today.
        </p><br>
        <p class="story">
            It was eight in the morning, music playing on the speakers as you went through your boxes and put away stuff in their respective places. Enjoying the music, dancing away, and fixing the stuff, you realized along the way that some of the light fixtures in the house were missing bulbs, so you made a mental note to do that next.
        </p><br>
        <p class="story">
            You decided to start with the living room bulb, getting the ladder and placing it under the light, you climbed up with the bulb in hand to put it in. After finished before coming down, you looked down and what you saw made you release a startled scream.
        </p><br>
        <p class="story">
            On the floor were two giant spiders, one behind you and the other to the left of you. To say that you were scared would be an understatement, you were terrified, you really really really don't like spiders. Panic started to settle in on what to do in this situation, for sure you weren't going to get down, and you knew no one as yet that you were close with so you did the next best thing, you decided to call 911. Yelling to your phone, you told it to call 911 while not taking your eyes off of the spiders.
        </p><br>
        <p class="story">
            "911, what is your emergency?" the female operator on your phone said "Um hi, my name is Heather, and I'm surrounded by giant spiders and I'm really scared and didn’t know who to call. I'm kind of new here in Miami." you told the operator, you heard her give a little chuckle before replying "Hi Heather, my name is Mayble, and it's totally fine that you called us, but there isn't much we can do but what I will do is send an officer to your house, to get you out of there and keep you company till pest control arrives because it will take a while before they can reach your destination. How does that sound Heather?" gosh she was so nice and helpful "That sounds perfect Mayble, thank you so much. How long will it take before an officer gets here?" you asked her cause you wish they were here yesterday "With our smart system, I've have already dispatched an officer that was near you and he should arrive there within the next 5 mins." "Oh my, you are amazing Mayble, thank you sooooo much." "You are very welcome Heather, and I wish you all the best." "I will try and the same to you, bye." "Bye bye", and she hung up, she was the sweetest and talking to her distracted you for a moment from the situation at hand.
        </p><br>
        <p class="story">
            Within the five minutes waiting till the officer arrived you not once took your eyes off of them. There was a knock at your door which then came a voice "Miami Dade! Mam are you there, this is Officer Wolfe?" a male voice came from the other side of the door, "Hi, I'm here, but I'm on the ladder and currently can't get to the door, but you can enter from the back, the door is open.", you told him. You always keep the front door closed but left the back open so air could pass through the house. "Got it." he replied as you heard him leave the front to come around the back. Your eyes remained on the spiders so you didn’t notice when he reached the back until you heard his voice. "Hey, I'm coming in." you looked up at him as he said that and made his way closer to you. "Can you help me please?" you told him "What is the problem?" he asked watching you closely, "They are spiders around me." you told him and as he got closer, you pointed them out to him, and he saw them which caused his eyes to widden "Whoa, those are some really big ones" he was amazed and a little terrified at the size of them. "Can't you do something, like shoot them?" you asked him and he looked at you in disbelief before replying "I can't shoot them but I will try to get you from up there and out of here so we can wait outside for pest control." he made his way around the living room avoiding the spiders and made it to an open space near to you on the ladder.

        <p class="story">
            "What now, because I am not stepping on to this floor. I feel the moment my feet touch the ground they are going to come after me?" you told him with a lot of fear in your voice and it was written all over your face. He looked at you thinking of an idea while looking back and forth at the spiders, then something flashed across his face, it was like a light bulb went off in his head "Okay, I'm going to need you to jump." and you looked at him confused "Jump where?" you asked "Jump to me, I will catch you." he told you holding out his hand in your direction. You got caught up in between minds because what if he drops you but you didn’t had long with your thoughts because the spider you had your eyes on started making his way towards you, so taking caution to the wind you screamed and jumped from the ladder towards his direction and he successfully caught you. With you in his arms, he made his way to the backdoor and got outside, and he closed the door to keep the spiders in.
        </p>br
        <p class="story">
            You were outside but didn't even notice it because the whole time you were wrapped tightly around Officer Wolfe, with your eyes closed tightly. It was only till you heard his voice that it broke you out of your state of fear. "Hey, we're outside, I've closed the door." so you loosened your arms from around his neck and looked at him and this was your first time getting a proper look at him and it was his as well. He was really cute and his eyes were a gorgeous light green colour, and the little smile he had on his lips was beautiful. You were analyzing his face but you didn't notice he was doing the same to you, looking at every little detail on your face and he thought to himself that this was the most beautiful woman he has ever seen. After checking him out, you realized that your body was still wrapped around him so you smiled and apologized and that broke him out of his gaze of checking you out as well "Sorry, I think we're safe now." you told him which caused him to chuckle and release his hold on you. You placed your feet on the ground and used his shoulders to steady yourself. You took your hands off of him and missed his touch already and he removed his as well and you put a little distance between you both. "Thank you so much. You have no idea how terrified I was." you told him with a smile which he returned widely, "Of course. Just doing my job, but I don’t blame you. Did you see the size of those spiders, those are the biggest ones I've ever seen." "You got to be kidding me, are you serious? I guess that saying 'You attract what you fear' must be true, cause in my years of life I've never seen any near close to that size." you told him truthfully, and he just laughed a little, being from Barbados, you have nothing near this size there.
        </p><br>
        <p class="story">
            "If you don't mind me asking I never caught your name." you chuckled "I'm sorry, my name is Heather,  I moved here from Barbados a week ago." you held out your hand to him which he took "Nice to meet you Heather, I'm Ryan, and welcome to Miami. How has your stay been so far, minus the giant spiders?" he smiled such a gorgeous smile "It's honestly been really nice, lifestyle and culture is different but nothing major. I really love it here." you replied with a pretty smile of your own which he decided to take a mental picture of. Your back was to the door, so you just heard a thump behind you not knowing what it was, so you turned around and saw one of the spiders had jumped against the glass door, you screamed and jumped right back into Ryan arms and that startled both of you causing Ryan to topple back and fall bringing you down with him. You both landed with an oof, and looked at each other and laughed. You stared at his feature once again since you were closer to his face and he did the same, but then came a voice that broke you both out of the moment. "Pest Control!" it was a male voice that shouted, you laughed, got up and offered your hand to help Ryan up which he took pulling himself up. "In the back!" you shouted back to the man, after a few seconds he came into view and you pointed to the door where the spider still was and he just whistled "Wow, I've never seen one this big in years, I don’t think this net alone is going to work. I'm gonna need the tranq gun.", he gave you a smile before turning to leave the yard, "They are two of them." you told him, "Gosh woman, you are just unlucky".
        </p><br>
        <p class="story">
            The man did his job and Officer Wolfe stayed throughout the whole process to make sure everything went smoothly, once completed, all that was left was some papers for you to sign so Ryan decided to take his leave, he didn't want to, because there was something about you that drew him to you but he chose to ignore it and be professional because he was still on the clock, so you both bid each other a farewell. A part of you wished he asked you for your number and Ryan kept thinking that he hopes he sees you again. After filling out the papers, the pest control guy told you that it would be best if you moved because they seemed to be an infestation problem, which was something you didn’t want to here. So that's what you did you moved to another house.
