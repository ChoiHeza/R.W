            "He saw the hat floating Heather, I kid you not." you were on the phone with Walter, he called to inform you of some important information "There was probably a vent nearby that caused the floating." you told him and that caused Walter to release a laugh catching you off guard "What?" you asked now intrigued "It's funny because that's your first thought, and you would think that would also be the first thought of a CSI." the moment Walter said that is registered in you what Ryan thought "Please don't tell me he thought it was a ghost?" that made Walter laughed even louder confirming your suspicions and you just shook your head laughing as well 'This man' you thought to yourself "This man works with science Heather, wow." you both just continued your laughing and that's when you heard the front door opened "Walter he's here. We'll talk later." "You got it, give him hell." "You don't even have to tell me. Later." you hung up and placed down your phone going to meet Ryan "I'm home hun." you rounded the corner approaching him "Hey babe." when you got in front him you quickly pulled him in attaching your lips together causing him to hum into your mouth "What was that for?" he asked after you guys pulled apart "Just really missed you today, plus you're wearing my favourite colour, and you know what that does to me" you said rubbing your hands along his shoulders, then took his bag off his shoulder to rest it down "What are you doing?" he asked raising a brow curious to your actions "Catch me." before he had time to register, you jumped up wrapping your legs around his waist and he caught you making you release a giggle. Before he had time to speak you planted your lips back on his which he gladly complied to. You felt him start to move towards the living room not breaking the kiss. He gently placed you down on the sofa following tracing kisses down to your neck. "So how was work today?" you asked him rubbing your hands through his hair "Was okay." he quickly replied against your skin, so you hummed a response and decided to tease him after what it he was planning on doing to you.

            You were currently in front the mirror pretending to try out hats that you owned, when Ryan emerged from the bathroom now finish showered "What are you doing?" he asked taking a quick glance at you before going over to the closet "I just saw this hat, and was trying to remember the last time I wore it and why I don’t wear it anymore." you told him nonchalantly "It does look nice." he said pulling on a shirt before sitting on the bed watching you "Maybe I should start back wearing it, after all it isn’t going to wear itself. Imagine ghost wearing hats." you said your best to not break character and laugh so Ryan wouldn't catch on, you heard him cleared his throat before replying "That would be a funny sight to see." he said clearly hiding something, so you thought this was going to be fun "So, anything interesting happened today at work?" you asked turning to face him taking off the hat "Just the usual." he said with a shrug so you decided when you were putting back the hat you'll drop it. Ryan was carefully watching the hat and you but little did he know that you had connected a string to the hat and your hand. With Ryan's eyes carefully trained on the hat you started to lift it with your hand and that caused Ryan to jumped a little and you broke out in laughter causing him to look at you and it all clicked in his head "Who told you?" he got up quickly pointing a finger towards you coming your direction and you raised your hands in surrender releasing the string "I'm not snitching." you said biting your lip trying hard to hide the laughter wanting to escape from you "Heather Amanda Wolfe, last chance, who was it?" he said trying to stop his smile from forming on his face and you shook your head, laughter slowing escaping "Fine, I have my ways of finding out the truth." he said and caught you off guard by lifting you up and tossing you on the bed then placing himself on top capturing you "You know what's coming." he warned you and before you had time to protest, the tickling began making your weak and erupt in laughter instantaneously. You didn’t last long before you were blurting out his name "Walter! It was Walter!" Ryan stopped after getting his answer "I knew it!" you said chuckling. Below him you were a crying mess from laughing so much so Ryan leaned down and planted a kiss on your forehead "You poor thing." then he got up leaving you to catch your breath. After you were good you turned to him and asked "But seriously Ryan, ghosts?" and he turned and give you a look "You weren't there and if you were you would of said the same thing." he said trying to defend himself "When Walter told me about it, my first guess was a vent, some flow of air." you got up and sat behind him, he was sitting at the edge of the bed. He sighed before saying "That's actually a pretty good reason." you hugged him from behind comforting him "It's okay hun, could have happened to anyone. I heard the guys had a field day with you at work." you said trying not to laugh "Not you too." Ryan caved and released a chuckle "It is funny." you circled around him and settled in his lap "My CSI husband believes in ghost." you couldn’t hold in the laughter anymore and Ryan was about to protest but you beat him to it "I find it cute." you reassured him placing a tender kiss on his lips. He sighed and looked into your eyes "Promise you won’t make fun of the situation anymore?" he asked you hopeful "Hmmm. I'll have to think about it." you said in a pondering voice and Ryan chuckled "Come on, I don’t need my wife making fun of me too." smiling you placed another kissed against his lips "Okay, I won't tease you but, I would like permission to mention it in the future." Ryan shook his head with a chuckle "Fine, I'll give you permission if you promise to help me get back at Walter." "For what, for telling me?" he shook his head "No, for pranking me this afternoon." now you were intrigued "What did he do?" you asked with a light in your eyes and Ryan didn't like the way they sparkled "I don't like this mischievous look in your eyes." he said giving you squinted eyes "Fine, don't tell, could always ask Walter." you said starting to raise from his lap but he captured your hips keeping you in place, he sighed then said "I was passing by the lab and saw the hat on the table so I went in to take a look at it and when I was reaching for it, a test tube nearby started to float surprising me." before Ryan could finished you started to laugh but he continued "and when I looked it was Walter upstairs pulling a string connected to it." now you were full on laughing hands covering your mouth and Ryan joined "That was a good one, classic Walter." and Ryan rolled his eye "Yeah yeah." "Okay, I promise I will help you get back at Walter." when you said that Ryan's eyes lit up "Really?!" and you nodded "Yes babe. No one messes with my baby, and gets away with it, even if it was a pretty good prank." Ryan got up and just gently tossed you off him to the bed causing you to erupt in laughter "You're so mean." he said standing next to the bed looking down at you with a his arms folded trying not to smile "I'm sorry. Forgive me?" you said sitting up facing him pouting and giving him puppy eyes so Ryan decided to play along "No babe, not the eyes." he said turning away from you to walk away so you quickly got up and jumped on his back "You're not getting away from me." you latched on yourself tight around him "Unhand me." Ryan exasperated "Never!" you released an evil laugh "Fine you win." he said standing still, raising his hand in the air in surrender, so you got off his back and walked to the front of him "So am I forgiven?" you asked and he lowered his hands capturing your hips "Always." he looked into your eyes and nodded his head in an up position signaling for you to jump and you did wrapping your legs around his waist. He placed a pecked on your lips before saying "Ready to plan Walter's demise?" and you slapped his chest "Ryan! We're not killing him!" and he chuckled at you "I know, but you know what I mean." "Yeah yeah." you said wrapping your arms around his neck "But before we do that there's something that I'll like to do again." with that Ryan brought you back to the bed tossing you once again hovering over you "I won't say no to that." and he from there he connected his lips with yours in a very heated kiss.
