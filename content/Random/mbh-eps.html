            "Hun, I'm home." Ryan said coming in through the front door but you didn’t hear him because you were in the bathroom taking a bath. After having a long day you needed to soak away your troubles, music was playing on the speakers surrounding the bathroom with sound. Ryan realized you didn’t hear him so he called again "Heather?" still nothing, after taking off his shoes at the door, he walked to the bedroom and heard music coming from the ensuite bathroom, so that's where he assumed you were. Resting his bag down and taking off his gun and badge placing them on the table, he made way to the bathroom door and knocked before opening seeing you laying in the bathtub relaxing with your eyes closed so you didn’t see him when he entered. You heard the music turned off causing you to open your eyes and look towards the source and that's when you saw your husband, a wide grin making its way to your face. "Hi, I'm sorry I didn’t hear you come in." you said sitting up to turn your body slightly towards his direction. "I've realized." he chuckled making his way toward you, leaning over to place a kiss on your lips with a "Hey beautiful." and you smiled into the kiss "You finished a bit earlier than usual, I assumed the case went well." you said leaning back watching Ryan "Yes mam, this kind of case was a first for me. Miami is crazy." he said shedding his cream jacket revealing his green t-shirt underneath, you love to see him in green and you told him that, so from since then he wears green majority of the time. "Now my interest is peaked." you gave him your undivided attention "You know that local hunting show I love to watch on tv?" he asked and you nodded "What if I said, here in Miami, in real life, there is a human version of it?" he was leaning against the bathroom doorframe now looking at you. You gave him a very puzzled look, just to think of what he could mean, well you had an idea what he meant, but no, that can't be right but you took a shot "Please tell me that they are humans not being hunted." you gave him a pleaded look and he nodded his head and a gasp left your mouth "What?! Here in Miami? They are people hunting people?" you asked in total disbelief "I wish I could say no, but that was the case today. There was this group that pay a good sum of money to hunt people" his arms folded now "And how do they get these people?" you asked still not believing what you were hearing "When immigrants are brought in, they sell them off.", you just shook your head at what you were hearing, "There are some people that are just super evil. Where do they do it?" "In the everglades." hearing Ryan say that made you look his way with a smile "So wait, that means, my husband, Ryan Wolf was in the wildlife." you just laughed and he chuckled "And you wouldn't believe what happened." he said bending over to pull up his pants leg showing off a new bruise he was sporting "What got you?" "A leech" and you laughed "You poor thing, the wildlife just hates you doesn’t it." you said gesturing towards the towel for Ryan to pass you "I told Natalia the exact same thing. Remember my other encounters with animals?" you stood up and took the towel from his hand wrapping it around your body "How could I forget, you were scared to go hiking for a while." you chuckled at the memory stepping out the tub. Ryan just rolled his eyes leaving the bathroom and you followed him into the bedroom coming up behind him and wrapping your arms around his waist leaning your head against his back "Why must my wife treat me this way." Ryan said speaking to himself pretending you weren't there "Because I love you lots." you said hugging him tighter and he turned in your arms looking down at you smiling wrapping his arms around your waist pulling you closer to him "I know you do Mrs. Wolfe." he held so much love in his eyes looking at you, "How did I get so lucky?" leaning down placing a very tender kiss on your lips "God just loves you." you told him admiring his features raising your hands to caress his cheeks, then pulled him in for another kiss making it a lingering one this time, pulling away you left Ryan wanting more "Now go shower, we have a dinner to get to." you said releasing him and pushing him towards the direction of the bathroom "Okay okay." he said reluctantly entering before turning around quick to ask you "Want to join me?" with a smirk on his lips "Nice one, but I'm already clean." you stook out your tongue at him and shooed him away, and he chuckled closing the bathroom door in defeat.
