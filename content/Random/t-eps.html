            "So, no work today babe?" Ryan asked as you got off the phone with your supervisor. You were both currently still in bed, only having woken up fifteen minutes ago. "No please, due to the tornado warning, we're recommended to stay home." you said cuddling back into Ryan arms. "I like how that sounds." Ryan started to lean in but then his phone went off and you both released a sigh "We both know what's about to happen." you said sarcastically getting out of Ryan's hold and turning your back to him laying back down "CSI Wolfe." you heard him say into the phone. Silence before he spoke again "I'll be there." he hung up and sighed "Beautiful." he said slowly coming your side leaving kisses along your shoulders, so you turned onto your back to look at Ryan "Go, it's okay." you gave him a reassuring smile "I'm sorry." he leaned in giving you a sweet kiss and you giggled "Ryan it's okay. Really, it is." you brought your hand up to caress his cheek offering a smile which he returned "Okay babe." he gave you a quick peck before getting up heading off to the bathroom. You watched Ryan walk off as you lay back in bed. Ten minutes later Ryan emerged with a towel around his waist, heading to the closet, figuring you went back to sleep but you weren't and watching his every move. "Wear the white henley." you said catching him off guard "I thought you were asleep." he said with a chuckle "Nope, I'm wide awake." Ryan started getting dressed, then he got to his shirt and put on the white henley as requested and you whistled "Looking sexy Wolfe." he laughed at you "Thank you, and I must say you're looking pretty sexy yourself." "But I'm not wearing anything?" "Exactly my point." he winked at you "And as much as I would love to stay with you and this gorgeous body of yours, I have to go." you sat up to meet him as he leaned down to leave an amazing kiss on your lips. He started to pull you in but you had to push him away "Ryan, you have to go or you'll be late." he sighed "You're right." he left a peck before starting to leave "Be careful today okay babe." "Always." and he was gone.

            You were currently in the living area watching tv when the breaking news came on, speaking on the tornado, and the thought of Ryan just suddenly entered your mind, hoping that he's okay and didn't get caught up in the tornado, cause you didn't know where he had to go. You would of called but you hate calling when he's on a case, and decided if anything happened you would of heard from him. You spent the rest of the day just lazing around, cause the apartment was clean and you had leftovers from yesterday.

            It was evening time when you got a call from Ryan "Hello baby. Everything okay?" you answered into the phone "Hey you, Walter and I were just finished with the case and were going out for drinks and wanted to know if you would like to join us." "Ooo, yes please, I would love to." you heard him chuckle "We'll be at the usual spot, need me to pick you up?" "No need, I'll take a cab." "Okay babe, be careful, see you soon." "Will do." you hung up and made way to the bedroom to get ready. After dressed you checked the full length mirror to do a once over on your outfit, white sundress, and a pair of sandals, with your twists down, to blow freely in the wind. After you realized everything was perfect, you grabbed your purse and was out the door.

            Arriving at the spot, you entered and looked around hoping to see Ryan at their usual seat but different people were there so you were about to reach for your phone to give him a call when you heard a shout of your name "Heather!" turning around, and finding the source, you saw it was Walter, you smiled and made your way over to them. "Hey beautiful." Ryan greeted when you approached them "Mrs. Wolfe, I'm glad you could of join us." Walter gave you his greeting, you greeted Walter first with a hug "Hey teddy bear." then turned to Ryan and the moment you saw his face, worry overcame you "What the heck happened?" you asked taking his face between your hands. Before Ryan replied you heard Walter cleared his throat avoiding your eyes taking a sip from his drink "Are you thirsty, what would you like, your favourite, let me get it for you." before you had time to register what was happening Ryan left from in front of you and was making his way to the bar. So you turned to Walter "Walter, what the heck happened?" he gave you a shy smile before saying "We may or may not have gotten caught up in the tornado." the last part came out softer that you barely heard "I didn't get the last part." before Walter could speak up Ryan returned back with your drink in his hand "One fancy fruit punch for my gorgeous wife." he placed it down in front of you "Thank you, but I would really like to know what happened." Ryan released a huge sigh then replied "The crime scene we had to go to this morning was in the path of the tornado, and Walter and I wanting to do our jobs efficiently, we were trying our best to reserve the body before the tornado hit, but we weren't fast enough and got caught up in it." you looked at the both of them appalled "When you say caught up in it, do you mean like trapped in the house when it passed over?" you raised a brow "More like, literally. It passing and sucking me away." Ryan said the hesitantly at the end "What?! You got sucked up by the tornado? How are you here standing?" you were so amazed now "That's all thanks to Walter, he saved my life." your eyes lit up and you jumped up from your seat enveloping Walter in a big hug, even giving him a kiss on the cheek thanking him and he chuckled before replying "No, if I held on, Ryan wouldn't have gotten sucked up." there was sorrow in his voice "Walter, shush, if my husband said you saved him, then you saved him. And he's here alive before us and not in a hospital or a morgue somewhere." you rubbed his back reassuring him "But-" "No buts Walters, you saved his life, I owe you one." and he chuckled accepting your gratitude and Ryan released a proud smile "And you Mr. Wolfe, survived a tornado, that's pretty awesome." you said leaving Walter's side going over to Ryan "I'm just built that way" he said smugly, taking you in his arms giving you a tight hug which you returned and placed a quick kiss on his lips. "I'm very happy your still alive, we both are." you sat back down finally getting a chance to attend to your drink "So I guess this is what the drinking is for, we're celebrating?" you asked and they both nodded "Guess I'm paying then." you said taking a sip "No no, my threat, cause I feel guilty." both Ryan and you gave Walter a stare "If anyone should be paying it should be me." Ryan said matter of factly, now it was your turn to look at him "Ryan, no, if anything, it should be me that's paying cause you both clearly had a crazy day, no arguments." you said with stern in your voice and fingers pointed to each of them, and they nodded in agreement "Good." you said with a triumphant smile.

            You guys were there for a full hour and half just joking away and laughing, while drinking from time to time but not to the point that you're drunk.  You were all now leaving the building, Ryan with his arm over shoulder keeping you into his side as you both walked and Walter to your other side "Thank you very much Heather, for paying." Walter thanked you but you waved him off "No need, it should be me thanking you, for saving the love of my life, plus I still owe you." You told him truthfully "The drinks weren't it?" you shook your head no and he laughed "Alright Mrs. Wolfe, I'll let you know." you nodded, and you both reached Walter's car first "Travel safe hun." you told him "Yeah, see you tomorrow." Ryan said to him "Same to you guys, tomorrow." he said back at you both before getting in, you both waved then made way to your ride, still stuck to Ryan's side, it was a quiet walk to the car. Reaching it Ryan unlocked but you paused standing in front him looking up to him "You sure you're okay?" you asked seriously "I'm sure, and if I wasn't, I wouldnâ€™t be standing here." he told you truthfully gazing down at you clasping his hands together behind your back "I still can't believe you were in that tornado, and now standing here in front of me" you took hold of his biceps and he smiled at you "Have to thank God for that, plus, we've promised to grow old together." you laughed "You're right." you got on your toes and planted a kiss on his lips "Let's get home." "Yes sir." breaking apart Ryan opened your door for you, then he got in himself and you both drove off making your way home.

            "Wait, I've just realized, you're not wearing what you left in this morning, most importantly, the henley." you were both home now, and in the bedroom removing your clothes "Yeah about that, the tornado destroyed most of the shirt, so that's in a trash bin at the hospital." your heart sunk "But you looked so gorgeous in that shirt." you sighed "Babe, it was me or the shirt." and he laughed "I know." you joined "Don't worry, I'll buy a new one." he told you "No no, let me, plus there are other clothes I've had my eye on that I wanted to buy for you." and Ryan rolled his eyes "You love dressing me up." you shushed him "You love it." you were both in your sleep wear now "That I do, because one, you make me look awesome and quit handsome and two, you pick out clothes that whenever I wear them they turn you on, so honestly I find that a win win situation." he said grabbing you at the waist "Guilty." you said raising your hands in surrender and Ryan laughed pulling you down into bed with him "Aren't you going to shower?" you asked him "Nah, I decided to shower at the station, before leaving, wanted to get tornado off of me." and you chuckled at his reply "So you're telling me that I missed a wet Ryan fresh out the shower with a towel wrapped lowly around his hips?" you said straddling his lap as he was leaning against the bed head "I'm sorry baby. I know you love when I come out the shower, but I just felt icky." you released a dramatic sigh "It's okay guess or whatever." he laughed at your actions "Let me make it up to you." you raised your brow at that "I'm listening." "I was given a second chance at life, so that means that I'm feeling pretty alive and full of energy." you were about to question him but that's when you felt it and you gave him a smirk "You sure you can do stuff. You weren't given any limitations right to what you can and can't do?" he shook his head raising his hands to rest on your bum "No mam." "I love the sound of that." "I know you would." he said and caught you off guard by flipping you both over, with him above you "Well Mr. Wolfe, what are you waiting for, make it up to me." "You got it Mrs. Wolfe." he said before crashing his lips against yours.
