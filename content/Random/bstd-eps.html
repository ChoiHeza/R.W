            You were sitting in the dining room, laptop on the table in front of you working, you got an email from your supervisor sending you a code snippet he did that he wanted you to check over for him. So that's what you were doing when you heard the front door open, "Honey, I'm home!" came the voice of your husband, wanting to take a break from your work, you got up to meet Ryan at the front door "Hey babe." you said turning the corner seeing him taking off his shoes but he seemed to be having a bit of trouble cause he had something extra in his hand "Mind helping me out?" he asked with a chuckle so you approached him and took the largest bag from him. It looked very foreign to you "What is it?" you asked him gesturing to the bag in your hands "That's a surprise." he said with the biggest smile ever plastered on his face. After he took of his shoes you both went to the dining room and he rest down his bag on the table. "When I got to my locker after work I saw that there." he said taking off his jacket placing it over the back of one of the dining chairs. He took the bag from you placing it on the table opening it up and inside was a telescope and you gasp "No way! The team got you that?" you said inspecting it with a wide grin on your face that matches Ryan "Yeah!" he replied but then your brain started turning "Wait, so how did they know about an old passion of yours? Don't tell me you told them the story of your bully." you said looking towards him and he sighed "I told Delko, and he told the others." you just laughed at it "I bet they found it funny as well?" you asked and Ryan just nodded his head smiling the whole time but you couldn’t contain your laughter "Babe I'm so sorry but that story was just the cutest." you told him bringing your hands to clasp his face "It's okay, looking back it is funny." he said while bringing his hands to wrap around your waist pulling you close towards him "Because my future turned out to be pretty amazing." he said leaning in to give you a kiss on your lips which you returned, and you guys just shared that moment for a bit, enjoying the presence of each other. You both broke apart and you went back to looking at the telescope "So where are you thinking of putting it?" you asked him running your hands along the design "Maybe by the window in the bedroom." and you agreed that was the perfect place for it "So what made you bring up your old bully?" you asked following him through the apartment as he took the telescope to the bedroom "It was the case we were working on, the victim was a bully to her classmates. She was a really mean one." he told you setting up the telescope in front the window pointing it up to the sky "So let me guess, one of the classmates killed her?" you questioned, sitting on the bed watching him "That's what we thought at first, but in the end it was the parents of two of the children that were bullied.", "That would have been my next guess, as they say parents would do anything for their children, so how did she die?" Ryan don’t mind you asking these questions cause he knows in your past that you once wanted to be a forensic scientist "She was stoned to death." he said adjusting the telescope "Damn, he without sin, let them cast the first stone." that's an awful way to go "It's funny you said that because Tom said the exact same thing." Ryan said with a chuckle making his way towards you, after he was finished setting up the telescope and he joined you on the bed sitting next to you after taking off his gun and badge and placing them on the dresser "Great minds think alike. A part of me thinks she deserved it but death was too much of an easy way out for her, she deserved to be still alive to suffer for her wrong doings." you said with a shrug and Ryan gave you a look "What?" you asked him and he just smiled shaking his head "It just makes me think that you would do something like that for our children if we had any." he said with a shrug and now it was your turn to give him a look "What?" he asked and you smiled "You think I would kill someone for our children?" he replied with a nod "Well you're not wrong." you told him and a shocked expression just took over his face "Who did I marry?" he asked placing a hand on his chest being dramatic "I'm leaving." you told him getting up to leave the bedroom but he caught hold of your wrist pulling you back towards him to straddle his lap, you placed your arms around his neck while he held you at your hips "I'm kidding." he said laughing and you just rolled your eyes "You know I love you right?" Ryan told you sincerely but you wanted to have some fun with him for teasing you "And I love you Wolfie." you told him biting your lip holding back a laugh "Oh no you didn't." he said falling back onto the bed and flipping you both so that he was now above you and that made you release a scream and he started tackling you with kisses in your neck tickling you "Ryan, I'm sorry!" you told him in between laughs "What's my real name?" he asked you stopping looking down at you trying to catch his breath and so were you "Your name is Ryan Wolfe." you said with a glint in your eyes tempting to say Wolfie again and he realized you wanted to as well, so before you could, he replied "Good girl." and then crashed his lip on yours making you forget whatever thoughts you were having.
