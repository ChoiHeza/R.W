            You had just been discharged from the hospital and you were both on your way home. Sitting in the driver's seat was Ryan and he looked towards you "Need me to stop anywhere to get you anything?" he asked, his right hand was clasped in yours on your lap while his left was on the steering wheel "I could actually use a milkshake." you said with a raised brow turning towards his direction. "Milkshake it is." he said with a chuckle. When the doctors knew that you were in no critical condition you were free to go, just bandages here and there and you felt some pain once in while from both your head and stomach.

        <p class="story">
            After stopping for the milkshake you guys arrived at the apartment complex. Before you could get out, Ryan was already out his seat and over to your side opening the door for you offering his hand, you giggled and took it "Why thank you sir." you got out and Ryan got your bags from the back. With bags in one hand and your hand in the other you both went up to your shared apartment after locking the vehicle. Ryan unlocked the door and you both entered "Happy to be home." you said entering and releasing a big stretch "Couldn’t be happier." Ryan said coming up to you and carefully wrapping his arms around your stretched form, causing you to laugh. You brought down your hands and wrapped them around him. It felt so nice to be back in his arms and holding him while in your home. You released a contented sigh and Ryan realized "Feels good doesn't it?" he asked and you simply nodded. After a while you guys broke apart and you looked around the apartment finding it in perfect condition "Thank God for having a husband with OCD." and Ryan just laughed "I'm serious. I never have to worry about coming home and finding the house in a mess." "You are welcome." Ryan said leaning down placing a kiss on your lips which you gladly returned.

            "I need to take a shower and then sleep." you told Ryan starting to head towards the bedroom "Go, I'll deal with your bags." "Thanks hun." you turned and left him heading off. Reaching the bathroom you shredded your clothes and hopped in the shower. Welcoming the warm water that flows down your body. After showering you got out and wrapped a towel around yourself going back into the bedroom. Ryan was currently changing out of his clothes, from a red t-shirt and jeans to white t-shirt and a pair of sweats. "Hungry?" he asked you while pulling on his shirt "No please, the milkshake was enough. Just feeling the need to sleep." you told him walking over to the closet "Okay. I'll put the clothes in the washroom." he said entering the bathroom you assume to retrieve the clothes that you wore. Shuffling through the closet you settled on one of Ryan t-shirts and a pair of shorts. After dressing you carefully plopped yourself onto the bed missing it softness. You were currently face down into the sheets just enjoying the comfort it offers cause the hospital beds were nowhere close to this, plus the sheets held Ryan's scent which you truly missed. "Can you even breathe?" Ryan asked coming back into the bedroom and you felt him plop down next to you shaking the bed a bit, so you turned your head to his direction "Just trying to savor the softness of this bed." Ryan chuckled at your behaviour "Leave me alone, let me enjoy this." he raised his hands in defense and got up. "Yes mam." you got up as well and laid back in the bed properly this time going to your side, bringing the blanket over you "Lord of the Rings?" Ryan asked getting the remote before coming back to bed "That sounds perfect." you said with a wide smile making its way to your face and Ryan chuckled getting into bed joining you under the covers. After selecting the movie Ryan laid back and you brought yourself to snuggle into his side as he brought his arm to wrap around your waist. It felt so nice to be back in Ryan's arms, and you know without a doubt that tonight is going to be the first in a while that you have gotten a decent sleep.

            Ryan was currently stirring in his sleep because he was having a bad dream of you being in that box and how you looked when they found you. Not liking how the dream was going it made him jump out of his sleep and his hand automatically started reaching out for you, but you weren't there next to him, so he searched around the bed and found nothing. Panic started to set in thinking something happened to you, but just as he was about to get out of the bed to look for you he heard the bathroom door opened and you emerged from it and he released a breath that he didn’t know he was holding. You just went to the bathroom. Coming back into the bedroom the light from the bathroom shone into the bedroom and you saw Ryan was sitting up in bed "Everything okay babe?" you asked him turning off the light and making your way back to bed "Yeah, I just got worried for bit when I felt you weren't next to me." he said and you got back in bed and turned on the bedside lamp to see his face. He was sweating, he clearly just had a nightmare, so you brought your hands up to his face "I just went to pee, want to talk about it?" "It was nothing major, just dreaming of you that's all." he told you but you knew it was more than that but you decided not to push "I'm fine." you told him with a smile and placed a tender kiss on his lips reassuring him. "Let's go back to sleep." you said laying back down and brought him with you. He laid his head on your chest and wrapped his arms tightly around you not to hurt you but afraid that you'll leave him, or that something bad might happen to you. You turned off the bedside lamp and wrapped your arms around Ryan and rubbed his back soothing him till you felt his breath even letting you know he was asleep. Knowing he was calm you allowed yourself to fall back into sleep. Several nights went like that, Ryan having nightmares and waking up looking for you, sometimes you were there, and times you weren't but eventually he phased out of it after talking to you about the nightmares.

            "It’s okay baby, I know it was scary time for us but remember I'm here with you okay and I hate seeing you like this." you told him honestly, cause it was eating way at you of how he was being, you hated seeing him worry "You're right. There is an idea I want to run by you and you can't say no, okay?" he asked and you nodded "Okay… what is it?" "The department is offering self-defense classes and I want you to take them, also I will teach you to shoot a gun, again you can't say no." he told you sternly leaving no room for argument, and you know he's just doing this to put his mind at ease knowing that when he isn't with you, that you can protect yourself "You got it, whatever you want. I will do it." telling Ryan this made him release a huge sigh making his heart lighter and the weight from his shoulders be lifted, he grabbed your face and planted a deep kiss on your lips "Thank you so much." he said smiling which you returned and pulled him into a hug comforting him. "Anything for you." you replied back. Feeling at ease Ryan felt a lot better and was in higher spirits "Ice cream?" he asked pulling away causing you to giggle at his randomness "Sure, why not." hearing your reply he took you up wrapping your legs around his waist and you took hold of the sudden movement and wrapped your arms around his neck. He walked you both to the kitchen and he placed you on top the counter parting himself from you going to the fridge, to retrieve the ice-cream. After getting the ice-cream he got a spoon and returned back to you. You reached out your hand to take it from him but he smacked your hand away "No no, I'm feeding you." he said pointing the spoon your direction making you giggle. And that's just what he did, he feed you while eating some himself "So are you ready for work tomorrow?" he asked getting another spoonful for you "Weirdly enough yes, I miss working." you said with a chuckle and Ryan joined "That's not weird, you love your job." he said feeding you another spoonful "I actually do." you agreed after swallowing the ice-cream. "But I should be asking you, are you ready for me to return to work tomorrow?" you asked him seriously crooking your head to the side waiting for his reply "I will be, because tomorrow I'm signing you up for the classes in the morning and I'm going to pick you up after you've finished work and take you back to the station so you can attend the classes and wait for you." you shook your head at him with a smile plastered on your lips "You really are something else." "I just really love my wife and want to know that she's taken care of when I'm not with her." he told you seriously "And thanks to you, I will be." you reassured him. Ryan made a promise to himself to place your safety above his own, so he felt awful when you got hurt knowing that he should have never allowed that to happen in the first place. So going forward he's making sure nothing ever will happen to you again, as long as he has something to do with it.
