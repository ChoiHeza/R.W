            You were currently in the living room, sitting on the couch, laptop on your lap, trying to fix a few bugs in your code for work tomorrow. Your husband, Ryan wasn't home from work as yet, he texted and said he would be a bit late that evening, so you weren't expecting to hear the apartment door open and a jingle of his keys followed by "Hey, hun, I'm home." "Living room." you shouted to him and then you saw him turn the corner entering the living room wearing everything minus his shoes which he left at the door. He took off his bag resting it on the side table along with his badge and gun. He was wearing a dark purple t-shirt along with dark jeans. While you were watching him remove his stuff, you noticed a dark mark on his face "Babe, what happened with your face?" you asked him placing down your laptop on the coffee table in front of you and made your way towards him "It's funny actually." he said with a chuckle, you took his face between your hands inspecting the bruise "I'm listening." you told him "I will tell you, but, how about a kiss from my beautiful wife first, because I haven't seen her since this morning." that made you smile. With his face still between your palms, you brought your lips to his connecting them in a sweet and tender kiss. "Hi" he said in a greeting voice after pulling apart "Hi" you greeted back with a bright smile. "So now I'm listening." you said leaving him and heading to the kitchen which he followed "Okay okay, have you ever heard of Roller Derby?" Ryan asked leaning against the island as you went to the fridge "I think I have. Is it when females roller skate around in a circle and beat the crap out of each other?" you went into the freezer to get a pack of frozen peas for Ryan's face. "That is actually spot on. Do you know how brutal those women are?" Ryan asked, like he was trying to justify himself, you approached him with the peas and placed them on his cheek and the light bulb went off in your head "One of them punched you, didn't they?" you asked him and he just sighed, you tried to hide your laugh "So how did you manage to get one of these brutal women to punch you?" you asked raising a brow at him "Walter and I had just got there and it was my first time seeing a place like that. While we were talking, a fight broke out." "Oh no babe, don't tell me you tried to stop them?" the look in Ryan's eyes answered your question and he continued explaining "I got between them trying to break it up and one of them sucker punched me in the face." you made an oou face feeling Ryan's pain "That really had to hurt, I'm sorry." you said removing the peas and giving his bruise a kiss "Nah, it was nothing." he told you clearly lying "Babe, it is okay if a punch from a woman hurts, they were bigger than you." he just rolled his eyes snatching the peas from your hand and placing it back on his cheek, that made you laugh "So what did you think of the sport?" you asked him getting on top the island counter to sit, just to appear a bit taller than Ryan. Although he was a small man, he was still taller than you. "Can I be honest?" he asked taking the peas from his face and resting them on the counter then folded his arms "Always" you told him waiting for his reply matching his folded arms "I low key liked it, I told Walter I found it terrifying and sexy." his reply caused you to chuckle. "What?" he asked coming in front of you placing his hands on the counter on either side of you "Nothing, it's just funny how you described it." you replied coming down from your laugh "That's where we went actually this evening. The victim was one of the players and there was a tribute for her, then they played a game in her honor." that soften your heart "That's really sweet." you gave him a soft smile and he nodded in agreement "It really was, but the game I really enjoyed, who knew." you placed your arms on his shoulders looking him directly in his eyes "What if I told you, I used to play back in the day?" you told him and that made his eyes go wide, and his hands immediately left the counter and went on your hips "You're kidding right?" he asked you with lit up eyes and you shook your head no "Are you serious?!" he asked with excitement laced in his voice and you nodded your head yes "We were the Bajan Tuff Gals." you told him trying to hide your smile at how excited he was right now "No way!" he was in utter disbelief "You, my small delicate wife, was a derby girl?" "Yes sir, I am tougher than I look." "How comes I never knew of this?" "You never asked." you said shrugging your shoulders. You looked at Ryan and saw wheels turning in his head and something flashed across his eyes "You’re trying to picture it aren’t you?" he nodded his head with a smirk on his lips "My wife is a lowkey badass, that's sexy." that made you smile, moving your hands from his shoulders to his neck, you pulled him in for a kiss, but a more heated one and Ryan just accepted the kiss willingly.  "You have pictures right?" he asked breaking the kiss "Of course, want to see them?" that response just made him happier "You don't even have to ask, but after this" "After what?" you asked but Ryan just placed his lips back on yours continuing the kiss, taking it to the next level. With his hands still on your hips, he pulled you forward making you wrap your legs around his waist and he took this opportunity to lift you off the counter and make his way to the bedroom not once breaking the kiss.

            Ryan was currently laying his head on your stomach listening to the random noises it made while your fingers were playing in his hair, then you remembered about the pictures "Still want to see the pictures?" you asked and that caused him to lift his head up and look at you "Yes babe" he told you with the brightest smile. You got up from the bed taking Ryan's shirt from the floor and putting it on, making your way to the living room to retrieve your laptop. Returning to the bedroom, you saw Ryan was sitting up with his back to the headboard waiting for your return, the sheet covering his bottom half leaving his top bare. You got back into bed next to him turning on your laptop "I must warn you, this is cringy young me we are about to see okay, so don’t be harsh on me." you told him with a stern look and a point of your finger "Okay baby." he said raising his hands in surrender and you just chuckled at his response. While going through your laptop for the photos Ryan placed himself behind you and started kissing your exposed neck "Found them!" you said which caused him to look over your shoulder at laptop and the biggest grin appeared on his face at the photo he saw. There you were in your helmet, team shirt, paddings, short plaid skirt, fishnet stockings and roller blades, in the photo you were with 2 other girls, and they were dressed the same as you but one had her helmet in her hands. Ryan whistled at the picture "Look at you, where is the cringe, I just see a very sexy Heather Amanda Wolfe." and you laughed at his response "How is it that I never knew this side of you." he said taking the laptop from your hands to inspect the photo more, zooming in on you "Do you have more?" "Just keep swiping right." you told him and he just went to town, inspecting every photo of you with a huge smile on his face the entire time "Enjoying yourself?" you asked him laughing "Very much so. I think I just fell in love with you all over again." he said looking up from the laptop and into your eyes and you would be lying to yourself if that didn't make you blush "Why you never told me about this?" he asked you looking back at the laptop one more time before closing it and returning his attention back to you "I guess I didn’t want to scare you off." and that response made Ryan laugh "You, scare me, says the woman that I found trapped on a ladder because of spiders." and that made you gasp "How dare you Mr. Wolfe, did you forget the size of those things." Ryan grabbed your hand pulling you towards him to straddle his lap as he went back to leaning against the headboard "I could never forget Mrs. Wolfe, because if it wasn't for your fear of spiders, I would have never been able to meet this amazing woman in front of me." he said placing one hand on the small of your back and the other on your neck pulling you to him for a kiss, you felt his love in that kiss. You pulled apart and an idea crossed your mind "I wonder if I should give derby another go." you saying that woke something up in Ryan "Gosh I love you." he said smashing his lips with yours and taking off his shirt you were wearing pulling you close against him once again.
