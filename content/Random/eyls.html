            You were finishing the last bit of bug fixes on your code before saving to go home. It was 11:43 that night when you decided to get up from your desk and call it a night. Logging off your computer and packing you bags you saw that they were two more coworkers still there, the new girl Stephanie and Brady the department head. "All finished Brady, I pushed the fixes to you, so I'm heading out." you told him slinging your bag over your shoulder and making your way their direction "Thanks Heather, you're a God send, I don't know what we would of done without you." he told you with a smile, "Just doing my job sir." you chuckled and then reached out your hand towards Stephanie "It was a great pleasure meeting you Stephanie, looking forward to working together in the future and building amazing things, once again welcome to the team." she took your hand and returned the shake "Thank you very much Heather, I'm looking forward to that as well." you both exchanged smiles and at that moment you felt your phone chime signaling you got a message. You checked and saw it was from Ryan 'Outside hun'. "Husband?" Brady asked, "Yeah, he's here so I'll see you guys tomorrow." you told them leaving "Don't forget I'm travelling in the morning, so you'll be in charge tomorrow." Brady told you as a reminder "Yes sir, safe flight." "Thanks bye" he replied and you left. Making your way down to the exit. Only a handful of people were still here but you only passed a cleaner working in the hallway before making your way down. Existing the building you saw Ryan was parked out front waiting for you. You made your way to the car and got in. You greeted your husband with a kiss "I hope you weren't home sleeping?" you asked him cause he usually finishes work in the evening time. "Nope, I finished an hour ago, the case carried on late." "That means you're off tomorrow?" "Yes mam." you got strapped in and Ryan pulled off "Ice cream?" Ryan asked cause that's a Friday night tradition for you guys. "Yes sir."

        <p class="story">
            You guys arrived at your usual ice cream parlor got your usual booth and ordered your favourites. You guys just talked about your day while enjoying your ice cream, you told him "There's a new girl, Stephanie, she came in from New York, she's gonna be a big help because we're going to be working together going forward." "That sounds nice, cause you work so hard, so I'm happy for you. Were you the last to leave there?" "Nah, I left her there along with Brady." convo just went on like usual til the ice cream was gone and you both made your way home and called it a night.
        </p>
        <p class="story">
            Your alarm went off waking you up. You released a huge sigh while saying "I really hate working on weekends." Ryan was still asleep next to you so you turned off the alarm, got up without waking Ryan, gave him a kiss and made your way to the bathroom to get ready for work. It was 4 30 in the morning and you had to get work for 6. You had to get there first and early to prepare the load of the day since Brady left you in charge. Emerging from the bathroom 20 mins later you saw Ryan was already out of bed, and figured he was in the kitchen preparing breakfast. With your towel wrapped around your body you made your way to the closet and got dressed in some sweats and one of Ryan shirts, one that was too small for him and that would be your work clothes for the day, because on weekends you guys aren’t required to dress up. After dressing you made your way to the kitchen. "Good morning husband of mine." you said with a huge smile entering the kitchen and making your way to Ryan  wrapping your arms around him from behind, "Good morning beautiful." he was busy pouring coffee into two mugs. After finished he turned in your arms and grabbed your face placing a passionate kiss on your lips, giving you a wide grin afterwards. "Slept well?" he asked you, "Not enough" you replied with a sigh and he agreed "I'm gonna go wash up and drop you to work, okay." you told him okay and started using your breakfast.
        </p>
        <p class="story">
            After breakfast you guys left, Ryan was off today so he just dropped you off and returned home. "Have a good day today baby, call when you're finished." "I will." you guys shared a parting kiss and you left him giving him a final wave before entering the building. You made it up to your floor and saw Stella the receptionist there "Stella!" you greeted her brightly and she returned the energy "Heather!" she greeted you back, so you stopped there by her and talked for a bit, you were still early, she said no one came in as yet. You guys chatted for a full 10 mins before leaving her at her desk making your way to the office. Swiping your badge the door opened and you entered making a beeline to your desk without really looking around. You placed down your stuff and decided to take a walk around the room to make sure everything was in order, and while walking you saw someone laying on their desk, and getting closer your realized it was the new girl Stephanie, "Stephanie, what are you doing here so early?" you said approaching her desk, but you got no movement or response from her, it was only until you got there that you realized there was a pool of blood on her desk, and her head was faced down on the desk, "Stephanie?" you called out again reaching for her head to turn it, and that's when you realized her eyes were wide staring back at you, she was dead. Fear over took and you quickly left the office making your way to Stella. "Call 911, it's Stephanie." she didn’t hesitate and called, she gave you the phone and you explained everything, and they said units are on the way.

            Ryan was home when he got the call that he was needed at a crime scene, he dressed quickly and made his way to work where he would ride with Delko to the scene. "Hey man, you good?" Delko asked him as Ryan approached "Was supposed to be my day off." Ryan replied and Delko chuckled "I feel you man." they got in the hummer and made their way to the scene, with Delko driving he filled Ryan in "Female, appears to be dead from last night, her body was found this morning by a coworker." they arrived at the building, and that caught Ryan's attention because this where his wife works, and he was just here this morning. "It's here?" Ryan asked just to make sure "Yeah, why?" Delko responded as they got out getting their kits "It's just that I know someone that works here." Ryan said, he didn't say it was you, his wife because no one knows that he's married but Horatio. He kept it a secret for your safety. In his mind he's thinking that it's not you because he saw you this morning and that you're fine. "Everything okay Wolfe?" Delko asked Ryan seeing his face looked like it paled. "Yeah, yeah, a thought just entered my mind. It's nothing." Ryan replied with a reassuring smile towards Delko and which he took. They made their way inside and got in the elevator, without thinking Ryan pushed the number to your floor and that caught Eric's attention "How did you know that was the right floor?" he asked catching Ryan off guard, he didn't even realize "Sorry man, I just did it out of habit, like I said, I know someone that works here." fear began to set in again in Ryan's mind, the crime scene is on your floor, but he saw you this morning, so you’re fine. The elevator ride felt like it took forever to Ryan. It finally reached your floor they both got off and they were greeted by Stella. "Good morning." That was until she looked up from her computer and saw it was Ryan "Ryan! You're a CSI, I had no idea." she said and Ryan greeted her back "Hey Stella, yes I am." he replied her question then he turned to Delko "This is CSI Delko." she greeted him "Was it you that found the victim?" Delko asked getting straight into work and that question made Stella look towards Ryan "It was actually your wife that found her." oh no, Ryan immediately knew that you weren't doing well but relieved that you weren't the victim. Her reply confused Delko, 'wife' he thought "Heather found her?" Stella nodded her head "Where is she?" "Down the hall, should be in front the office, some officers were questioning her." with that Ryan excused himself and went to find you, Delko followed behind after giving a thanks to Stella. When Ryan saw you, you were hunched over with your head in your hands, so he called out to you "Heather!" you heard his voice and looked up, seeing that he was coming towards you, you got up and ran to him, falling into his embrace, holding onto him tightly. Eric was a bit surprised at the situation and watched with a bit of distance from you guys. Ryan took your face into his hands inspecting you, making sure you were okay, he asked you what happened and you explained everything to him "Stephanie, the new girl?" you nodded replying to him and he took you back into his embrace. Breaking the moment you heard someone clearing their throat and when you look another man was standing there, you assumed he was another CSI that worked with Ryan. You two broke apart and Ryan signaled Eric forward "Delko, this is my wife Heather, Heather this is CSI Delko." he introduced you two and you shook hands, Eric was surprised and couldn't stop smiling "Nice to finally meet you Eric, I've heard a lot about you." you told him and he looked towards Ryan quickly before looking back to you "I wish I could say the same, didn’t know you existed let alone Wolfe being married." Ryan and Eric exchanged some looks before Ryan stepped away from you "Babe, Delko is going to ask you some questions, and I'll be right inside with H, okay?" you nodded and gave him a reassured smile which he returned with a forehead kiss and left you two alone. "Well, this is just standard procedure, so no hard feelings okay?" "It’s okay, I understand." "Good, so let's start from the beginning, what happened when you found her this morning?" he asked you and you told him what happened, down to every little detail, making sure to leave out nothing. "Were you here last night?" he asked you writing in his notepad "Yeah, I left here before 12 last night.  I wasn't alone though, I left Stephanie and our department head Brady here still working." he jotted that info down "Was anything out of the ordinary last night?" "No, I waited til Ryan arrived and then left, but last night there was nothing out of the ordinary, just the usual cleaners in the hall and around the building." "Okay, and you didn't come back to work last night?" "No, after leaving work every Friday Ryan and I would go for ice cream then home. He should have the receipt and you could also go to the parlor and ask to make sure I was there." he nodded and jotted it down, he continued asking you more questions about Stephanie which you gave few info because yesterday was your first time meeting her. "That's all, thanks Heather, if anything comes up or we need you, we'll give you a call, okay?" "Okay, I understand." he sent a smile your way which you returned and at that moment Ryan came out the office and approached you two "Finished?" "Yeah, she was very co-operative, she told me of a receipt that I'll just need you to give me too just clear her." "Sure" Ryan pulled out his wallet and searched for the receipt and gave it to Eric, which he inspected and deemed you clear. "I told H I didn’t want to work the case being a bit close to it, so he suggest I switch places with Natalia, so she should be on her way here." "Okay, I'll keep you filled in though." they discussed some stuff before nodding a later "Come on babe, let's go." you got your bag and bidding Eric a bye and left with Ryan.

        <p class="story">
            He reached out his hand for you to take which you laced your fingers with as you guys walked to the elevator "Since I have another crime scene to be at I won't be able to drop you home, so I'll have an officer take you if that's okay." "I don’t mind." you gave him a reassured smile. You guys told Stella bye on your way out. Ryan pressed the button calling the elevator and you both waited "You sure you're going to be okay babe?" Ryan asked looking towards you "I'll be fine, just need some rest and quiet and I'll be perfect again." "That's my girl." he said giving you a kiss which you returned, and at that moment the elevator dinged open making you both break apart "Ryan?" you heard a voice and looked in that direction "Natalia! You got here quickly." Ryan said addressing the woman, she looked between you two and Ryan caught on "Oh, I'm sorry, Natalia this is my wife Heather and Heather this is CSI Boa Vista." you reached out and you both greeted each other, and it was the same as with Eric cause no one knew of you "Wow, Ryan is married, okay then." she was very surprised but just sent bright smiles your way. "I will fill in you guys later, just spare me please." Ryan told her while getting into the elevator with you. "We'll try." she replied turning around and going to join Eric, downstairs Ryan made sure you got in the cop car and left safely while he made his way to work.

            Upstairs Natalia met with Eric, he saw her coming and could read her face "I know right." he said as she approached him "Ryan, is married, and to a Queen at that. Did you see how gorgeous she was?" "I am in awe as much as you, did not see that one coming." They exchanged words some more about the situation while getting to work.
        </p>
        <p class="story">
            The day had passed and the murder was solved but you had to come in to collect some of your belongings because they were a part of the investigation and at that same time you and Ryan agreed it was time that he introduced you to the team. All his coworkers were in a lab near the entrance to the elevator just waiting for your arrival, they were all so ecstatic and just couldn’t believe the news, Ryan entered the room with Walter and everyone turned towards their direction placing Ryan in the spotlight "So Ryan, is it really true, that you're married?" Calleigh asked which caused Walter to whiplash towards Ryan direction cause this is his first time hearing about it "What?! Wolfe is married?!" he was in disbelief, Ryan just sighed "Yes, guys I'm really married" "Why didn't we know anything?" asked Eric, "Wanted to keep her safe,  I just remembered what happened with H's wife, your sister. I just didn’t want to risk anything." they all nod their head in understanding "Sucks we missed out on the wedding" Natalia said "We didn’t had a wedding really, plus I didn’t know you yet." Ryan told her and that opened another can of worms  "Wait wait…. I've been working here for 4 years." Natalia stated "So our Ryan has been married for a while." Calleigh said with a wide smile "How long have you guys been together?" Eric asked and before Ryan could of replied he caught a glimpse of you in the hallway, "Excuse me." he left them immediately meeting you in the hallway "Hey there beautiful." he greeted you with arms outstretched and you entered his embrace and greeted him back.
        </p>
        <p class="story">
            From inside the others were watching the scene in front of them, it was so foreign, to see their coworker Ryan Wolfe like this "So that's her, wow, you guys weren't kidding, she is gorgeous" Calleigh said looking you over, "I know right." Natalia said "And she's shorter than him." Delko said which cause them all to laugh, cause they always teased him about his height. "No way that's Ryan's wife." Walter said "I know man, it is hard to believe Ryan is married." Eric replied back to him "No, that's not what I meant. Ryan, basic white boy Ryan pulled a gorgeous black queen. That's what I meant, how did he manage to do that." they all agreed with him.

        <p class="story">
            While in the hallway talking to Ryan you were looking around the lab inspecting it until your eyes landed on a room where they were a bunch of eyes staring back at you and the moment they saw you they all turned around acting like nothing happened, you brought this to Ryan's attention "Babe, they were a bunch of people over there staring at me." you told him pointing in the direction that they are. Ryan just sighed and said "They are my coworkers, they're just really excited to finally meet you, come let's meet them." he said taking your hand in his and leading you towards the room where a bunch of curious individuals waited. Upon entering you were greeted with a lot of wide smiles and you could just feel the excitement radiating off of them "Come on guys, don't freak her out." Ryan told them and they all replied with a sorry "It's okay babe." you touched his arm reassuring him. "Guys as you know, this is my wife, Heather." Ryan introduced you to them and he did the same back, you shaking each of their hands. "It feels like I know all of you already, but it's finally nice to put faces to names." Ryan has told you all about his coworkers, you just didn't know what they looked like "Heather I really have to ask cause it's killing me, how did Ryan land such a queen like yourself?" Walter asked and Natalia slapped his arm but you just laughed telling her it was okay "We actually met on my first week here in Miami, I had just not to long moved because of a job." they all listened intently as you told them of how you guys meet due to the spiders and there was laughter among them at the situation, "Wait, so she's spider girl?" Eric asked with recognition and Ryan nodded "I'm surprised you remembered that. That was eight years ago." "How could I forget, you first talked about how big these spiders were and then you would not shut up about her, on how gorgeous, beautiful and sweet she was, even though you literally just met her." Eric said and that caused you to look towards Ryan "You were that obsessed with me?" you asked him and you saw his ears got red and he scratched the back of his neck replying "No I wasn't, Eric is just exaggerating." with a scoff and you knew he was lying "Trust me Heather, he was obsessed." Eric and you shared a nod "Eric said that was eight years ago, so you guys have been together for that long?" Natalia asked and you replied with a nod of your head "We dated for two years and have been married for six." you told them and they were all just so surprised and some were smiling, exchanging money amongst themselves "Wait, you guys betted on how long we've been together for?" Ryan asked looking around at them "Kind of." Calleigh said with a sly smile "Who won?" you asked now curious "Heather, don't encourage them." you shrugged and turned back to them "Calleigh betted you were together for 6-7 years, while Natalia and I said 3-4 years." and you laughed and Ryan just shook his head. "How about we get out of here and go to dinner, invite the Wolfe couple and get to know Mrs. Wolfe?" Walter asked mostly directing the question towards you "I would absolutely love that, let it be my treat for you guys working so hard all the time." you told them with a big smile which they all cheered to and made their way out the room towards the elevator, you and Ryan hanged back for a bit "You know you don't have to do this right?" he said with a look on his face holding you at your hips, so you placed your hands on his chest "I want to. I am happy to finally meet the team, and it would be nice to reward you guys for putting away bad guys all day, plus I want them to love me." you told him with a genuine smile, and those words leaving your mouth just made Ryan fall in love with you even more "No one can love you as much as me." "I can try." you told him and he just shook his head no three times while saying "No no no." causing you to chuckle and he leaned in capturing your lips to leave a love filled kiss "You love birds coming?" Walter shouted out causing you two to break apart and laugh "Coming!" Ryan yelled back taking his hand in yours leading you both out through the door to join the rest in the elevator.
