            Being deep in sleep you were woken up by Ryan placing kisses all over your body. It's one of his favourite ways to wake you up, and it being the day off for both of you, he was looking forward to having you to himself for the whole day. It was his first off day in 2 weeks and he was not going to waste any of it. Peaking your eyes open you checked the clock on the bedside table to read the time, 8:24 A.M.. You closed back your eyes so they can wake up fully but that didn’t stop Ryan from his assault. He moved from your stomach coming higher to pepper kisses in your neck and he did it in a tickling way causing you to giggle letting him know that you're awake, he leaned up and looked at you but your eyes were still closed "Good morning gorgeous." he said kissing your cheek causing you to hum "Good morning." you finally opened your eyes and met a very wide awake Ryan ready to start his day with you but you were still super tired from last night, and not because of the reason you think, work finished way later than usual. His awake look made you groan and you closed back your eyes throwing your arm over your face to cover them, and Ryan just chuckled at your action "It's okay babe, take your time, I have all day. I can just keep giving you loving till then." he started back with his assault of kisses on your body, starting from your neck making his way down, then back up and it was killing you with his teasing. When he reached back up to your neck he removed your arm from your face and continued his kisses there. He kissed everywhere leaving your lips last cause he know that's where you wanted it most, so when he finally placed his lips on yours you caved and he took initiative to deepen the kiss. Wanting to take hold of the situation you flipped Ryan over to straddling his hips and he looked up at you with a smug look, he was so enjoying this. You connected back your lips to continue the deep kiss holding his face in your hands while his hands ran up and down your legs. Leaving his mouth it was now your turn to assault his body with kisses, starting with his face then made your way down, when you reach his chest his phone started to ring, groaning Ryan reached for it, in case it was work, but you don't stop what you're doing. Looking at the caller id he swore under his breath before answering "This is Wolfe" he said into the phone while you continued your assault down his body. It was a little while before he spoke again "Okay, I'll be there." he hang up and sighed heavily making you stop what you were doing to sit up and look at him, the look on his face told you it all "Work?" you asked and he just nodded his head with a sigh, this was so not how his day was supposed to go. You leaned down once more and placed a deep kiss on his lips which you know he wants to take further but you have to stop him. "Come on, get up." you said getting up off of him a bit disappointed and sad but you understood that his job was important so you don’t mind it. After you got up, Ryan sat up starting to contemplate life "Go shower and I'll get your things for you." you leaned down and kissed his forehead before making your way to the closet to get clothes for him, he usually lets you dress him because he has no fashion sense whatsoever. He watched you walked over to the closet wearing only a pair of knickers and one of his t-shirts which you took from the chair nearby. It hurts him to leave you like this knowing you both were supposed to be together all day, and you just look absolutely stunning before him. With a heavy heart and a sigh, Ryan got up and made his way to the bathroom for a quick cold shower.

            After you finished picking out his clothes, a blue t-shirt and a pair of dark jeans, got his bag, placing what you know he would need in it. Then you got his gun and badge from the safe placing it beside his bag, for when he was dressed, to gear himself with. Leaving the bedroom you made way to the kitchen and made coffee for him placing it in his cup. By the time you were finished pouring Ryan entered the kitchen, dressed in the clothes you left for him along with his gun and badge looking official and his bag in hand ready to go. "Coffee's finished." you gestured holding the cup. He smiled and you both made your way to the front door. You took his bag from him so he could put on his shoes, and before taking them from you, he grabbed your hips pulling you towards him, then wrapping his arms around your waist "Can't I just ditch, forget my responsibilities and stay home with you." he said with a skulk, you shook your head and giggle "No, they need you. Hurry and catch the bad guy so you can return home to me." you said with a nod which he returned, releasing you from his grasp he took the bag from you placing it on his shoulder and the mug from your hand. With his free right hand he placed it on your neck pulling you into him for a kiss. With this kiss you know he really didn't want to leave you, but you can't encourage him or he won't leave. So you pulled away causing him to groan "Go Ryan. The quicker you leave, the quicker you return." "You're right. I'm going I'm going." he said opening the door to leave but not before giving you one more quick kiss making you smile. You told him bye and closed the door locking it behind him.

            When Ryan arrived he realized he was called in because Natalia was a no show. Arriving on the crime scene he was met with Eric who was surprised to see him "I thought today was your off day?" Eric asked as Ryan approached "It was, my first off day in two weeks, but Natalia didn't show up." Eric chuckled at Ryan's expense but he understood the pain "Is Mrs. Wolfe mad, that her husband got taken from her?" Ryan shook his head "She isn't, but I saw she was a little disappointed. I think I'm more disappointed than her, but she understands." and Eric laughed "Been there man." he sympathized with Ryan. They got to work and he caught Ryan up on the situation, that's when he found out the suspect was one of the convicted felons that escaped prison a while back. Ryan asked around to see if anyone heard from Natalia, and found it weird that no one did, so he try contacting her himself several times but no response. After a while they managed to find out that she was kidnapped by the same felon, so they worked to track him down. In the meanwhile a woman was suspected to be killed by said felon.

            When Natalia was found and returned, after spending some time with the felon she had a gut feeling that maybe he wasn’t the killer so that lead to new evidence being surfaced. Ryan went to the lab to find out some info on a piece of evidence and he was met by Molly who was processing it. "Hey." Ryan said entering the lab "Hey, can you imagine meeting a random stranger online." Molly said because that's how the victim got killed, by meeting someone random online "Yeah, I could imagine it. I may have met one or maybe two people online." he chuckled to himself and Molly returned with a giggle fake judging him, but Ryan didn't catch on that she was flirting with him but before she could of said anything else, Ryan got a message that he was needed elsewhere. The rest of the day Molly flirted with Ryan but he was completely oblivious to it.

            After wrapping up the case and while signing some paperwork came a knock at the door that made Ryan look towards the direction of the sound, it was Molly "Hey, you need something?" Ryan asked looking back at the files in front of him, the faster he can get these finished the sooner he can return to you "Besides your horrible experience in meeting people online, would it be okay if I asked you out for a cup of coffee, after work?" Molly asked with a hopeful look in her eyes, she mistook Ryan being nice to her as him flirting back. Now catching on, Ryan looked up from the files with an apologetic look "I'm sorry Molly, if I gave you the wrong impression. I'm married." her face formed an oh not expecting that reply but she tried to play it off "I'm sorry, I hadn't noticed. I never saw a ring." she said gesturing to his finger "I do wear it but just not at work, or on the job, to keep her safe." he said lifting the chain from under his shirt to reveal the ring that hung on it "How long have you guys been married?" she asked now curious because she never heard anyone talk about a Mrs. Wolfe "Six years." Ryan replied tucking the chain back in his shirt and her face held shock because she would never had guess that long. She apologized once again which Ryan said it was okay, was a total misunderstanding. Then she left bidding him a good evening.

            Ryan had just finished up the last set of paper work and was making his way across the lab to the elevator with his phone in hand about to call you when he saw H in front of a white bored with the 5 felons on it. He entered the room and asked "What's going on H?" Horatio turned to look at him then back to the bored "We've got three of the guys, and two still remain at large. We're proposing a man hunt, and we'll need all the help we can get." Ryan could not disagree with that, the quicker those men were off the street the safer it would be, especially for you. It's always Ryan's goal to keep you safe. He turned to Horatio with his sure answer "You can count me in H, but you'll have to excuse me so I can make a call first." and H nodded. Leaving the room Ryan pulled up your contact and hit call, phone to his ear, he listened for your voice "Hello hello." you answered into the phone, Ryan knew you didn’t look at the caller id so that meant you were busy with something, because you only answer 'hello hello' when you answer the phone blindly "Hey beautiful." Ryan said with a smile at hearing your voice for the first time since this morning "Hey you, all finished with work?" there was a hopefulness in your voice that broke Ryan's heart "Yeah, I was, we found the guy, but H wants to organize a man hunt for the rest of the escaped felons and he needs all the help he can get." Ryan told you expected to hear disappointment, in your voice, maybe a little anger but there was none when you spoke "That's a good idea hun, you should help. I would definitely feel a lot safer knowing that those guys were captured." you told him sincerely and Ryan just couldn’t help but smile, you understood when it came to his job and that just made him love you even more "You always know how to make me fall deeper in love with you." that made you giggle" And I love you baby, now go do what you do best and catch the bad guys, while being careful, got it?" "Yes mam, your order is my command." "Good, I'm currently here making diner, so just call before you come home so I can reheat it for you okay?" "You got it and I promise I'll make it up to you for ditching you today." "I'll hold you to that, now go, I love you CSI Wolfe." you chimed into the phone making a smile grow onto Ryan's face "And I love you Mrs. Wolfe. Be good." "Always." you replied and Ryan hung up. Pocketing his phone he returned back to H giving him his full attention "So where do we start?" Ryan asked and they got down to business.
