            "Hun, I'm home." Ryan said entering the apartment and was met with complete silence. 'Were you not home yet?' he thought to himself, you were usually home before him and he hasn’t gotten a message from you letting him know that you'll be late. Taking off his shoes and resting down his bag, he searched the apartment for any sign of you and came up with nothing. Pulling out his phone from his pocket he decided to give you a call, but before he had chance to dial your number, you were calling him, what a coincidence "Hey hun, where are you?" "Hey babe, sorry for not calling. I got carried away with work and forgot to call. I'm going to be late today, there was a crash on one of the servers." there was a sigh in your voice that Ryan didn't miss "I'm sorry to hear, do you know how long you'll be?" "Maybe two more hours, but I'll call when I'm about to leave." you told him while sitting at your desk hurting your head "Okay, I'll listen out for your call. Be good." "Always." and Ryan heard you hung up. With Ryan being super busy lately with work he didn't get to spend much time with you so he decided to do something special for you, while he waits till you get home.

            After a long grueling hours of work and rectifying everything, you could finally leave this place. You quickly called Ryan and told him you were leaving. "Okay babe, be careful." "Will do, see you in a bit." you hung up, made your way out the building, to your car, then home. Reaching the apartment complex and parking, you got out the car after picking up your bag. While making way to your shared apartment you felt your phone chimed so you checked it and saw it was a message from Ryan 'When you reach the apartment, just knock and I'll open the door for you' you replied back with a raised brow and an okay. Ryan is being very suspicious, you have your keys and the keypad works just fine but brushing that aside you just did what you were told. So when you reached the apartment you knocked and there was a few moments before the door opened revealing a very wide grinning Ryan and in his hands was a bouquet of flowers. With a smile and raised brow you entered the apartment also with your mind racing a mile a minute thinking if you forgot any special days. Ryan must have read your mind because he stopped the brain meltdown "No babe, it's not a special day or anniversary." you entered and Ryan closed the door for you. You quickly took off your shoes and rest down your bag. Looking back up at Ryan being closer to him you saw he had a cut on his brow, so, worried you closed the distance between you two and took his face in your palms "What happened?" you asked inspecting his face but he reassured you it was nothing serious "I'll tell you at dinner." you nodded and stepped away from him, going back to your previous emotions "These are for you my beautiful queen." he said handing the flowers towards you which you accepted and took a whiff, "These are gorgeous and they smell lovely." you told him with a wide smile admiring the flowers "When I went to the flower shop and the lady asked me what kind of flowers I wanted, I told her the most gorgeous ones she have to match my wife, also showed her a picture of you. She said you were gorgeous by the way." Ryan said smiling wide and you couldn’t help but cover your smile from the way you were blushing so hard "You just love to show me off don't you." before replying Ryan took you in his arms holding you at the hips then ran his hands up to your waist and clasping them in the back pulling you closer to him, you moved the flowers out of the way so they won't be crushed, then he leaned in and replied each word with a kiss "Every" kiss "Chance" kiss "I" kiss "Get" kiss, then he looked at you with the most passionate eyes ever.

            "So may I ask Mr. Wolfe, what might we be celebrating or what is the occasion?" you asked just out of curiosity "I am celebrating the fact that I have to world's best wife." he told you honestly but you wanted to tease a little "You sure? And not because you did something wrong?" you asked with a raised brow trying to hide your smile, but he caught on and played along so he released a very big fake gasp "Heather, how could you? I would never ever do anything to hurt you. I am hurt." he released you and placed both hands how his chest feigning hurt and you just laughed. You were like that for a while cause it was a funny sight to see. Coming down from your high you turned back to him "Well I very much love the flowers. Thank you." you told him truthfully placing a sweet kiss on his cheek and started to head to the kitchen but he grabbed your elbow halting you "Wait, where are you going?" "To the kitchen to put the flowers in water." and he shook his head "No need, I already have a vase set up." he said lacing his fingers with yours and tugged you along. He lead you to the dining room and when you got there you immediately gasp, the table was set up for a romantic dinner, candles were lit everywhere, and lights were dimmed, it was gorgeous how the room was decorated "You did this?" you asked Ryan looking towards his direction to see that he was already looking at you with love filled eyes and he replied with a nod saying "Yeah, anything for my queen." he placed a kiss on your cheek while you went back to admiring the room. There being caught up in the moment Ryan took the flowers from you and placed them in the vase he had on the table. Breaking out of your daze you made your way to the table still in complete awe. You watched as Ryan pulled out a chair for you which you sat in. "Now, as you may know I am not the best cook, but I can make a mean mac and cheese." he told you disappearing into the kitchen causing you to giggle at his statement. He then emerged with two plates in hand, placing one in front of you and the other where he was going to sit, adjacent to you. Looking at the meal in front of you, it looked just as delicious as it always does whenever Ryan cooks it. As he was sitting you reached forward grabbing his hand in yours making him look at you "This is perfect Ryan." it really was, you couldn’t have asked for anything better.

            After the food was gone there was just wine remaining in both your glasses that you were drinking from while talking to each other "I wish you had told me about this surprise dinner date, I would have dressed very fancy." you told him looking down at your clothes, you wore to work today a red polo shirt along with a pair of dark jeans. "I see nothing wrong with how you look, you look beautiful as always." Ryan said with a smirk and you just rolled your eyes and shook your head taking a sip from your glass "You've heard me complain about my day, how was yours?" you saw the news that one of the escaped fugitives, Dante Kroll was killed, but you wanted to hear Ryan's side, the part that wasn't on the news. He turned to you all excited to tell you "As you may have saw that we killed one of the fugitives." you nodded for him to continue "We thought his original plan was to kill an old teammate but that wasn't the case. The rest were at the fight arena surveilling the place looking for Dante to stop him, while I was doing detective work and we went to his hideout." you had to pause him for a minute "You didn’t get to go, I know you would of enjoyed that." you said chuckling and Ryan nodded along "I got there eventually though. We wanted more on Dante so we found his hideout, I had to go and investigate and I asked Molly to join me in the field, so we could look through the place for clues. That's when I found a blueprint of the place and realized it was the vault of the place that he had circled." he had the widest smile on his face at how proud he was "Well I can't take all the credit because the blueprint was faded out and Molly restored it there so we knew what his actual plans were." you were really proud of him, cause you know how much he loves his job but something new caught your ears so you will address it "I'm really proud of you but I have to ask, Molly?" you said with a raised brow "Oh right, I never told you of her, she's a new CSI that's working in the lab." he told you, it's not that you don't trust Ryan, cause you do, it's the people around him, cause he is an awfully nice and funny person and that can come off as flirting when he is completely oblivious to it, Ryan sensed your silence that you were thinking something wrong and your mind was running a mile a minute "You don't have anything to worry about hun, she asked me out but I turned her down and told her I was married and just explained the no ring thing on my part but I did show her the ring though and apologized for misleading her and giving her the wrong idea." Ryan reassured taking his hand in yours "I trust you Ryan, I know you wouldn't do anything. It's just your personality, it's so hard not to love, and you just be completely oblivious to girls flirting with you." you told him with a little laugh, because it is true and he just rolled his eyes "But if she does become a problem." you gave him a look and he finished your sentence for you "I will know exactly who to call." he said lifting your hand to his lips to leave a light kiss "You may continue."

            He told you how it all went down and how he got the cut, it was from Dante "Is it because you have such a punch able face?" you asked trying to hide your laugh and Ryan just smiled and shook his head "I don't mind, that just means that my wife gets to take extra care of me and shower my bruises in kisses." he said head held high and no shame in his voice and you released your laugh getting up. You went and stood next to Ryan and he turned in his chair towards you. You leaned down and placed tender kiss on his lips and stood back up pulling him into you. He wrapped his arms around you and placed his head against your stomach while you played with his hair "You did very good today Ryan. You helped get a fugitive off the streets and prepared a very beautiful evening for your wife. You did all of that in one day." you said looking down at him and he looked up at you, wide smile on your face. Ryan stood and joined you, arms never leaving your waist "Who I am today is because of you Heather. You make me want to be a better version of myself each and every day. I want to be the best husband for you. I never want to give you doubt that I don’t love you or that you aren't enough for me. Because in my eyes, you deserve the world, and that's what I've tried to achieve every moment I'm with you. I love you so much Heather Wolfe, I am in love with you. Or as the team would say, mostly Delko, I'm obsessed with you" Ryan told you with his all and everything and a little chuckle at the end. Your heart just felt so warm and full, looking at this amazing man in front of you that you can call your husband, that you love with your all as well and have to never worry about him hurting you. Honestly you fell in love with him all over again and boy were you down bad for him. Tears started to slowly make way to your eyes but you tried your best to blink them away with a light chuckle "You can't be saying these things so out of the blue. Catching me off guard in my feelings." Ryan wiped away a tear that managed to roll down your cheek "Never." he said shaking his head "I will never stop telling you how I feel about you, and how you make me feel." that statement made you lost it and the tears spilled but at the same time you couldn't stop smiling. "I am in love you with you too Ryan." you said planting your lips on him despite your messy face and Ryan didn't care not one bit, because the love of his life was kissing him right now and also, she was madly in love with him.
