            It's been a month since the move and you haven't encountered any spiders which you are very thankful for, but maybe you have spoken too soon. It has also been a month since you've seen Officer Wolfe, you had hoped that you would of ran into him, cause you're not gonna lie you had a thing for him although you knew nothing about him but it would have been nice to see him again to at least ask him out this time and get to know him. You arrived home unlocked your door and went in, placed down your things and realized you forgot to check the mailbox, taking your keys you made your way to the mailbox and got the mail, returning back to the house right in the middle of your front door pathway, there it was, a giant spider, you jumped and just couldn’t believe your luck, and your phone was inside so you couldn't get to it to make a call, you just sighed and decided to go to a neighbor for some help as you were making your way next door the next best thing came into view, a patrol car was making its way towards you, so you decided to flag it down, the vehicle stopped right next to you, and you looked in and you were so surprised to see who it was "Officer Wolfe!" you said surprised with such a wide smile, that you were honestly trying to hide but failed miserably, but Ryan didn't mind one bit because gosh he missed that smile and he gladly return it "Heather! What a surprise." he remembered you, you did a little dance inside "You remembered me?" "How could I forget, those were big spiders." he said that but that wasn't the reason he remembered you, it was because how could he ever forget a face as gorgeous as yours. "It’s funny that you mentioned spiders." you chuckled a bit "What's wrong, why did you flag me down?" "Spider." you sighed and he just laughed, it was just too funny. He parked the car and got out, "So what are you doing out here?" he asked joining you, "I had to move, after you left the pest control guy told me the house was probably infested so he suggested that I moved, so this is where I moved too." you told him as you led him back to your home "I'm sorry that happened." you just sighed, when you got back to the house you saw that the spider had made his way into your home. "So what happened?" he asked you seeing the spider in your home, you told him and hearing yourself saying it out loud you just couldn’t believe your luck. "Wow Heather, these guys seem to really like you. I'll call pest control for you." you thanked him "I would really like them not to.", Ryan gave them a call and gave them your address and explained the situation. He said a thanks into the phone and hung up. "They'll be here shortly, I'll keep you company till they arrive." "Thank you so much, I bet I'll have to move again and even if he doesn’t suggest it, I'm moving either way." you just laughed at the situation you're in and Ryan joined, Ryan decided that this was fate that you both met again, so he isn’t going to miss this opportunity "If you don't mind, I can help you in finding a place, I've lived here all my life." he told you and your insides did a little scream, that statement made you so happy, "Yes, I would greatly appreciate it."

            You guys talked about your stay so far in Miami till pest control arrived and funny enough it was the same guy again and he recognized you both and made a joke about the spiders being attracted to you. He did his thing, the same as last time, but Ryan stayed to the very end this time, and you both bid the man a thanks and bye. You and Ryan exchanged numbers and he said he was off tomorrow so were you so you both decided to meet tomorrow morning for breakfast and then go place hunting. When Ryan left, you did a dance, and you just couldn’t believe your luck.

            You guys met for breakfast and he told you he had some good news. "If you want, a tenant moved out this morning and her apartment is up for rent in my building. We could go and check it out, that's only if you want?" "Of course let's check it out, maybe an apartment is what I need instead of a house, and you live there, so that means no spiders but if they are, I would know who exactly to call." you both just laughed, but after eating you both went and checked it out and you found out it was on the same floor as him just 2 doors down, and the apartment was gorgeous and had an amazing view, plus Ryan lived here so you didn’t think twice of taking the place, you signed the papers and made your downpayment wasting no time, making sure it was okay with Ryan and he didn’t mind one bit, he was actually happy.

            The very same day you moved in, Ryan helped you with all your stuff and got you all settled and then asked you out to dinner the night, which you gladly accepted. That's how it went, you guys hanging out as friends first and just getting to know each other. He took you around Miami to all the great sites and showing you what it had to offer. This went on for four months before he officially decided to ask you out on a proper date which you accepted and from that night you guys got together making your relationship official.
