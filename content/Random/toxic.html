        "Whoa, why are you wearing clothes?" Ryan asked as he just entered back
        the bedroom. You released a small laugh at his question "Because I can't
        go to work naked?" you said but more like questioned and you saw Ryan
        think for a moment so you turned fully towards him and pointed a finger
        "No Ryan, never happening." so he held up his hands in defense before
        speaking "Okay, but why are you going to work. I thought it was your day
        off?" Ryan asked coming over to you "It was, but while you were in the
        kitchen I got a call to come in because Dave called in sick." you said
        and Ryan took hold of your waist "Annoyed?" Ryan asked looking down at
        you so you shook your head while bringing your hands up to rub his arms
        "Not one bit. You know I love my job." you told him with a smile which
        he returned "So I get to spend the day with you." Ryan said causing you
        to shake your head "Lucky me." you said as a joke with a roll of your
        eyes and Ryan's grip on your waist tightened "I know you don't mean
        that." Ryan said and you shrugged just smiling up at him and he just
        shook his head smiling as well before giving you a kiss.

      <p class="story">
        Today's case involved a bio attack of a deadly toxin being released in a
        room killing the people inside, but it turned out that that was just a
        test run and they were planning on releasing it on a much larger scale,
        so you were currently looking for locations that could be targeted based
        on information the team has been providing you "Hey babe, any luck?"
        Ryan asked as he entered the room and you released a sigh "I'm trying
        but no, the information I have is still very vague so the search scope
        is still pretty large. Please tell me you come with more info?" you said
        looking toward him with hopeful eyes as he stood next to you "I do
        actually, but it's not much." "Everyone little info helps." you said and
        he told you what he found out "So, let's see what comes up." with the
        new info you got to searching "What do you want to do tonight?" Ryan
        asked as you both waited for the results "There was this new series that
        I was planning on starting today but since I'm here, I was going to
        watch it tonight, I guess we could watch it together or do you have
        something in mind?" you asked turning to him "I was going to ask if you
        wanted to go to the movies, because it's been a while since we've went."
        Ryan's suggestion brought a smile to your face but before you had a
        chance to reply, the program dinged signaling the search is finished
        making you both look back towards the screen "We have some hits" you
        said pulling up the list "Okay, we're getting somewhere." you both
        started to look through the list and at that time Ryan got a call from
        Calleigh. "Calleigh wants to see me." you nodded "Okay." "I'll be right
        back." Ryan said tapping your lower back before leaving and you turned
        back to the screen. Just as Ryan stepped out the door, the sirens in the
        building went off with red flashing lights and the doors to your room
        secured shut. Panic immediately settled in between the two of you. Ryan
        turned back to your room and started pulling on the door and you were
        super confused not sure what was happening. You moved over to the door
        to ask Ryan what was happening but remembered these rooms are sound
        proof so you pulled out your phone and called him "Ryan, what's
        happening?" you asked looking into his eyes and saw there was panic
        within them "I'm sure it's nothing." Ryan said and you knew he was
        clearly lying to you "Please don't lie to me right now Ryan." he sighed
        before replying "If deadly toxins are released these rooms are designed
        to keep them in." panic immediately over took you and Ryan saw it so he
        was quick to calm you "Babe, I'm sure you're fine. This is a computer
        lab, one of the other labs probably were opposed, so I'll just go and
        see what's going on and you can continue work, to take your mind off
        it." Ryan said trying his best to offer you a smile so you nodded
        "Okay." you said but then a thought crossed your mind and your eyes
        widened "What is it?" "Hold on, I have a hunch." you said quickly going
        back to your computer putting the phone on speaker. The list that was
        rendered that you and Ryan were going through, you decided to check
        something "Talk to me babe, what are you thinking?" "I'm thinking, what
        if we are one of the targets." you said giving him a quick worried look
        before searching the list. "So?" Ryan asked waiting for your reply so
        you turned slowly to him and the look on your face answered his question
        and his heart sunk. "Maybe you're still in the clear." Ryan said as you
        came back over to him "I'm going to go and find out what's going on,
        okay? So please just stay calm and I'll be right back." you nodded and
        you both touched through the glass before he hung up and left.
      </p>

      <p class="story">
        He made his way to Calleigh and saw she was in the same predicament as
        you. "What's going on?" Ryan asked her as they faced each other through
        the glass and talked on the phone. "H called and said the whole lab is
        on lockdown, while they find out what was released or if anything was
        released into the rooms." Just that moment Calleigh said she was getting
        another call so Ryan hold on. "That was H, the toxin has been released
        here, but only one room was targeted." Calleigh said but the look she
        was giving him left him unsettled "Calleigh, please don't say what I
        think you're going to say." Ryan shook his head and she gave him a
        worried look "Heather is in there?" and Ryan's heart dropped cause her
        question confirmed his suspicion and he nodded "Oh no. Okay, it's going
        to be okay, the others are looking for the people responsible and
        they'll find the vaccine." Calleigh tried to reassure Ryan but it's like
        he stopped functioning for a moment "Ryan, Heather is going to be okay.
        We're all working on it." Ryan slowly nodded "I gotta go see how she's
        doing." Ryan said offering Calleigh a smile before heading back to you
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="story">
        While Ryan went to find out what was going on, so you decided to busy
        your mind and continuing your search for the official locations the
        toxin will be released because even if it maybe here, you might be able
        to stop the future attacks. H gave you a call and shared the news with
        you but told you not to panic or worry cause they're going to make sure
        you leave that room alive and in the mean time you managed to be
        successful with the locations that were targeted with the remaining
        information you received from Horatio and in fact the station was
        targeted. Your worst fear came to fruition. After that was done, you
        just had to wait now and see how it played out. You were hunched over
        the surface computer now lost in thought when you heard a knock at the
        glass door, so whipping your head around you saw it was Ryan and he had
        a ghost of a smile on his face. Picking up your phone, you headed to the
        door "Hey you." you were the first to speak, hoping to settle Ryan's
        heart cause you know it's hurting him knowing that you're stuck in there
        with a deadly toxin. "Hey, you heard?" you nodded when Ryan asked that
        "Yeah, and I've managed to find the targeted locations." you told him
        and his heart should have been lighter at hearing that but it wasn't
        because you were trapped and exposed. "How are you feeling?" Ryan asked
        looking at you with worried eyes "Honestly, tired. I think we should get
        chairs in here." you joked hoping to lighten the situation and that made
        Ryan release a small smile "I'll make sure to get you one in the
        future." he told you, and there was a little quietness before you spoke
        "How are you doing?" you asked Ryan and you saw him release a sigh
        "Scared and worried, I hate seeing you trapped in there, knowing the end
        result of the toxin." you knew he would be so you gestured to him "I'm
        going to sit on the ground, join me." you took off your heels and sat
        crossed legs, and Ryan copied your actions, minus the shoes part and
        joined you. "Everything is going to be okay. The CSI team is amazing at
        their job." you said hoping to settle Ryan's heart "They are and I wish
        I was there helping them." Ryan said lowering his head "As much as I
        love you doing your job, I'm thankful that you're here with me." you
        said giving him a wide smile and placed your hand on the glass "Would
        have been even better if I stayed in the room just a second longer." you
        shook your head "No, I wouldn't want you in here." Ryan's eyes soften at
        that before he protest "I would take your place even if I could, because
        I don't want you to suffer." just as you were about to say something the
        computer beeped, "Hold on." you said and got up but the moment you
        reached your feet, your head became uneasy and the world started to
        spin, you managed to reach the desk in time to ground yourself "Heather,
        what's wrong?" Ryan asked as panic started to settle in again seeing you
        being unsteady "My head, I think my body is starting to sho-" before you
        could finish your sentence, you fell going unconscious and Ryan
        immediately stood up banging the glass door shouting your name
        "Heather!" he kept calling your name nonstop, telling you to wake up.
        You were out for full three minutes before you heard a distant pounding
        as your head was fuzzy, so you slowly moved and opened your eyes in a
        squint "Heather, baby, wake up. Look at me." hearing your voice being
        called, you looked towards the sound and saw Ryan banging on the glass.
        Catching yourself, you raised your hand in a thumbs up position to let
        him know you're okay. Giving yourself a minute, you slowly started to
        move going over to the door, to be close to Ryan again. "Hey beautiful.
        Don't scare me like that." Ryan said as you approached him and leaned
        yourself against the glass door, leaning your head on the cool glass.
        "My head just gave way, but I'm feeling better now." you told him
        offering a tired smile and Ryan's heart just clenched seeing you like
        this. You started fanning yourself "It's getting hot in here." you said
        starting to unbutton the few buttons of your top to help relieve the
        heat "They cut of the air conditioner to that room. I'm sorry." so you
        waved your hand "It's okay." Ryan just wished he could hold you and
        offer you comfort. "Let's keep talking, you have to stay awake." you
        nodded keeping your eyes open as your breathing became heavier "What
        movie are we going to watch this evening?" you asked Ryan trying to help
        with the situation "I don't think we'll be making the movies this
        evening babe." you gave him a hard look "So negative Ryan, just humor
        me, please. Let's imagine I'm not about to die and it's a normal work
        day." the moment those words left your mouth, his head snapped towards
        you "Don't ever say that Heather, you're not going to die." you smiled
        towards him "Okay, then, let's pretend it's a regular day. What movie
        are we going to watch?" you asked softly trying to keep yourself steady
        "I know you love Tom Cruise, and the new Mission Impossible recently
        came out, so I said I was going to surprise you with that." a smile
        immediately appeared on your lips "I do love Tom Cruise. That truly
        sounds perfect." you said tiredly smiling towards his direction and Ryan
        returned it but his heart was pained cause he could see you were
        fighting to stay awake. "I think you love Tom Cruise more than me at
        this point." Ryan joked and you chuckled which resulted in you coughing.
        You brought your hand to your mouth to capture the cough and Ryan's full
        attention was on you. When you moved your hand away, you saw there was
        blood and Ryan saw it as well so you both shared a look and gave him a
        smile "I'm fine babe." Ryan sighed cause he knew you weren't fine. Your
        chest was starting to hurt, with the pain your body was starting to
        feel, tears slowly started to prick your eyes, so you turned away so
        Ryan wouldn't see you. "Heather, what's wrong?" the moment Ryan asked
        that he heard a sob release from you and his heart broke "I'm fine." you
        said trying your best to hide the state you were in "Look at me
        beautiful." you heard the pain in Ryan's voice so you slowly looked
        towards him and the sight of you broke him. "I don't want you to see me
        like this." you said and Ryan shook his head "No, I'm here with you, I'm
        not leaving you." so you smiled after coughing some more "Thank you."
        the tears started to flow now along with the fear "I don't want to die
        in here Ryan." you said both hands on the glass now and Ryan hated this
        every bit "You're not baby. We're going to get you out." "Just in case I
        don't" you started and Ryan shook his head "No, don't go there." "Just
        listen to me, please. I love you Ryan, I love you so so muc-" you
        erupted into another coughing fit that resulted in you having trouble
        breathing "Breathe baby, hang in there." As those words left his mouth
        guys in hazmat suits showed up and that was the last thing you saw
        before you passed out.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="story">
        Ryan was removed so the guys could enter the room and treat you. He
        didn't want to leave your side but for safety reasons you had to be
        separated and his mind was spinning hoping you were okay. Not once was
        Ryan's mind settled until he heard that you were cleared and he could go
        to you.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="story">
        You were in the hospital and Ryan was currently by your side in a chair,
        hand gripping yours, just watching your face as you were hooked up to a
        ventilator to help you breathe. Ryan hate to admit it but he was crying
        cause he thought he lost you and just seeing you like this was hurting
        him. There came a knock at the door making Ryan quickly wipe his eyes
        before turning back to see who it was. "Come in." he said and entered
        Delko, offering Ryan a soft smile "Hey man, how is she?" Delko asked
        entering coming to stand beside Ryan "Still not breathing fully on her
        own." Ryan said trying his best to keep it together "She's going to be
        okay Ryan. We both know she's a fighter." Delko reassured him, resting a
        hand his shoulder. "I know she is, but I want her to wake up now, just
        so I can know that she's definitely going to be okay." Ryan said
        truthfully "I understand. Want to take a break, I'll watch her, cause I
        know you've been sitting there for hours." and sighed "I don't want to
        leave her." Ryan said making Delko chuckle "It's funny because Heather
        and I had a conversation about this." that made Ryan look up at him
        "What do you mean?" "We were talking about the time I was in the
        hospital, and she said if she was in my position, she knew for a fact
        that you wouldn't want to leave her side." Delko said making Ryan
        chuckle "She does know me well." Ryan said looking back at you "But she
        also told me, that just in case something happened that to let you know
        that it's okay if you took breaks cause she knows it can't be
        comfortable sitting there for so long." Ryan chuckled again "Even
        unconscious she's still looking after me." so deciding to obey you, he
        stood up and kissed your forehead before turning to Delko "I'm going to
        go to the bathroom and stretch my legs, watch her for me." Delko nodded
        "Of course." with that Ryan took one more look at you before turning
        back to Delko "Thanks." with that he left the room. Delko took the seat
        Ryan was in and took your hand in his. At this point you became like a
        sister to him and it hurt seeing you like this. "I never expected to be
        here seeing you like this, I know we just joked that day but knowing it
        came through is scary. We almost lost you today Heather, and I'm very
        thankful we didn't. I've come to love you like a sister, so I don't
        think I can handle losing another one." Delko squeezed your hand at
        that, and just thinking about that brought tears to his eyes. "But
        you're still here. Ryan still have his wife. You should of seen him when
        they separated you guys, I think he stopped functioning. He's better now
        but you know he isn't going to be fully better until you wake up." right
        after that came a knock at the door and Calleigh peeped her head in "Can
        I come in?" she asked with a smile, holding back her tears and Eric
        nodded "Of course." "Where's Ryan? I didn’t expect him to leave
        Heather's side." Calleigh said with a smile "Heather's order, she told
        him to take breaks." Calleigh gave a look of confusion so Eric explained
        and they both laughed at that "Definitely sounds like Heather." They
        both remained by your side till Ryan returned and one by one, rest of
        the team visited you having their moments with you.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="story">
        Ryan was currently leaned over, resting his head on the bed, while still
        clutching your hand, when he felt a squeeze of your hand. That made him
        immediately look up to you and saw your eye lids moving "Heather." he
        called out standing up moving closer to you, at the call of your name,
        you slowly opened your eyes adjusting to the light and a huge smile
        appeared on Ryan's face, so wasting no time, he called for Alex as she
        was the one dealing with you. Alexx came, removed the mask, and checked
        you out, to run more test. "You just woke, so please take it easy, okay
        baby?" Alexx ordered towards you so you nodded a little as she raised
        the bed so you would be in a higher position, then she turned to Ryan
        "Watch her." "My eyes won't leave her." Ryan said smiling wide knowing
        that you're finally awake and Alexx shook her head knowing how happy
        Ryan is right now "I will be back in a few." she said before leaving.
        Ryan turned back to you, smile not leaving his face making you chuckle
        "Don't hurt yourself now, from smiling too hard." and Ryan shook his
        head "Never, the sight of you awake just makes me so happy." Ryan said
        bringing your hand up to kiss the back of it. "I'm sorry for worrying
        you baby." you said leaning forward to capture his cheek "No, don't
        apologize for that." Ryan reassured leaning into your hand, looking at
        you with so much love. "Thank you, for staying there with me, I knew it
        wasn't pretty." you said truthfully.
