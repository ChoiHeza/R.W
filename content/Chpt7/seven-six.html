            You were both awake, but Ryan had closed back his eyes to savor the last moments in bed before he had to start his day, so you were currently enjoying this moment by admiring Ryan's features and he was just letting you do your thing. You were tracing along the features of his face before raising your hand up to run your fingers through his hair at the front "This feels nice." Ryan commented making you smile "What does?" you asked combing his hair back with your fingers "You touching me like this, it feels really nice." Ryan stated before opening his eyes meeting yours "Is it relaxing?" you asked him and he nodded with a smile growing on his lips "Very, don't stop." you chuckled "You got it." and you continued as long as you could before it was time for you guys to get up "It's time Ryan." you said causing Ryan to groan and shake his head making you laugh at his behaviour "Well, you can remain here but I'm going to get up because I have some extra things to do today." you said with a sigh getting up, leaving Ryan in bed "I'll go put the kettle on." you told him before heading to the kitchen and putting it on to boil before returning to the bedroom, to find Ryan was still in bed but sitting up now, feet on the ground "Look who's finally awake." you commented heading over to the dresser but Ryan halted you "Come here." he said, so you changed direction heading his way "Yes?" you said as you approached him and the moment you were in front him, he took hold of your waist, wrapping his arms you in a hug, placing his head on your torso. "You okay babe?" you asked rubbing his back "Yeah, just think we're due for a vacation, and we didn't get to do anything special for our anniversary this year." Ryan said looking up at you making you look down at him "We went to dinner." you told him "Yeah, but that was it, nothing special." Ryan stated "But I thought the dinner was very special, and I had an amazing time." you told him truthfully but Ryan gave you a sad smile "But I wanted to do more for you." you got all soft inside so you decided to staddle Ryan's lap just to be closer face to face "Ryan, that was enough. The fact that I got to spend it with you, that's all that matters and it didn't matter what we did. Plus around that time was crazy, with Jessi's death, work being more busy, we recently moving and getting settled in the new house." you listed off as Ryan listened "But we're still together for another year, and that's what is important." you told him truthfully and Ryan just couldn't help but smile at the words you said because you're right, once you guys are together that's all that matters "You're right, this is why I love you." Ryan said before connecting his lips with yours.

            "Small bear, I am in need of your assistance." you heard Walter say as he entered the lab "What is it my love?" you asked turning to him as he came and stood next to you "There's some footage I want to see from the show." Walter said and you nodded "Sure, a particular part?" you asked "Yeah, it's one of the confession cams." he said before telling you which one so pulling up the clip you hit play "I really don't understand how people watch this." you commented making Walter chuckle "I think Ryan secretly watches this show." you looked around and made sure the room was still empty before leaning towards Walter "He does, and I don't think he knows that I know he watches it." you whispered then put your fingers on your lips "Shush, you never heard this from me." you both shared a laugh before turning back to the screen to continue your work.

            "Beautiful, I got the pain killers." Ryan said as he entered the lab, because you're currently having a headache and Ryan said to stay put and he'll get some painkillers for you "Thank you so much babe." you watched as he approached you before handing off the pills and a bottle of water he brought. You took them as Ryan watched you "Think I'll hide them under my tongue?" you joked and Ryan chuckled "Maybe, I know you hate taking pills." you chuckled before drinking more water then showed Ryan under your tongue, so he can see you swallowed them. He laughed "Good girl, I really hope your headache goes away." Ryan said placing a hand to your lower back "I think that vacation is due." you commented and Ryan nodded "Very much, because you rarely suffer from headaches." Ryan said giving you a worried look "With the pills it should go away." "Hopefully. Do you need anything else?" Ryan asked so you decided to tease him "Yeah actually, I have a question." and Ryan nodded for you to continue "Who is your favourite star from the show?" you asked trying to hide your smile and Ryan sighed "Was it Walter?" and you chuckled "Babe, you forgot we actually live together right?" you asked with a raised brow "But I did that in secret" he stated and you shook your head "You thought you did it in secret but you weren't so good at it, but I pretended to knew nothing." you said with a point of your finger and Ryan shook his head at you with a smile "Thank you for that I guess, cause I know you don't understand how people enjoy it." you nodded "I really don't, but… I won't judge you for it or make you feel bad for liking it." you told him truthfully and Ryan's heart softened at that "Thank you beautiful." you give him a grin and at that point his phone rang, it was H, so that's when he took his leave after giving your temple a kiss.

            "You know what's something I've neglected to do today?" you asked turning towards Ryan as you closed your locker "Appreciated how handsome you looked today, wearing one of my favourite looks" you said with a wink and Ryan grinned "So what was that this morning, where the moment I was finished dressed you had your hands all over me?" he asked with a raised brow "Well, that was this morning, not during the day." you stated and Ryan chuckled "Well, we only met once today, and that's only because I brought pills for you." he commented and you realized he was right "But, we still have the evening ahead of us, and I may be extremely tired but. . ." you said looking around before going closer towards Ryan, resting a hand on his torso "with how gorgeous you look, I just might have enough energy for something something." you said with a smirk "And you know, if you're too tired, I could always do all the work." Ryan said looking down at you, coming closer himself "I am going to pretend I did not just hear those words left your mouth." came Walter's voice as he entered the lab catching Ryan on what he just told you, so you just chuckled "So I now see what the psychic meant." followed Eric's voice and that made Ryan quickly look towards him, giving him a look as to not say another word "What do you mean?" you asked curious and Eric laughed "Come on man, let me tell her." Eric pleaded and you were just in suspense "Well I want to know too." Walter joined and you nodded so Ryan sighed "I can tell her myself." and Walter sulked at that "Not cool guys." he said with a shake of his "Don't worry, I'll tell you." Eric whispered towards Walter "I heard that." Ryan said with a smile.

            "I love this back." Ryan said as he was on his side, placing kisses on your back "Two is enough Ryan, I'm tired." you stated as your eyes remained close "I'm not doing anything." Ryan defended going back to his side, but leaning up on his elbow looking down at you, admiring your beauty "Uh huh." you said before opening your eyes "You have the look." you said pointing at his face "What look?" Ryan asked faking innocence "The 'let's go another round' look." you told him, going to your side now, copying his position "I didn't know I could do that look." you nodded "Yes, and that's why majority of the times, we go more than one rounds." "Interesting. Well you could always say that I tired you out." Ryan teased with a raised brow, so you decided to one up him "Or, you could tell me what Eric was talking about or I could ask him myself." you countered back with a raised brow of your own. So defeated, Ryan sighed before falling to the bed on his back, arm going over to cover his eyes. "So…" you probed moving closer, resting your hand on his bare chest, playing with the hair there "When we went to see the psychic, she like did a reading on me, and I may or may not got caught up in what she was saying, wanting to know more." Ryan started while removing his arm from his face "Like what exactly, your aura was off or something?" you asked curious "Something like that, but she mentioned about me doubting being a good husband -" you cut him off "We had that conversation that morning." you asked amazed and Ryan nodded "What else did she say, now I'm really interested?" you asked with a chuckle "She talked about your aura having colours, or something like that, so the doubt was the blue and she probably guessed that my doubt probably pertained to our sex life but she said, the colour for that, red, was nowhere in sight." Ryan said looking towards you now but you scrunched up your brows in confusion "Does that mean our sex life is bad?" Ryan chuckled and shook his head "Quit the opposite exactly, I think her exact words were 'your sex life is at the best it can be and can only get better'" you raised your brow at that "Ah really?" you grin and Ryan chuckled with a nod "Which is weird because we don't believe in those kind of things, but in my opinion she was spot on. She first captured me with the doubt reading, cause that's exactly what I was feeling and the sex part I choose to believe because why not." Ryan said making me laugh "Only a real pervert would say something like that." you said going to sit up now "But come on babe, honestly don't you think that our sex life is amazing?" Ryan asked sitting up as well "I'm not denying it, I'm just teasing you." you said with a wink, and then a peck to his lips before getting up from the bed. Ryan just watched your every movement as you picked up his blue button up that he wore today before putting it on your body "What do you feel like eating?" you asked turning back to Ryan as you buttoned up the shirt, but he was just so caught up in admiring you and reading his expressions you shook your head "No Ryan, I'm talking about actual food." you said with a raised brow and hand on hips "Fine, but aren't you tired, I could cook." Ryan suggested, he has learnt some things from you over the years and he can do more than mac and cheese "And I can just sit there and look pretty?" you asked and Ryan grinned with a nod "Yes, let me serve you, I don't want that headache coming back." Ryan said coming over to you after putting on a pair of sweats "Aren't you a doll." you commented looking up at him as he captured your waist "I'm your husband, and it's my job to take care of you." you smiled widely at that before giving him a kiss "And you had doubts." you said leaning back and Ryan chuckled "I know better now." then he removed his hands before interlacing his fingers with yours "Shall we go eat?" he asked and you nodded "We shall." you giggled before Ryan tugged you along out the bedroom towards the kitchen.
