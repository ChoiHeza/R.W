            "I heard about the case today, the man that was being targeted." you said making Ryan look to you as you both were on sofa, you reading while Ryan was watching tv. "Yeah?" Ryan asked and you nodded "How was it, brought back any old memories?" you asked hesitantly and Ryan chuckled "It did actually and also reminded me of what happened between us." marking your book before closing it to give Ryan your attention "You know, you don't have to talk about it if you don't want to." you told him "I know, but that's the past and I've healed from that, so I donâ€™t mind talking about it because it was actually helpful today." you raised a brow at that "Ah really?" Ryan nodded "When we visited the target's hideout, we found out his secrets, and I hate to say it but I knew it all too well." you tilted your head to the side "Were you alone?" you asked and he shook his head "I was with Walter and he was surprised to know that I knew so much about it but I think he caught on that it was from my past or at least an old habit of mine." you nodded at that "Do you miss it?" you asked curious and Ryan chuckled "You, in the first stages of when I stopped gambling, I did miss it, I really did, because it became a part of me that I couldn't live without but after everything that happened between us I honestly hate the habit and don't miss it at all, not once have I even willingly thought about it." Ryan said truthfully and that brought a smile to your face "You know I'm proud of you, because I heard that can be a hard habit to break away from." you said so Ryan reached forward for your hand to pull you closers towards him "Well, I had the support I needed and I have something in my life that is way better than gambling, I just wished I realized it sooner." that made you all shy causing Ryan to laugh at you "I mean it, I love you too much to ruin what we have now." "And I love you and I'm thankful that you picked me, over gambling." you said with a chuckle so Ryan captured your face between his hands and placed a kiss on your lips "I would pick you any day over anything." he said making you give him a kiss of your own.
