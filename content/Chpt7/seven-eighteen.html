            Being deep in sleep you were woken up by Ryan placing kisses all over your body. It's one of his favourite ways to wake you up, and it being the day off for both of you and his first off day in two weeks he was looking forward to having you to himself for the whole day and he's not going to waste any of it. Peaking your eyes open you checked the clock on the bedside table to read the time, 7:24 A.M.. You closed back your eyes so they can wake up fully but that didn’t stop Ryan from his assault. He moved from your stomach coming higher to pepper kisses in your neck and he did it in a tickling way causing you to giggle letting him know that you're awake, he leaned up and looked at you but your eyes were still closed "Good morning gorgeous." he said kissing your cheek causing you to hum "Good morning." you finally opened your eyes and met a very wide awake Ryan ready to start his day with you but you were still super tired from last night, and not because of the reason you think, work finished way later than usual. His awake look made you groan and you closed back your eyes throwing your arm over your face to cover them, and Ryan just chuckled at your action "It's okay babe, take your time, I have all day. I can just keep giving you loving till then." he started back with his assault of kisses on your body, starting from your neck making his way down, then back up and it was killing you with his teasing. When he reached back up to your neck he removed your arm from your face and continued his kisses there. He kissed everywhere leaving your lips last cause he know that's where you wanted it most, so when he finally placed his lips on yours you caved and he took initiative to deepen the kiss. Wanting to take hold of the situation you flipped Ryan over to straddle his hips and he looked up at you with a smug look, he was so enjoying this. You connected back your lips to continue the deep kiss holding his face in your hands while his hands ran up and down your thighs. Leaving his mouth it was now your turn to assault his body with kisses, starting with his face then you made your way down, when you reached his stomach his phone started to ring, groaning loudly Ryan reached for it, in case it was work, but you don't stop what you're doing. Looking at the caller id he swore under his breath before answering "This is Wolfe" he said into the phone while you continued your assault down his body. It was a little while before he spoke again "Okay, I'll be there." he hang up and sighed heavily making you stop what you were doing to sit up and look at him, the look on his face told you it all "Work?" you asked and he just nodded his head with a sigh, this was so not how his day was supposed to go. You leaned down once more and placed a deep kiss on his lips which you know he wants to take further but you have to stop him. "Come on, get up." you said getting up off of him a bit disappointed and sad but you understood the current state of things. After you got up, Ryan sat up starting to contemplate life "Go shower and I'll get your clothes for you." you leaned down and kissed his forehead before making your way to the closet to get clothes for him. He watched you walk over to the closet wearing only a pair of knickers and one of his t-shirts which you took from the chair nearby. It hurts him to leave you like this knowing you both were supposed to be together all day, and you just look absolutely stunning before him. With a heavy heart and a sigh, Ryan got up and made his way to the bathroom for a quick very cold shower.

            After you finished picking out his clothes, a blue t-shirt and a pair of dark jeans, you left the bedroom and made way to the kitchen to make coffee for him, placing it in his cup. By the time you were finished pouring Ryan entered the kitchen, dressed in the clothes you left for him along with his gun and badge looking official and his bag in hand ready to go. "Coffee's finished." you gestured holding the cup. He smiled and you both made your way to the front door. You took his bag from him so he could put on his shoes, and before taking them from you, he grabbed your hips pulling you towards him, then wrapping his arms around your waist "Can't I just ditch, forget that they're convicts running around and stay home with you?" he asked with a skulk so you shook your head with a giggle "No, they need you. Hurry and catch them so you can return home to me." you said with a nod which he returned, releasing you from his grasp he took the bag from you placing it on his shoulder and the mug from your hand. With his free right hand he placed it on the side of your neck pulling you into him for a kiss. With this kiss you know he really didn't want to leave you, but you can't encourage him or he won't leave. So you pulled away causing him to groan "Go Ryan. The quicker you leave, the quicker you return." "You're right. I'm going I'm going." he said opening the door to leave but not before giving you one more quick kiss making you smile. You told him bye and closed the door locking it behind him.

            Ryan arrived on the scene and approached Delko first "What's up, I thought you had the day off?" Delko asked after he hung up his phone "Yeah, so did I but when Natalia's on public relations duty, H thought and extra set of eyes might help out. I didn't bring my kit, mind if I borrow some gloves?" Ryan asked and Delko nodded "Sure, and Heather, is she out too?" "Nah, lucky her, she still gets to me home." Ryan stated making Delko chuckle before they got to work.

            After Ryan has been calling Natalia none stop and finding it odd that she was not answering, he decided to follow up on it. With Frank going to investigate they realized that she was taken "Let's call Mrs. Wolfe please, right away." H said out loud after finding out the magnitude of the situation. "On it." Ryan said pulling out his phone.

            You were reading when you got called by Ryan to come in so you wasted no time when you found out Natalia was kidnapped. Heading to the station first to grab a few things before an officer brought you to the college that you were needed at. "Hey babe." Ryan greeted as he waited outside for you "Hey, so update me." you stated and Ryan told you of the current situation "So you guys want me to check the crowd?" you asked as Ryan lead you to a podium "Yeah, I really hope it's not Patrick." Ryan said with a sigh "We'll find her." you reassured before you started to set it "Just give me a bit and I should be ready." you told him and he nodded.

            As the program was running, you pulled up several photos from the audience that Natalia were speaking to "So I've uploaded all the security footage from when Natalia was here." you told Ryan as he looked on "Alright, so what are we looking at?" Ryan asked trying to understand "There's a software I've been designing that allows me to analyze behaviour by reading facial expressions and body languages." you started and Ryan looked at you impressed "Really, you?" he asked and you nodded "Your wife is pretty smart you know." you said with a wink before turning back to the screen "This thing would read thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of facial cues, breathing patterns, body language indicators, everything." you explained before demonstrating "Here, take this girl for example, the matrix data identify her as mildly deceptive." you said selecting a random girl from the crowd before picking several other more to show their different emotions "If we make our way around." you said as the screen calculates and collects the body languages of each individual "Wait, hold on." you said as it pauses on someone not detecting anything from them "Red flag." you commented "What is it? A deceptive expression?" Ryan asked you "No expression at all." you said before pulling up the individual closer on screen "Looks like he's trying to hide himself from us." you stated "Okay, can we get a better look at this guy?" Ryan asked looking closer "No, but we may not need to." you replied coming up with an idea "Let me try facial recog search." you said starting it "There." you matched both the images together and we got a lead "It's Clarkson." Ryan stated as he saw the face "Clarkson has her." Ryan said looking towards you and panic settled in "Then you guys better find her." you told him and he nodded "Thanks babe, we'll get her." he said before leaving your side and you looked back at the screen hoping Natalia will be okay.

            It was the end of your shift and Ryan just called and told you to meet him downstairs in the interrogation area but H also called you to meet him as well, so you were wondering as to what this maybe about. As you were heading down you saw a familiar person ahead of you "Molly?" you called out and she turned around "Hey." she halted waiting till you catch up "Heading towards the interrogation room?" you asked and she nodded so you guys decided to walk together "I don’t think I've never properly introduced myself, my name is Heather, computer tech." you said with a hand out which she took "I'm Molly, just a regular lab tech, how long have you been working here." she asked and you thought for a moment before replying "Almost six years now, not that long." she smiled at that "That's quite some time to me, well compared to me being new here." she stated and she asked you more questions as you guys walked together "Well this is my stop." she said pointing to the room that Ryan and H were in and you widened your eyes "What a coincidence, mine too." you said and you both chuckled at that "Ryan or Horatio?" she asked you gesturing to the room "Both actually, they called just as my shift ended, and told me to come here, what about you?" you asked turning to her "I'm here to speak with Ryan actually." you honestly didn't think too much about it "He hasn't been giving you too much trouble right, cause he has a reputation of being mean or hard on newbies?" you asked cause Ryan has a bad habit of doing that "No, no actually, he has been nice, smug at times but nice." she replied making you chuckled, there it was "There it is, the smug part, he is that, but don't let him get to you." you told her and she chuckled "I won't, I promise." as Molly looked you over she spotted your wedding bands "Married?" she asked and you nodded "Yeah, to the smug guy right there." you replied pointing your head Ryan's direction and just then he and H spotted you guys outside, so Ryan told H something before he left exiting the room "Hey guys." he greeted you both with a smile which you both returned "You can go first Heather." Molly told you kindly "Why thank you." you said sending a smile her way "You and H called, what's up?" you asked as Molly looked on "Well, I was originally going to tell you to go home without me because I'm working late, because H just initiated a man hunt but he called you down to join it." Ryan said making you chuckle "So much for our off day huh." you commented then Horatio called for you "Mrs. Wolfe." he said with a gesture of his hand "Coming Lt." you called to him before looking at Ryan "I am summoned, let me know if you'll want me to pick up dinner." you told Ryan giving his chest a tap "Okay babe." he replied then you turned to Molly "It was nice officially meeting you Molly, we gotta hang out some time." you told her and she nodded with a smile "Same here." with that you left the two. Ryan turned to Molly now "You wanted to see me?" he asked offering her a smile but she was still a bit confused "Did Horatio just say Mrs. Wolfe?" Molly asked confused and Ryan slowly nodded "Yeah… that's her name." Ryan said confused as well "What are you getting at?" Ryan asked trying to understand "You guys are together?" she asked again and Ryan nodded "Married actually, why?" Ryan asked with a tilt of his head "I just didn't know you were married, never saw a ring." she stated "Ah, I only wear it when I'm not working, don't want suspects knowing about my personal life, but I do keep it here." Ryan said pulling out a chain showing his wedding band that hung from it, but Molly was still confused "But you were flirting with me, today for example and times before?" she asked and Ryan released a nervous chuckle "About that, apparently this happens more than you'll know, but that's just me being nice or friendly." Ryan stated hoping not to make things awkward and a look of realization crossed her face "I'm so sorry I misunderstood you." Molly apologized and Ryan dismissed her with a wave of his hand "It's okay, I'm the one that should be apologizing." Ryan said and just then you exited the room "You guys still here, everything okay?" you asked as you came to stand next to Ryan "Yeah, all is good, I was just wanted to ask Ryan something before I left for work." Molly said and you nodded "Okay, well I gotta go and I'll see you guys tomorrow." Molly said looking between you two and you all said your byes, so when she left you and Ryan turned towards each other "What was that about?" you asked and Ryan chuckled "She thought I was flirting with her and I assumed she came down here to ask me out." "Damn Ryan, you gotta stop misleading these women." you said with a chuckle "Then I gotta stop being nice." he joked "Nah, just be you. Anyways I gotta head back to my lab and get started, and H said to bring you along as we start the search." you said making Ryan grinned "Maybe working overtime won't be so bad." he said making you chuckled and as you guys started to move off, H called for both "Mr. and Mrs. Wolfe, don't forget, we leave no stone unturned." you both nodded at that "Yes sir." you both said simultaneously before turning to leave.

            "What a day that was." you said releasing a sigh as you both crashed on the couch after getting home "I think it was an amazing off day we had, we got so much relaxing done." Ryan joked leaning back turning towards you making you chuckle "I know right." you replied following his actions "After these guys are caught let's request a week vacation." Ryan suggested and that made you smile "I am on board with that, let's book a hotel somewhere far along the coastline for that whole week." Ryan was smiling now at the idea "We'll make sure it's one with a balcony." you grinned with a wiggle of your eyebrows making Ryan laugh "As perfect as that sounds, I have something better in mind." Ryan said making you sit up and turning your body towards him bringing your feet to rest under you "I'm listening." you said so Ryan leaned up and turned as well "How about we travel to Barbados?" he asked and your eyes widened "Really?" you asked excitedly and Ryan nodded with a grin "Yeah, and let's really get away so that if any one calls us, we're nowhere near." you were loving the words that Ryan were speaking "Now that sounds perfect, and we'll book a nice room that overlooks the sea, and I could show you around the island and threat you to some of our cuisine, I could give you the whole Bajan experience." you said grinning now just imaging it all and Ryan's features matched yours "I would love that, but what I'm mostly looking forward to is you." Ryan commented making you look at him with a questioned look "What do you mean?" you asked and Ryan leaned forward pulling you closer towards him so you were in his lap now "I want to experience Bajan you, in your natural element, the real you." Ryan stated caressing your hands with his thumbs "You're seeing the real me." you told him but Ryan shook his head "I'm seeing you in America and I know that's not going to be the same as seeing you in Barbados. The bajan gal that you truly are." Ryan said causing you to laugh at the end "And you sure you could handle this bajan gal in her natural element?" you asked with a raised brow while bringing your hands up to wrap around his neck "I would like to think I can but if not, I'm willing to learn." Ryan said gripping your hips making your smile wide "I love you, you know that." you stated "I do know, and I love you and I'm ready to love the real real you." Ryan said truthfully making you cave for him, bringing your lips to his in a sweet kiss, letting him know how much you really love him.
