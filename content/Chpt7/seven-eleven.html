            "What time should I make the reservations for tonight?" Ryan asked as you both were eating breakfast "For eight, to be on the safe side, just in case work carries over." you replied before eating a spoonful of cereal and Ryan nodded "Got it." "So where are we going?" you asked and Ryan chuckled "A surprise, just dress fancy and sexy." it was your turn to chuckle now "How fancy we talking?" Ryan thought for a moment "Like that place we went to last time." you nodded "Okay, I think I might have a dress in mind." you commented and Ryan raised a brow at that "The black one?" you raised a finger shaking it "It's a surprise." you answered with a wink "Fair play." Ryan said before you guys continue eating your breakfast.

            "Did you hear Walter and Ryan got soaked with a purple fire hydrant, boy does it suck to be them." Dave said as he entered back the lab "What's special about a purple fire hydrant, it's sounds pretty." you commented making Dave chuckle "They are pretty to look at but the water that comes from it leaves you smelling awful." you scrunched up your face at that "Never knew about that. I assumed they went and showered?" you asked and Dave nodded "They won't have much of a choice if they're planning on continuing work." you chuckled now "Poor them indeed, but why did they had to be under the downpour, what happened?" you asked and Dave explained the scene from this morning "So basically most of the evidence got washed away, yikes." "Yeah but, you know that's never stopped them from catching the killer." you nodded at that in agreement "That is true."

            After Ryan was showered and changed in the men locker room, he went straight to you for a whiff test "Hey babe." Ryan said entering making you look up and towards him you raised a hand to halt him "Not any closer, have you showered?" you asked and Ryan chuckled with a nod of his head "That's why I'm here. I came for a whiff test before I return to working the case." you nodded and waved your hand forward allowing Ryan to come closer "Let us have it." you joked and Ryan laughed coming closer, so you placed your nose near him and whiffed and he smelled amazing "You smell as good as you look handsome." you commented making Ryan grin "Thank you baby. I just wanted to make sure I was safe to return back to work, don't want anyone thinking I don't shower" you laughed "I highly doubt they would think that but you're safe, so please avoid any more nasty water because I don't want to do you dinner with a bunyak." you said making Ryan laugh "A what?" he asked curious at the funny name "It means bush man, in Guyanese." you commented "And what does bush man mean?" Ryan was so intrigued in these names "Someone that lives in the bush, like in the wild, doesn't shower, smells awful, it’s a Bajan thing." Ryan laughed "I like it, it's funny." you laughed as well "Please return to work and I'll teach you Bajan names later." "You got it." Ryan said and placed a kiss to your temple before leaving.

            "You know what it is catfishing each other." you said as you were pinning up your twists "It's better them doing that to each other than to actual genuine people." Ryan commented as he was getting dressed "I agree, but except that one guy, Justin, he got caught up in it, poor kid." you said and Ryan chuckled "Well no one made him kill the guy." Ryan stated and you nodded "You're right. Okay I think I'm done with my hair." you said making sure it looked good "I still don't know what dress you're wearing." Ryan said making you turn towards him "And you will see it, when it's on my body." you chuckled starting to shoo him out, as he was finished dressed "Now go and wait till you're summoned." you commanded "Yes mam." Ryan said willingly leaving the bedroom so you could get dressed. It was a sparkly white dress that you bought recently, and Ryan is yet to see it, so you were waiting for dinner date to wear it. What can you say, Miami citizens wearing white, has rubbed off on you. Slipping on the dress, it fit you perfect just as the day when you bought it and you're going to wear lap up heels with it cause the sales assistant that helped you with the dress recommended the shoes as well. You would usually get Ryan help you with your shoes but since it's a whole new outfit you want him to see it in its entirety so with heels in hand, you went to the edge of the bed and sat putting them on. Once they felt secure you stood back up and went to the full length mirror and looked over yourself from head to toe, and you must say, you looked quit gorgeous. So satisfied, you headed for the door to show Ryan the look.

            Ryan was currently in the kitchen drinking water as he waited for you "Babe." he heard your voice before he saw you came into view and the moment his eyes landed on you, the water in his mouth got caught in throat stopping his breathing for a moment, but he quickly recovered not raising any alarm to you "You're okay?" you asked making your way over to him and he quickly tried to catch his breath and chuckled "I'm fine, water just went down the wrong way." he said before taking a look at you once again "Whoa, you almost killed me." Ryan said stated "Sorry, I didn’t mean to scare you." you apologized feeling bad but Ryan shook his head "You didn't scare me, it's just how gorgeous you look, it caught me off guard." Ryan said making you shy instantly but confident at the same time if that was possible "Thank you." "Step back and take a spin for me." Ryan instructed so you did as told and Ryan was in complete awe "How?" he asked leaving you confused "How what?" you asked coming back towards him "How are you mine? How did I get so lucky? All the hows." Ryan said making you chuckle, so in front him now, you rested your hands on his clothed chest "Well, I ask myself the same question about you." you said truthfully looking up at him "You look absolutely gorgeous Heather." Ryan said clearly not hearing anything you're saying because he was still stuck on your beauty "You know I'm going to show you off tonight right?" Ryan asked making you chuckle "Don't you always?" you asked with a raised brow "Well yeah, but I'm going to be extra about it." you shook your head at that "Please don't embarrass me." you commented "No promises." he said leaning to kiss your forehead "I just can't get over this look, it's perfect." Ryan complimented once again, placing you at arm's length away from him so he could look over you once more "Thank you, you look pretty handsome too." you said with a wink and Ryan chuckled "Not even close to you." he said twirling you with his hand "So are you ready to go?" you asked stepping away from him and not once did his eyes leave your body "Yeah, just, you know how it goes, I got to watch you walk away first." you laughed at that "Such a pervert you are." you said with a shake of your head but giving Ryan the show he wanted none the less "I need the strength to survive the night." Ryan commented before slowly following after you.
