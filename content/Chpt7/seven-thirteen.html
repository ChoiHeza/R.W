            "Ryan Wolfe, you're making it harder and harder for me each day." you commented as you left the bedroom to see Ryan completely dressed, minus the shoes. "Babe what are you talking about?" he asked as he was putting on his watch giving you a look "You just can't be going around dressed like that." you said gesturing to his whole body and Ryan looked down at his outfit "But I'm just wearing, a white v-neck and dark jeans." Ryan said not understanding and you sighed "That's the point, you just look so good. Like I want to keep you home to myself good." you commented making Ryan chuckle "But I'm dressed so simple." "Yeah, but in my eyes you look anything but simple, you look fine, with an 'o'" you said approaching Ryan now and he laughed "With an 'o'?" he asked with a tilt of his head "Yes, F-I-O-N-E." you spelled out for before pronouncing it "Fione." you said slowly and Ryan laughed "I like that. I should have been using that for you." you shook your head "No no, we're focusing on you so I'm going to apologize in advance for whatever inappropriate behaviour I may exhibit today." Ryan smirked "If I don't apologize for mine, you don't have to apologize for yours. It's nice not being the only perverted one in this relationship for a change." you smacked his chest and Ryan laughed "Ryan!" he shook his head while gripping your hips "I'm not apologizing for that but what I will apologize for is that you got to compliment me before I got to compliment you. You know I love when you wear this white dress. I may be facing the same challenges as you today." Ryan stated running his hands down to your bum. "You know, we still have a little time before we're supposed to leave for work." you said raising on your tiptoes after checking the clock and Ryan raised his brow "So what are you suggesting Mrs. Wolfe?" Ryan asked bringing his face closer to yours "I was thinking, we could maybe.. You know." you said with a shrug "Now you're shy?" Ryan teased with a smile leaning back and you rolled your eyes "Never mind, let's just leave for work." you said stepping out his arms turning away but Ryan captured you back by wrapping his arms around your front, placing your back flushed against him "Nope, not letting you leave because we both clearly have an issue to fix." Ryan said bringing his face in your neck, placing tiny kisses to keep you in place.

            "You are a bad influence on me." Ryan said as you both were in the locker room "But, we aren't late." you said giving him a look "But we almost were." he said with a pointed finger "Fine, next time I'll allow us both to leave the house unsatisfied, but if you look at it you were the one that pulled me back." you stated and Ryan scoffed "That's only because you initiated it to begin with." you guys were having a stare off and at the same time Walter entered "I think this is the first time I've ever seen you guys fight." Walter commented alerted you both of his presence so you both gave him a confused look "What do you mean?" Ryan asked "We aren't fighting." you stated and Ryan nodded in agreement "But you two were back and forth at each other." Walter said pointing a finger between you two and you guys chuckled "Yeah, but not fighting." you stated giving Ryan a wink which he returned with a smirk "I don't think I'll ever understand married couples." Walter said with a shake of his head, giving you guys one last look before turning to his locker, then you and Ryan looked towards each other and shared a smile. "So.. Wife of mine, are we going to behave today?" Ryan asked after he moved closer to you "I'm not going to make any promises." you said truthfully and Ryan grinned then looked towards Walter quickly before looking back to you coming closer "Then neither will I." he said with a wink before leaning down to give you a quick kiss to not get caught.

            With tablet in hand, you headed towards the area Frank was, you call that the detective area. "Heather." Frank called catching your attention making you go towards him because he wasn't at his desk "Can you hold on a minute, I'm trying not to curse out this guy on the phone." Frank commented making you chuckle but you nodded none the less so while waiting you leaned against the desk he was at and looked around and managed to catch Natalia and Ryan interrogating someone in the near distance. Never witnessing Ryan interrogating before, so you looked on completely pulled in by what he was doing, and boy was it a beautiful. So were you currently shamelessly checking out your husband, yes, yes you were. There is just something about it that's hot and so attractive. It the way that he was being intimidating that made it hard for you to look away and thankful for Frank being caught up on the phone the whole time that managed to watch the whole scene unfold in front of you, and just as it ended it's like Ryan sensed you were near looking at him, so he looked your direction catching you gaze making you give him a quick wink because just that moment Frank called you. Ryan didn't miss the look you had on your face so he smirked to himself.

            While Walter was in the morgue with Tom and H he saw the news playing on a tv in the background that leaded him to be onto something regarding the body that was in front of them belonging to the a SA that was just killed. With that idea in mind, he headed your direction and asked you to pulled up the footage from the news snip it he was just watching "Okay, roll it back from the beginning." he told you as you were watching from the part he saw in the morgue, so carrying it back, you both watched intently "What are you hoping to find?" you asked him "Hopefully what happened to the state attorney." he stated so you nodded "Okay go forward." he said and you fast forward until he told you to stop "Okay, wait wait, right there. There it is, stop." Walter quickly said as he spotted the SA in the background "Okay, there's our victim, let's go forward." he said and you took your time, but it was you who spotted it pausing the video "Oh wait, here it is." you said pointing towards the screen "Do you see it, that's right when she got attacked." you stated as you saw the woman being held by a man "Is that an old man?" you asked looking closer "I'm gonna zoom in." you said bringing up the shot bigger "That's our killer?" Walter asked confused "H is convinced it's the Melanoche hit." he said next, so you tried to enhance the image to get a closer look at the attacker "Look at that." you said zooming in the hands after spotting a multiple set of tattoos "Do you see his hands, never seen an old guy with that many tattoos." you commented staring at them but as you were asking questions, Walter rushed out the room leaving you completely puzzled because he figured out who it may be.

            You were currently working on an audio of a tip call, to see if it was altered when Eric entered "Still working on the tipster voices?" Eric asked coming next to you "Yeah." you replied "Alright, let me hear the original call." Eric said but you tilted your head "Well, it's not going to get you anywhere, it wasn't electronically altered, it was only muffled." you stated and then he got into a theory he was thinking about and you saw the direction his mind was going "Okay, to this tipster could lead us to Memmo?" you asked and Eric nodded "Yeah, can you uh, compare the second tipster call against the first one that came in?" Eric asked and you nodded "Of course." and you did just that, so you hit play and you both listened on "Based on the audio waves, that means that they are two callers." you stated looking towards him "So that means that really is a kid." Eric commented sharing your look now and an unsettling feeling fell between the two of you, then Eric got into thinking before coming up with an idea "Wait a minute, we have been at this all wrong." he started to asking you to pull up a list of gang members "Felix is the snitch." Eric said looking towards you "Nice work Eric." you said with a smile which he returned "Couldn't have done it without you." he said before you guys shared a high five and he left.

            Ryan was near your lab so he decided to change direction and head your way, because he's only managed to catch a glimpse of you in the morning after he was interrogating a suspect. Walking outside your lab he looked in through the glass walls and saw you working and managed to catch a quick glimpse of you leaning over the computer before he entered "Hey beautiful." Ryan said causing a wide smile to appear on your face "Hey handsome." you replied back with a wink towards his direction as he came to stand next to you "What brings you by?" you asked not once taking your eyes off of him "Just wanted to see you but now being here and the look you're giving me makes me want to do more." he said so you decided to play along "It sucks that these walls are made of glass." you commented catching Ryan off guard because he was expecting you to scold him not encourage him "You really are tempting me today." he stated making you chuckle "I'm sorry, but it's hard to behave if you're looking this fine." Ryan took a deep breathe while closing his eyes "You're trying to get us fired." he stated making you laugh more "What happened to the self-control?" you asked now resting your hand on his arm. "Slowly leaving my body." he said looking down at you "I guess that was me this morning while I was watching you interrogate that guy." you said making Ryan focus back his attention on you "Yeah?" he asked and you nodded coming closer "I saw the whole thing and just something about watching you turned me on." you said almost a whisper at the end making Ryan groan but he wasn't given the chance to indulge because his cell rang letting him know it was H "This isn't over." he stated you nodded with a wink "Yes sir." "You're going to be the death of me." Ryan said but mostly to himself as he against his will, left you and answered his cell.

            Your shift was finished but as you were about to leave one of the servers decided to crash, making you release a huge sigh. "Yes, please do keep me longer away from my husband." you mumbled sarcastically. While Ryan was in the locker room with the others, he realized that you haven't come down as yet, and knowing the situation of things, you would have been one of the first people there. "Has anyone seen Heather?" Ryan asked the group "Before I came down I saw her still in her lab." Calleigh stated and Natalia nodded "Yeah, I think I heard one of the servers are down." Ryan sighed at that 'So much for getting her home.' Ryan thought to himself before closer his locker and headed back up to you "Thanks guys."

            "F*** me." you said as the server decided to be a pain in the ass but at that exact moment Ryan entered "I would love to but we're still here at work." Ryan commented making you look at him with a chuckle "Very funny. What are you doing here?" you asked and Ryan gave you a look "Well, my wife wasn't in the locker room knowing that a very amazing evening is ahead us so I found it suspicious." Ryan said making you sigh as he stood next to you now "Yeah, sorry about that, but don't forget this job doesn't like us having sex." you chuckled making Ryan nod agreement "I know right and it happens too often. So can I help so we can get out of here quicker and prove this job wrong?" Ryan asked with a raised brow making you grin "Please." you replied before telling Ryan what to do.

            The server took you guys a full hour to fix but you guys got it done none the less, and you left that place, and headed home, stopping for food along the way. "What do you feel like eating?" Ryan asked as you both were in the drive thru looking at the menu display "Something that isn't going to taste bad when it gets cold." you stated and Ryan looked at you with a confused look "What do mean?" he asked and you smiled replying "Well, when we get home we're going to be doing something else besides eating." you said hoping Ryan catches on and he did, of course he did "And you call me the perverted one." Ryan commented with a chuckle reaching his hand across to grip your thigh "That's because you are." you stated as his hand started going higher "And look at what you're doing right now." you said gesturing to his hand and Ryan shrugged before driving forward a bit in the line "I'm just touching your soft legs, nothing more." he stated like it was ever so obvious "Right, and your hand isn't going higher each time." you said gripping his forearm now "Maybe I want to give you a reason to fight for silence while I'm talking to the drive thru attendant." Ryan said with a wink and before you had time to protest, his hand reached his goal as he pulled up to towards the speaker and gave you a look to remain quiet as the attendant asked for the order.
