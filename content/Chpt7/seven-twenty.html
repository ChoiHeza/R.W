            "How dare you look so beautiful and spend the day apart from me?" Ryan questioned as he entered back the bedroom seeing you fully dressed now making you chuckle "Well, that's what happens when you have a very successful wife." you commented turning to him "Do you mind zipping me up?" you asked "Of course." Ryan said coming over to you before continuing "And I am very proud at how successful you are in your career." Ryan said as he slowly pulled up your zip and he placing a kiss on the exposed skin before covering it up "Thank you babe." you said starting to move but Ryan took hold of you "You need to wear more dresses like these to the lab." Ryan commented has his hands captured your hips, pulling you against him "I would but sometimes I have to go into the field and these kind of dresses aren't made for that line of work." you commented as Ryan shaped out your curves with his hands "Yeah, that is a bummer because I would love to see you bent over your computer in one of these." Ryan said going to place kisses in your neck "You know we don't have time for this right, you have to drop me work first." you warned pulling yourself away from Ryan making him groan "Damn responsibilities." Ryan sighed making you chuckle "You'll have me this evening." you told him resting a hand on his chest before leaning up to kiss his lips but he clasped his hands around you hold you there "Why can't I have you now?" he asked lips still against yours "I would of gladly indulged if I didn't have an important meeting with my nemesis and there's no way I'm allowing him to have the upper hand on me." you said bringing your hands up now to capture his face "You know I would." you said with a wink and Ryan chuckled with a nod "I know you would, that's why I love you." he said before giving your lips one more peck then releasing you from his hold "But you're mine this evening." he stated and you nodded "All yours baby." you said with a giggle and wink.

            Ryan was going to pick you back up from work that evening so you were currently outside your building sitting on a bench waiting for Ryan. You only waited ten minutes before you heard his car horn, you looked up and saw it was him. Making your way to the vehicle, Ryan got out coming over to your side to open the door for you "Hello beautiful, hope you weren't waiting long." he said and you placed a quick kiss on Ryan's cheek before getting in the car "No please." he closed the door and jogged back over to the driver side and got in. "You finished quicker than I expected." you told him as he drove off "My wife was waiting for me so I just did the paperwork quicker than usual." he said raising up his free hand for you to take so you laced your fingers with his and he placed a kiss at the back of your hand before resting both hands in your lap "I hope you made no mistakes cause then your wife won't be happy about it" you gave him a stern look. "Yes mam, no mistakes, don't worry." he gave you a reassuring smile. While looking over at Ryan you liked what he was wearing, a blue t-shirt along with khaki pants "You know besides green, blue also looks nice on you." you complimented him and he chuckled "Does that mean I also have to invest in blue clothing as well?" you laughed shaking your head "No no. I was just stating a fact, no need to waste money on anymore clothes." "Okay, I won't. Well just yet." and you just shook your head causing him to laugh at you.

            You both just walked through the front, you first then Ryan followed. The drive home was normal, just light chatter, Ryan feeling up your thighs and comfortable silence. After taking off your shoes, you made way to the bedroom, resting down your bag you went to the bathroom and quickly peed before returning to take off your clothes. Entering back the bedroom you saw that Ryan finally got there. He was currently putting away his things. "What was todays case about?" you asked him while starting to take off your clothes to shower. "Want to play detective and see if you can solve it?" he asked turning to you with a smile, cause it's usually more interesting when you try to solve it yourself then him telling you everything straight forward. "My brain is still active, let's do it." you said entering back the bathroom and stripping the rest of your clothes placing them in the hamper. "Female was found dead, by the side of the pool with her throat slit." he began, you turned on the shower and hopped in. Ryan followed in the bathroom continuing explaining out the details of the case before you while taking off his clothes as well. "This best friend is starting to sound pretty sketchy." you said the wheels in your head turning while you were cleaning your skin. "But remember that she took a polygraph and passed when asked if she killed the victim." Ryan said while joining you in the shower, he continued explaining more and answering your questions while you both showered together "Okay, so, how it's looking, this is my theory so far and tell me if I'm correct or at least on the right track. She has a split personality disorder, and her original side, killed the victim." you said more like questioned towards Ryan causing him to halt washing your back "How did you know that? About the personality disorder?" he asked turning you to face him and he had a look of impressiveness on his face "I analyzed the details you told me about her behavior and the polygraph just proved my theory, and also you mention about her in the beginning writing with her left hand. At first I thought you were just mentioning it because we're left handed also, because it seemed like a random piece of information to just throw in there, and about the cuts she had on her body, they were definitely self-inflicted based on the placement of them, so I just put everything together and came to that conclusion." you explained hoping he would understand and the whole time he just looked so proud of you "That's very impressive babe, she does have a personality disorder, but she isn't the killer. You sure you don’t want to be an official CSI, cause you're really good at this." he said with a wide smile, causing you to match his and you shrugged "I don't want to put you out of a job." you said with a giggle and Ryan just rolled his eyes with a laugh, turning you back around so he could continue washing your back "You may be right about that one. Let me continue." he continued explaining the rest of the case and a light bulb went off in your head "It was the artist guy, he wanted the nice side of the girl, so he could succeed, and if the victim remained by her side, he would of lost her." you said stepping out the shower leaving Ryan to finish washing off and he smiled widely at you "Damn baby, you're good." he replied as you wrapped a towel around your body and got one for Ryan "I have picked up somethings while working at the lab" you said handing the towel to Ryan after he got out turning off the water. "But still, that was really impressive hun." he said wrapping the towel around his waist "I guess you explained it really well, plus most of the time it is always who you never thought it was." you said making your way to the bedroom while drying your skin and Ryan followed. You both got dry and dressed, you wore a tank top along with a pair of shorts while Ryan just wore a pair of grey sweats.

            You both were currently in the kitchen getting something to eat, you were sitting on the counter while Ryan was at the stove. "While on the case today something crossed my mind." Ryan said alerting your attention "What was it?" you asked looking towards him, he paused what he was doing and made his way to you "Remember the part about the keyboard that was coated with poison?" you nodded your head remembering the detail "My mind instantly thought of you." he placed his hands on your thighs while you crook your head to side with a confused look written on your face "What do you mean?" you asked curious and he started running his hands up and down your thighs "You use a keyboard whenever you're at the office, and I thought that this could easily happen to you. What if there was someone that didn’t like you, for example your nemesis, and he wanted to harm you, then poisoning your keyboard would be the perfect way to do it, cause it would be subtle and slow." you saw the worry in his eyes as he said that so you gently placed your hands on his cheeks "I get where you're coming from hun, but remember I'm partially OCD as well. Every time before I start work, I always clean down my desk and everything I use on it, including my keyboard." you reassured him, rubbing your thumbs against his cheeks and he chuckled "You're right, you are bit of a clean freak." and you faked offense placing your hands on his chest to gently push him away "Says the guy that rearranges our cereal boxes." and he immediately put his hands up in defense before returning back to the stove. "But don’t worry babe, I'm always careful where ever I go, so you have nothing to worry about it." "I know you do, but a part of me will always worry." him saying that made you get off the counter and joined him at the stove "Look at me." you said standing next to him and he did "Kiss me."  he leaned down kissing you as commanded and when he pulled away you said "I love you." with a smile on your face to let him see that you're fine "And I love you." he replied back leaning back down once more for a quick kiss.

            After dinner you both were currently on the sofa cuddled together watching tv. You were currently on your back with Ryan on top of you, his head on your chest while you were playing with his hair. A funny scene happened on tv causing Ryan to laugh and you felt him vibrate on top of you. Although you were looking at the tv, your mind wasn't there, you were caught up in your thoughts, just thinking from one thing to another. "This is one of the things that reminds me of you. You guys are so alike" Ryan said but he got no response from you. "Babe." Ryan said trying to get your attention but you were still lost in your thoughts that you didn’t hear him. He lifted his head to look at you and saw that you were looking far beyond the tv, a million miles away, so to get your attention he decided to bury his face between your chest and shake it, and that definitely brought you back to earth making you laugh "What are you doing?" you asked him and he stopped looking back up to you "I was trying to get your attention, where did you go?" he asked a little concern in his voice "Nothing in particular, just replaying events of the day." you said rubbing his back "Babe, are you coding in your head?" that was a habit you had, although you aren't in front a computer, it's like the computer is in your mind and you're writing the code there, thinking of solutions, you shyly smiled and nodded your head "You know me so well." Ryan reached up and tapped your forehead "Turn off the computer up there and let it rest." he said chuckling and you joined "Yes sir, I will." so you stopped your thought process and turned your attention back to the tv "What was it you asked me?" "Monica was doing stress cleaning and I said it reminds me of you and how alike you guys are." he said laying back down and watching the tv "I'm not that bad." "Yes baby, you are that bad. Remember that time, I came home and saw you cleaning out the closet because of a meeting that stressed you out that day." you laughed recalling that memory "and that wasn't even one time, I've come home to you stress cleaning multiple times." he added "You're right, cleaning calms me." you said "Such a Monica thing to say." he said chuckling lifting up his head to look back at you "Oh shush." you said covering his mouth and he licked your hand causing you to pull it away pretending to be disgusted. That made him hold up on his forearms and bring forward his face to yours and he buried it in your neck licking you tickling causing you to laugh out. You protested him to stop but he just continued making you laugh more. When Ryan sensed you had enough and was out of breath he stopped, placing his face right in front of yours "That was not fair, you know how ticklish I am in my neck." you told him catching your breath and he just laughed at you "Well life isn’t fair sweetheart." he said with a smug look causing you to roll your eyes at him, but before you could say something he attached his lips to yours capturing the words you were about to say. You guys shared a sweet kiss before Ryan pulled away "What was that for?" you asked him "Just felt like kissing you." he said nonchalantly laying back down on you to his previous position "You're so weird." you laughed going back to playing with his hair "Weird for you." he said, and you both laughed at that before paying attention back to the tv watching Friends.
