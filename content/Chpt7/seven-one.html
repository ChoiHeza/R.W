            Eric arrived on that floor and found everyone passed out so suddenly panic and fear settled in before he started approaching some of the team, then he remembered Calleigh and quickly headed off in her direction. He picked her up and brought her out from fire arms, but the longer he stayed in there the quicker he started losing his breathe. He managed to make it near the elevator before collapsing, and just that moment H exited the elevator, gun raised assessing the situation before him. He looked down as saw Eric mumbling something to him "Air" Eric was saying over and over, and the moment Horatio caught on he turned towards a nearby window and shot at it breaking the glass. Seconds passed before workers in that area started coming to, everyone was hazy trying to come to their senses. Ryan was near Walter so he crawled over to him, to help wake him up. "Wake up Walter." Ryan called while shaking him and he immediately started wake up, and just as he was about to sit up came Natalia's voice shouting "We need a medic!" she was hovering over Jessie because he was unresponsive and started chest compression and other looked on. H immediately came to her side and saw that Jessie was already gone and it was too late. While Ryan was watching what was going on, you immediately crossed his mind "Oh my god, Heather." he said before quickly taking off in your direction.

            As Ryan was passing outside your lab he looked in and saw you and Dave on the floor "Heather! Dave!" he shouted as he entered going towards you both, Dave was the first to respond but you were still out "Heather, baby." Ryan said immediately going on the ground at your side, lifting your top half up. He was lightly shaking you, while constantly calling your name. You felt fresh air entering your lungs, waking you up, making you take a deep breath and at that moment Ryan released a breath he didnâ€™t know he was holding relieved that you were okay, cause after what just happened with Jessie, he doesn't want the same fate to befall you. "You're okay." Ryan said as you completely opened your eyes before taking you in his arms. Fully coming to, you hugged him back "What happened?" you asked making him pull away "We're not fully sure as yet, but everyone was out." Ryan said before helping you get up "You're okay? Is everyone okay?" you asked inspecting Ryan features and you saw something flashed across his eyes "I'm okay, but one of us didn't make it." Ryan said making your heart drop and Dave looked on wanting to know more "Who?" you both asked at the same time and Ryan took a deep breath before replying cause he knows the moment the name leaves his mouth, he has to prepare for the outcome "Jessie." the moment his name left Ryan's mouth, you felt like you were hit by a truck "What?" you asked not believing what he said "I don't believe you." you said shaking your head fusing to believe what he said but Ryan's face held nothing but the truth. When you finally accepted it your feet gave out under you but luckily still hand you in his hold, so he managed to catch you and arms immediately going around your waist, offering you comfort.

            Recovering from news, you pushed it aside for now and returned back to work because you guys still have to find who's responsible for this. You and Dave were currently working on getting the server back online because a lot of the lab depends on it "Heather, Dave!" shouted Walter heading you guys direction "Hey what's up man, our hands are pretty tied right now" Dave answered for you as you remained focus on what you were doing "Did Jessie ask you guys to process anything this morning, like a memory card?" Walter asked quickly "Yeah." you replied "Where is it?" Walter asked and Dave look away towards the direction of the card "Right over there." he pointed and Walter walked over to it "What's on it?" he asked removing the card from its' case "We haven't gotten a chance to check it yet." you told him turning back to the mess in front of you. Walter tried the card back in the camera but the photos were deleted, so he turned and looked towards you guys "You guys can recover deleted photos right?" he asked watching you both "We could, but the server's down." Dave replied "We can't pull up the recovery software until this thing gets fixed." you added with a sigh and Walter groaned before taking off his gloves "Alright, show me the problem." he told you two ready to help out, and you showed him what to do.

        <p class="story">
            You released a squeal "It's back up." you said excitedly and you guys high fived "Alright, Dave go through the card with Walter and I'll make sure none of our previous progress was lost." you said going to the computer behind them as they went to the front one "You got it." Dave confirmed before getting to work with Walter.

            With the day winding down,  and the man responsible for Jessie's death caught, it was the end of your shift and you released a tired and relieved sigh. Dave was already gone for the day because you had to finalize some things and also you were prolonging the inevitable because earlier you and Ryan agreed to go together to see Jessie one last time because you all heard that he's going back to LA. There came a knock at the glass door making you look towards the sound "Hey you." it was Ryan "Hey." you greeted before turning back to the screen "You ready?" Ryan asked as he stood next to you "I guess as I'll ever be." you said giving him a small smile while he placed a hand on your lower back giving you a comforting smile back. With that you both left and walked down towards the morgue. Ryan looked for which door contained his name, and you stood back and look on preparing yourself to see Jessie. "Here it is." Ryan said standing in front of it then looking back towards you, and you gave him a nod to go ahead. Turning back he unlocked the door pulling it open, before pulling Jessie's body out on the tray. A sob immediately left your lips and you slowly walked over and Ryan placed his arms around you as you both look at him. He looked so peaceful, like he was just sleeping, and he was dressed in his officer uniform. "Even in death he's beautiful." you commented and Ryan tightened his hold on you "I agree." Ryan said making you chuckle "I always knew you found him beautiful." you joked hoping to lighten the mood. Then you reached forward your hand towards him and rested it on his chest "You could of given me a warning that you were leaving me to attend the games with only Walter and we both know he's the loudest out of the three of us." you said smiling down at him but at the same time your heart was breaking "Rest easy dimples until we meet again." you said before bending over to place a kiss to his forehead and the moment you leaned back up, you entered Ryan's arms releasing the tears that you were holding back, so he kept you there, and rubbed your back while offering comfort. Ryan said his byes as well before you guys left and headed to the locker room to meet the rest of the team.

            You all decided to head to the court you knew Jessie and Walter play basketball together, to go and offer Walter comfort because he was going to have a game with him that night. Getting out the car, Ryan intertwined his fingers with yours as you guys walked along side together, heading Walters direction. "Big bear!" you shouted alerting his attention making him look back towards you guys "How did you guys know I was going to be here?" Walter asked as he was in front you all "Where else would you be." H answered holding the ball in hands that rolled towards him "That's right, we're always here for each other." Eric stated and Walter gave you all a grateful smile "I'm on Walter's team because frankly, Calleigh and I bet money on this and I want to throw the game." Ryan said leaving you and going over to Walter's side making you all laugh "Well, I got Natalia." Eric said turning towards her "You got it." she said as they high fived "Against us?" Ryan joked "And since Heather knows the sport, we're gonna referee because I got the whistle." Calleigh said hooking her hand with your as you guys went to the side lines "May the best team win." you said with a chuckle "Now that's not fair, her husband is on the other team." Eric commented and you shook your head "Trust me, that means nothing when it comes to basketball." you added "She's not lying." Walter told Eric "Alright guys, let's play ball." You shouted and Calleigh blew the whistle. You guys played a few rounds with Walter, and you even switched with Natalia joining Eric to take out Ryan and Walter. You guys truly had a fun evening despite the events of the day, and that was all in dedication to Jessie.

            Walking up to the house you spotted a box outside "What's this?" Ryan asked as he approached the front door first, so he bent down and picked up the box, then you remember "I think that might be the shirts I ordered, for Jessie, Walter and I." you said sadness creeping back in and Ryan gave you a look "I'm okay." you reassured and he nodded before opening the door and allowing you to enter first then he entered behind you. You rest down your bag and took off your shoes before taking the box from Ryan and heading towards the kitchen. Ryan was close behind not wanting to leave you alone. Entering the kitchen you pulled out a knife and cut the tape at the top. Resting it down, you started to open the box as Ryan stood on the other side of the counter looking on. Taking the bags out, you counted to make sure it was four of them before opening them one by one "A night we came up with this stupid idea to get matching jerseys to wear when we're watching games." you said with a chuckle and Ryan smiled at the idea. The first you opened was Walters' so you held it up for Ryan to see "I'm guessing that Walter's based on the name." Ryan said with smile as he read the 'BIG BEAR' at the back "So you guys have your nicknames on them?" Ryan asked and you nodded "Yeah, I came up with that idea and they liked it." you explained "So then what would yours be, because they each called you something different?" Ryan asked so before replying you looked for your bag and took out the shirt holding it up for him to see "Short stuff." Ryan read before looking back to you and saw a hint of sadness in your eyes "Yeah, that became a dilemma so Jessie and Walter decided to play rock paper scissors for it, to see which of their nicknames would make it." you said smiling at the memory "And Jessie won." Ryan said completing the story and you nodded with sad smile "He was so happy and kept rubbing it in Walter's face." you said with a chuckle hoping to keep the tears that were threatening at bay "But there's more." you said with a raised brow, looking between the last two bags for a certain one, you smiled as you picked up the right one "Now I'm curious." Ryan questioned and you chuckled opening the bag holding up the jersey keeping the name from his view "Ready?" you asked and Ryan nodded so you turned it to reveal the name and Ryan laughed reading out the name "Short Stuff Husband." he found it pretty amusing and he honestly loved it "I got it just in case you ever decided to come to a game with us." you told him and that warmed his heart, so he reached across for the jersey and you handed it to him "I love it." he said inspecting it himself and that made you smile "I told Walter you would." you said then turned to the last bag, with a sigh and heavy heart, you began to open it "And finally the last one." you said making Ryan look up at you. You took the Jersey out the bag and laid it across the counter, displaying the name 'DIMPLES' leaving a sad smile on your face. "He would of loved it." Ryan said hoping to bring you comfort, but all you could manage to do was give him a nod of your head. Ryan sensed that you were about to cry again so he walked around the counter and wrapped his arm around your waist. You leaned your head on his shoulder with a sob "We were going to wear these tomorrow night at the game." you commented fighting the tears knowing that Jessie wouldn't want you guys being sad about him dying. Ryan not knowing what to say, he turned your body so he could engulf you in a proper hug, rubbing your back up and down. "It's going to get easier." Ryan said and you knew he was right, because eventually you guys will be looking back at the good times you guys had. "But it's okay to be sad now, because I know you and Walter were closest with Jessie than any of us." Ryan sighed before placing a kiss on your forehead. Having enough, you leaned back to look up at him, craning your neck "Life sucks, doesnâ€™t it." you said with a chuckle and Ryan nodded "It surely does, but we still have each other, and that's what matters." you smiled at that and tiptoed to place a kiss on his lips "I love you." you told him as you pulled away "And I love you." Ryan replied smiling down at you, before taking you back in your arms, then his eyes landed on Jessie's jersey "So, what are you going to do with it?" Ryan asked and you assumed he meant Jessie's jersey "I'm not sure, I'll ask Walter tomorrow." you said looking at it yourself then released a sigh "I'm going to miss him." you stated and Ryan nodded "Me too."
