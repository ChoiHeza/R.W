            "Okay, so what is the plan for tonight?" you asked Ryan as you both were eating breakfast "The good old fashioned dinner and a movie." Ryan said making you chuckle "Oo fancy." you emphasized "Sarcasm?" Ryan asked and you shook your head "Of course not, that is fancy, that's like two dates in one." you reassured him "And you sure you're okay with this?" Ryan asked you making looking fully towards him "Of course I am babe. Where's the doubt coming from?" you asked approaching Ryan now and he shrugged "It just feels like I've been neglecting you in terms of dates." Ryan voiced so you titled your head to the side "You haven't, trust me. I don't feel neglected in the slightest. Plus we've been really busy lately, especially with the escaped convicts along with regular work." you told Ryan hoping to make him feel better and to let him know, that you don't feel any less towards him "You're right, we have been really busy.  But if you do feel neglected in any way, please let me know." Ryan said looking down at you and taking hold of your waist "Ryan Wolfe, I don't think that'll ever be possible, I have felt loved by you every single day, even on our bad days, not once have I ever felt any different. I think, well I know we're one of those couples that can say we're happily married." you said truthfully and Ryan grinned at that "Yeah?" Ryan asked and you nodded "You don't think so?" you asked with a raised brow and Ryan released a nervous chuckle "Well, yes but sometimes I feel like I can do better?" he said but more like questioned "In terms of what exactly?" you asked curious "Sometimes I don't feel like I compliment you enough, or remind you constantly how much you mean to me." Ryan stated and your eyes softened at that "Oh, my handsome husband." you said taking hold of his face "What?" "You do enough of those things, and I think more than most people actually would" you told him honestly and Ryan was about to protest "Shush." you said with a kiss to his lips "Ryan, trust me, you're the best husband and you're doing an amazing job. Believe me when I say this please." you told him and Ryan sighed with a nod "I love you." you said smiling up at him and he returned it "And I love you, more than you know." he said before giving you a loving kiss.

            Ryan and Eric visited a psychic that the suspect went to. They confronted her about a plastic fish they found at a crime scene and Ryan made a comment about bringing back the spirit of the dead, to find out who the killer is "I'm more of a healer. I focus on the energies around you. In fact, detective Wolfe, if you don't mind." she started before moving her hands towards Ryan's face "I'm just going to touch you right here." she said placing a thumb on the spot between his eyebrows "Your aura composts of colours." she said before going into explanation and the same time Eric just looked on in amusement "Well, I'm seeing blue, meaning you're having some doubts, you're thinking that you're not good enough for you partner." she said catching Ryan completely off guard but low key Ryan was intrigued to know more "Anything else?" he asked somewhat curious and the woman rubbed the spot some more "With a question like that, knowing your colour, you're probably wondering about your sex life, and I must say detective Wolfe, that the colour for that issue is nowhere near present, I can't even sense it all." the woman said all focus and worried entered Ryan "Is that bad?" now Ryan was really curious "No, that's actually very good, the best even, because one in like every hundred guys I don't see the colour, it's just means that your sex life is at the best it can be and can only get better. From what I'm seeing I don't think the colour has ever been present, very good, your partner must be very happy." she said making Ryan feel a thousand times better and he sent a grin towards Eric who was trying his best to not laugh but his smile didn't last long "I'm also sensing the colour green, financial issues." she stated "Well, yeah, my wife and I recently bought a house and it used up if not most, almost all of our savings." Ryan told her and she nodded before opening her eyes before releasing Ryan "Then I suggest rubbing an essential oil in that spot, it should free up your aura and you should come into some money real soon." she said leaving Ryan completely stunned "A little oil." Eric teased towards Ryan then they got to the real reason why they went there.

            "Well if it isn't my beautiful wife." Ryan chirped as he entered your lab making you chuckle "And if it isn't my amazing husband." you grinned towards him but you spotted a shiny spot on the space between his eyebrows "You have a little something shiny there babe." you said showing him and Ryan reached up to rub it away, he decided to tell you about the psychic visit because it was a little silly, well somewhat. "Thanks." Ryan said next to you now "No problem, so what brings you by?" you asked turning back to your screen and you felt Ryan resting his head on your shoulder "Came for a recharge." Ryan said making you go all soft inside "And he says he doesn't think he's good enough." you commented with a chuckle "I know better now." Ryan said while leaning back up "Good."

            The team were all currently in a room discussing how to find out how the psychic did what she did to suspect "So let's ask her." Natalia stated with a smile "How do you mean?" H asked curious "Well not as a cop, but ask her as a client." Natalia suggested "Like going undercover?" Eric asked her and she nodded "But we have one problem with that though, she's seen all of us, we'll need someone new." Calleigh stated and just that moment you entered the room with tablet in hand "I have the info you guys need." you said and spoke slower at the end as you looked up and saw everyone looking at you with a knowing smile "Uh, why are you guys looking at me like that?" you asked completely confused and Ryan quickly looked around the room to see what you meant then realized crossed his mind "No, she's not doing it." Ryan stated immediately "But, she's the only other person capable and haven't been seen by the psychic." Natalia commented making Ryan sigh but you still stood there super confused "Gonna clue me in, or are we gonna keep talking like I'm not here." you said and Natalia gave Ryan a look before look towards you "We need you to go undercover." the moment that sentence left her mouth a grin appeared on yours "Say less, I'm in." you said super quickly making everyone smile except Ryan "Are you sure Heather?" H asked you and you nodded "Of course, I'll see it as a therapy session somewhat, and talk about when I was kidnapped." you said with a shrug and H nodded "I think that's a good idea." he said towards you before turning towards Natalia "Nice going." he said before walking off.

            "You know I hate this." Ryan said as he placed a wire in your ear disguising it as a hearing aid and a mic on your clothes "What could possibly go wrong, you know I don't believe in this kind of stuff." you told him with a shrug "Everything Heather, everything could go wrong. Why did I agree to be an amazing husband." Ryan said with a sigh "You're going to be near the whole time, listening in, so I'm not worried and if it goes sideways, which it won't, you'll got my back." you told him directly "You damn right, I'm not going to allow anything to happen to you." Ryan said making you smile "My hero." and Ryan shook his head while chuckling at you "Okay, you're ready, just remember, I placed my backup in the middle compartment, just in case." Ryan said and you nodded, so he sighed before reaching up and kissing forehead, leaving his lips there for a while "I still hate this." he stated making you chuckle.

            "So sorry to keep you waiting Mrs. Muir." came the psychics voice as she appeared back in your view. You were currently in an area sitting "That's okay, I'm just glad you're able to see me with your busy schedule." you said playing along offering her a smile while she poured you some tea "Now, I like to record my sessions, for reference only. If you don't mind" she said showing you her tape recorder and at the same time you heard Ryan speak up because he's listening in "That's funny, so do we." Ryan said with a chuckle and his voice coming through threw you off guard, so you reached up to touch your ear "I'm good, I'm good with that." you told her about being recorded "So you said on the phone you were reliving memories of when you were kidnapped?" she asked getting into it so you nodded before explaining what happened, when you were taken by the Russian guy but you lied about Billy being your son. When she reached forward to just give your hand a touch she spotted the device in your ear "You have a hearing aid?" she asked you curious so you nodded "Yeah, I lost majority of my hearing in my right ear when I got hit with the bat, it ruptured a drum." you told her thinking quickly and Ryan was actually impressed with that response "That's pretty impressive babe." Ryan complimented "I can see there's a part of you that's still holding onto that moment, so we need to get rid of it." she said before getting up and retrieving a candle and matches from a shelf before returning to you "I'm just going to realign your aura." she said getting ready to light the candle "So that you'll be able to take control of your life again. Alright." she added then lit the candle "I just need you to lean forward and breathe." she instructed so you did as told "Just breathe, and after this, your kidnapper will never be able to live in your memories again." she said, so you inhaled the contents of the candle "Close your eyes, red will become blue, blue will become yellow, and yellow will become green." she repeated that sequence over and over until you entered a dream like reality state.

            Ryan was currently outside listening on to the mantra, when H pulled up. "How long has she been in there?" H asked the moment he was stood next to Ryan "Twenty minutes, Elena is healing her aura." Ryan told him, not removing his eyes from the monitor showing audio waves and H listened on "What is that?" he asked picking up a weird noise "Some sort of rustling noise." Ryan suggested after hearing it "Is she keying the mic?" H asked so Ryan decided to check in "Babe, hey, give us a sign that you're doing okay, give us a cough or something." Ryan instructed and listened but go no noise from you "I don't like this, get her out of there." H stated and panic entering Ryan, they immediately got into action.

            Approaching the building with guns raised, they slowly entered through the door just hearing the recording "Heather's cover car is gone." Ryan stated after they looked around and his heart was growing uneasy by the second, then they found the recorder along with your hearing device and mic beside them "I didn't even hear the switch over, so we've got ten minutes to catch up to them" Ryan said as he turned off the recording then H entered a state of thinking knowing that your life is on the line "Does she still wear the necklace?" H asked and Ryan nodded immediately feeling stupid for not remember about the tracker he placed in your necklace "I'm on it."

            While they were looking for you, you were in a dream but it felt like reality to you, and you were back in the crack house where the Russian guy took you and Billy, and he was there, but this time you had a gun and wanted to make sure to keep Billy safe so while watching the guy, you were ready to do anything if he did anything wrong. You felt really bad before not being able to protect Billy but this time, you'll do whatever it takes.
        </p>
        <p class="story">
            Ryan and H followed the tracker and it took them to a warehouse, so not wasting any time they got out and advanced, first heading for the car you drove, guns raised. Ryan reached the car to inspect it finding the driver side door open so getting in he checked the middle compartment and cursed under his breath "My backup weapon is missing." he said with a heavy sigh. They both weren't liking the direction this was going so they advanced into the warehouse, being aware while looking for you. "Heather!" Ryan shouted out your name several times but it the dream state it appeared as the Russian man calling you, so you raised your gun aiming at him, keeping Billy behind you "Don't you dare come any closer, you hear me!" you shouted at the man but in reality it was towards Horatio "Heather." H calmly called for you "Stay away from us, I wasn't able to keep Billy safe but this time I'm sure to not fail." you warned still aiming your gun but Horatio kept calling for you, like he was trying to wake you up "Stay away from us!" you shouted constantly but he kept coming closer so you were left with no choice but to shoot. Horatio was quick to dodge the shot, taking cover in the meanwhile Ryan was sneaking up behind you but you heard him so you took shots his direction as well making him hide "I am not letting you have Billy!" you shouted so H decided to risk it and called for you to turn his direction allowing Ryan to tackle you from behind, dropping the gun from your hand. To you it just seemed like the Russian had you holding. While you were fighting with your life and screaming they both kept calling your name trying to wake you up. "Come on baby, wake up, it's us." Ryan pleaded because his heart was hurting seeing you like this scared and helpless, but before you had a chance to wake up, you passed out.

            Calleigh decided to be by your side instead of Ryan, just in case a male presence would be triggering in your state "Hey Heather, can you open your eyes, can you open your eyes for us." you heard a soft voice pulling you out, so following it, that's when you woke up panicked "You're okay, you're in the hospital. It's okay." Calleigh reassured instantly trying to calm you and Natalia was on your other side, while Ryan and Eric looked on, Ryan wanted to be the one holding you but also he wants to make sure you're okay before making things worse. So catching your breath and realizing you were safe, you wanted answers "What the heck happened?" you asked to no one in particular "You don't remember anything?" Ryan asked cautiously "I do, I remember going under cover to Elena's, and then I appeared back in the crack house where Billy and I were held captive but that doesn't make sense because the Russian guy was there. What happened?" you asked really confused and your eyes were directed mostly towards Ryan "Elena probably thought you were a cop and that your ear piece was a wire." Ryan said making your face caved so immediately he switched places with Natalia when he realized it was safe and took your hand in his offering you comfort "Somehow she was able to drug you." Calleigh told you making you look towards her then she continued to say they found traces of a drug in your system that caused you to hallucinate "She basically hypnotized you." Eric added "What did she had me do?" you asked wanting to know "She had you drive out to the old wheeler mill, and um, that's when Horatio and I found you." Ryan told you the partial truth while giving your hand a squeeze, and knowing Ryan, you knew he wasn't telling you everything but you decided to let it go for now. Then they got into explaining why she did it and it was hard to wrap your head around.

            After feeling well you returned back to the station, just to finish up some important stuff, was currently in the lounge area waiting for Ryan to finish up "Hey beautiful." came Ryan's voice as he slowly approached you "Hey." you were looking out at the scenery "How are you doing?" Ryan asked as his hand went to your lower back and you thought for a moment before replying "I'm good." you said truthfully sending a smile his way "You sure?" Ryan asked with a raised brow and you nodded "Worst has happened to me." you said with a chuckle "I did hate this." Ryan stated "And I would do it again, if it meant catching the bad guy." you said honestly making Ryan sigh "Well I'm putting my foot down on this." Ryan said sternly making you look towards him impressed "Really?" you asked and he nodded "Really." so you chuckled while turning to look back outside "Yes sir." "Let me go get your things and we can head home, just meet me out front." Ryan said and you nodded, so he placed a kiss to your temple before leaving.

            While in the locker room Ryan met with H "No one can know that Heather fired your gun at us, not even her." H instructed Ryan and he nodded completely understanding. "Yes sir." he confirmed, before H left. Before grabbing both your things, Ryan decided to buy a drink for you to use, so he put in the required amount of money and pressed the buttons selecting the drink, but instead of a drink coming out a whole bunch of change did instead, falling all on the floor making Ryan chuckle cause he remembered what the psychic told him "No one's going to believe this." he told himself not believing his luck.

        <p class="story">
            After what happened today, so guys decided to have dinner and a movie at home instead, so Ryan cooked you his famous mac and cheese for dinner, and then after a movie on Netflix. You were both currently laying in the couch, with your head on Ryan's chest as you watched the movie but then you remembered that Ryan was hiding something from you at the hospital "Babe." you asked sitting up and Ryan 'hmm' before looking towards you "I want to ask you something." you said so Ryan sat up now and paused the movie "Sure, what is it?" he asked giving you his attention "Today at the hospital, you didn't tell me everything, about what happened with me." Ryan immediately sighed because you know him so well and he can't tell you because that'll ruin you so he decided to give half of the truth "When we found you, you were screaming at us and to don't come closer and you kept mentioning Billy, but we managed to hold you down, it was bit of struggle, but you passed out then woke up in the hospital." Ryan replied but leaving out all the parts that involved you with a gun and you bought it "I didn't hurt you guys, did I?" you asked as worry over took your features so Ryan shook his head giving you a smile "Of course not baby, you didn't even hurt a fly." Ryan said making you chuckle and helping you feel better about the situation "That's a relief, I don't know how I would of cooped if I knew I did." that right there is why Ryan decided not to tell you anything about shooting at him and H. "You're good beautiful." Ryan said before taking you back in his arms with a kiss to your forehead "Okay, we can continue the movie now." you grinned making Ryan chuckled "Yes mam." so you both entered back into your previous position before Ryan pressed play. You were caught up in the movie while Ryan's mind was stuck on what happened today and what he witnessed knowing that you can't relive it so with those thoughts and tightened his hold on you 'Anything to keep you safe' he thought lastly before turning back to the movie.
