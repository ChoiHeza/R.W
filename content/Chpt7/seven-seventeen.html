            "Remind me to do the laundry when we come in this evening." Ryan said as he was sifting through the closet "Sure, even laundry we're behind, damn." you commented and Ryan chuckled "That's what happens when they're escaped convicts on the loose." Ryan said "Yes, I like that, blaming our negligence on the wicked." both you and Ryan laughed at that "How about we just get a lot done when we come in this evening?" you suggested making Ryan look towards you with a nod "I could get behind that, once, it's not a hectic day cause then we'll be too tired to do anything." Ryan said and you nodded "And that's what been happening the past week." you said with a sigh "Once all the convicts are caught, work should return to normal." Ryan commented "And my nemesis disappears off the face of the earth." you said with a pointed finger and Ryan laughed "And that too." he said going along and that made you grin "I'll make a list of the things we need to do around the house." "And I'm the one that has OCD." Ryan commented and you shrugged "You know I love lists." you said making him chuckle with a nod "Says the woman that claims she isn't OCD." Ryan stated "Well, I don't arrange my cereal in a particular order." you retorted back and Ryan scoffed "But you do that for your books." "Well, that's different, books are meant to be put into a particular order not cereal." you said folding your arms, standing strong on your point, Ryan thought for a moment what to say but he was defeated because you made a valid point "Fine, you win that one." he said making you grin and Ryan just smiled and shook his head at your actions "You know if people were watching us, they would think that we're crazy." Ryan stated "I won't say we're crazy, we just keep ourselves entertained and bantering with each other is a form of that." you said honestly then shrugged "And who cares what people think." you said making Ryan smiled widely at you before coming over and taking you in his arms "You know that I love you right?" Ryan asked looking down at you making you smile "Yes husband of mine, and you know that I love you too?" you asked back Ryan smiled with a nod "Yes my wife." he replied so you tilted your head to the side "And is there any doubt remaining, as to if you're a good husband?" you asked and Ryan shook his head "There's none." that made you grin "For once you're listening to me." you commented and Ryan rolled his eyes "Way to ruin the moment babe." Ryan stated but you shook your head before leaning up to plant your lips on his "Okay, not ruined." Ryan said before kissing you fully.

            "Heather Wolfe." Eric announced as he entered your lab "Whoa, why the full naming Eric Delko?" you said looking at him as he came next to you and he chuckled "Because your assistance is highly needed." he said looking down at you with a drive in hand "Ooo, sounds important. Does it have to do with this beautiful black box in your hand?" you asked smile growing on your face and Eric laughed at your behaviour "Only you get so excited for these kind of things." Eric commented resting the drive on the surface so you shrugged "What can I say, I just love anything tech." "And thanks to that, it makes our jobs so much easier." "You are welcome, so what's the task before us?" you asked pointing to the drive "I managed to copy this from the suspects computer before the FBI confiscated it, but it's encrypted and locked." you nodded understand "Okay, so you need me to decrypt it?" you asked and Eric nodded "Of course, I know you love that stuff." you both chuckled "Okay, I will get this decrypted then call you?" you said looking up at him "You know it." he said as you both shared a side fist bump before he left, and you got to work.

            While encrypting the drive, you were talking to yourself trying to keep focused so you didn't hear Ryan when he entered "Hey beautiful." Ryan announced coming over but he realized you were so focus that you were mumbling and he found it cute, so smiling to himself, he slowly approached "Babe." he said, resting a hand to your lower back, startling you a bit "Oh, hey, sorry. I didn't hear you come in." you said giving him a quick look not wanting to lose focus "What are you doing?" Ryan asked as he looked on but understood nothing you were doing "Decrypting a drive for Eric." that made Ryan smile "I bet you're enjoying yourself." he commented watching your features as they entered a state of happiness before looking at him "You know it." you stated with a wink before turning back to the screen "So what brings you by?" you asked him "Just came for my daily recharge." he said, leaning his head to rest on your shoulder "Chased suspects for the day?" you asked and you felt Ryan nod "Just one, a kid but he's in the hospital in a coma because he swallowed a packet right as we caught him." Ryan said with a sigh "Poor kid, but they just love making you run don't they." you commented with a chuckle and Ryan leaned up at that to look down at his sneakers "At this rate, I should just buy running shoes to work in." he stated and you laughed "Just let me know when." "Why, for you to buy me shoes?" Ryan asked and you nodded "Of course, you know I love buying you shoes." you said with a smile but it got wider because the drive was decrypted "Would you look at that, a piece of cake." you said referring to the drive before turning to Ryan "I had no idea what you just did, but well done." Ryan compliment and you did a little bow "Why thank you, now I gotta get Eric." you said before pulling out your phone "I guess that's my cue to return back to work, see you after?" you nodded "Be good." you said towards him "Always." he replied with a wink and a tap to your lower back before leaving.

            "Okay, next step is finding the password, but I do have some bad news about that." you said turning towards Eric after explaining the decryption as he looked at the screen "You don't know the password?" he asked turning to you now "Well no, but the bad news is that we only get two tries before the drive locks completely and deletes itself." you said with a sigh and Eric you a look "Only two?" he asked and you nodded "And there's nothing else you can do to change that?" you shook your head before explaining "This is just a copy of the drive, not the original device so I can't alter or change anything. That could only be done from the source." he listened on then leaned against the screen "But we’re smart people and we can figure this out, plus I've brought in reinforcements." you told Eric resting a hand on his shoulder and as he was about to ask who, said reinforcements entered the lab "Alright guys, we got this." Walter boomed with a rub of his hands making you chuckle "See, even Walter believes." you said lifting Eric's spirits "Alright, so what's the plan?" he asked looking between you two "Walter and I are going to be doing the searching, while you enter the password. That's just in case they added any other booby traps for us." you instructed and they both nodded "Well let’s get started." Eric said and you all went into position. You and Walter searched for what the password may be, the first one was wrong "You were right Heather, we have thirty seconds before it locks and deletes." Eric said making you and Walter share a quick look before going into over drive. "Okay what about this?" you asked pointing at a combination of letters and Walter it over "I think that might be it, okay Eric, try this." he said alerting Eric as he called out the letters and Eric inputted them "Are you guys sure?" he asked quickly and you both nodded while simultaneously replying "Positive." so Eric quickly hit enter with 2 secs to spare and you guys waited then a ding followed letting you guys know you were in and you all rejoiced high fiving "Nice work guys." you commented "That was stressful." Walter commented making you all nod in agreement "Okay, now let's see what they were hiding." Eric said as he started to pull up files on the drive as you and Walter moved to stand beside him.

            You were in the kitchen drying the dishes and Ryan was in the laundry room taking out the load. He finished before you so he joined you in the kitchen to put away the dishes you just dried. There was a comfortable silence between you two but Ryan was the first to break it. "Can I ask you something?" he asked halting his actions and turned to you "Of course." "The packages that comes here, who are they delivered by?" he asked, and you took nothing by the question "Some man named Dustin." you said drying the last dish and turned to him "Is he good looking?" now this question caught your attention so you looked at him suspiciously, thinking about the guy before answering "He's a cute old man, he was probably good looking back in his day, why?" now it was your turn to ask the question cause Ryan was being weird "No reason." he tried to shrug you off but you weren't buying it, you went and stood in front of him folding your arms "I don't buy it. What's the real reason?" he rubbed his face and sighed before answering "The case I worked on today, you heard of the mailman that was killed?" Ryan asked and you nodded "Well, every apartment or house he delivered to, the wives or girlfriends would sleep with him, so I was just curious about our delivery person." he lowered his head a bit at what he said "Okay, but what does that have to do with our delivery guy?" you asked him super confused cause you weren't catching on. Ryan remained silent not meeting your eyes and you kept wondering why he was acting this way, then suddenly the light bulb in your head went off, oh no, you really couldn't believe he thought that, or the idea even crossed his mind "Ryan Wolfe, you can't be serious." you said sounding a little annoyed "Did you really think, that I could be just like one of those wives?" you asked him with a stern look on your face and now he took a good look at you and saw he messed up "No. It's just -" he stopped short not knowing what to say "Just what Ryan? Tell me?" you were now furious "The thought just crossed my mind, that's all." he said with an apologetic face "It never should of. Ryan we've been together for ten years. Ten years!" upon hearing this, Ryan knew he made a huge mistake, bringing his hands together in a pleading clasp "Heather, beautiful, I'm sorry. I know you would never cheat on me, and you're right, the thought should have never crossed my mind. I trust you Heather, I do." you could hear the sorry in his voice, but you were at least still annoyed a bit, you just sighed, looked at him and walked away not wanting to say anything wrong "Hun, please, I'm sorry." Ryan said stalking after you as you made your way to the living room. You ignored him and sat down, he got down on the ground in front of you kneeling "Heather, I'm sorry. I was wrong for thinking that, very wrong. Please forgive me." he pleaded once a again and you sighed turning to him "Okay." you said folding your arms "Okay?" Ryan asked placing his hands on your thighs "Okay I forgive you." and that made Ryan smile, causing a small smile to appear on your lips "And you know, that I trust you right?" he said running his hands up and down your thighs "I know now." you replied rolling your eyes teasing him and Ryan sighed thinking he's still not in the clear but you corrected him right away "I'm kidding." you chuckled unfolding your hands to hold Ryan's. He released a huge sigh of relief "I know you didn't mean any harm by the question, but it was just the thought of it that hurt me to think you thought of me like that." you reassured him letting him know how you felt. "I understand, and I'm really sorry." he said giving your hands a squeeze which you returned "I know, apology accepted." "So can I get a kiss to truly know that I'm forgiven?" he asked with the widest smile being all cute and of course you caved but you didn’t let him know that "Let me think about it." you teased getting up with a chuckle making your way back to the kitchen to finish Ryan's chore of putting away the dishes. "Babe, you're killing me" he aspirated following you. He leaned against the counter watching you calling for you over and over with different pet names each time and you just kept laughing inside at his desperation. After you were finished putting away the last dish you figured you've tortured him enough "Still want the kiss?" you asked, shutting him up instantly "Yes mam." he said way too happily making his way to you and lifting you up, before placing a kiss on your lips causing you to giggle at the sudden action. You steadied yourself with hands on his shoulders as he spun you around. He stopped putting you down and capturing your face in his hands pulling you in again for another kiss making this one sweeter than the first "I love you so much Heather Wolfe, never forget that." he said looking deeply into your eyes meaning every word "And I love you Ryan Wolfe." you returned the genuinity which made him smile wide "Creep." you said slapping his chest leaving him "You really know how to hurt me." he faked gasp making you laugh.
