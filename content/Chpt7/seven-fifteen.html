            "You know I hate these days." Ryan commented capturing you around your waist "What days?" you asked with a tilt of your head "Where you work the whole day at the office, and I don't get to see your beautiful face throughout my day." you gave him a soft smile at that while taking hold of his face "I'm sorry baby, but the plus side is that you'll get to come home and find me already here." you said trying to add some comfort "Yeah, but I like you near me better." Ryan stated and you chuckled at that before tiptoeing to kiss his lips "Well you'll have me tomorrow, sounds good?" you asked and he nodded "Sound perfect." he said grinning down at you before placing his lips back on yours.

            When you knew Ryan's shift would have been over, you called to let him know that you were going to be late that something important came up, so this was the first time in a while Ryan was home before you. It felt weird to him being in the house without you there, because he was so accustom to the space being filled up by you and today he just felt extra lonely because of the case he worked on. Women were abducted by this couple, tortured, then killed and that just made him thought of you, and what if it was you. He couldn't help but allow the thought to cross his mind so he was currently at home pacing back and forth waiting for your arrival.

            After arriving outside your home, you made it to the front door with keys in hand ready to unlock the door but before you could, the door flung open to a very somewhat puppy eyed looking Ryan. He was already cleaned up from his day at work and was wearing a green t-shirt along with a pair of sweats and his hair was messy. You mirrored his expression because he just looked so cute. "Hi baby." you told him coming through the door and Ryan just held open his arms signalling that he wanted a hug. You just chuckled and closed the door behind you, took off your shoes, placed your bag on the floor by the door and entered his embrace. He wrapped his arms tightly around you holding you very close against him, and he buried his face in your neck inhaling your scent that he had been missing all day "Hi" he finally mumbled from your neck. Your hands that encircled him were rubbing up and down his back "Everything okay hun?" you asked him a little concerned at his behaviour, because he only behaves like this when they are tough cases, ones that remind him of you. You just felt him nod in your neck. It doesn’t seem like he wants to let you go and you just smiled because it felt so nice to be loved. "Tough case today?" you felt him nod again. You let him hold you until he was ready to let go. He lifted his head from your neck and looked at you with so much love in his eyes. With his arms still wrapped around your waist keeping you close, you brought your hands up to cradle his head and pulled him in for a tender loving kiss. The way Ryan was kissing you it felt like he thought you would disappear from him, like this was his last time kissing you, letting you know how much he loved you. Pulling apart you rubbed your thumbs against his cheek and he just leaned into your hands closing his eyes enjoying the way you’re touching him. You couldn’t help but just smile at his actions, they were so cute. "Better?" you asked him and he just opened his eyes looking at you with a smile on his face matching yours "Yes mam." he said with a nod "Good, cause I need to take a bath." you chuckled and he did as well releasing you from his grasps. You took up your bag from the floor by the door and started to make your way to the bedroom when you noticed that Ryan was watching your every step and following you "Going to follow me everywhere?" you asked turning to look at him and he just nodded with a wide smile and you laughed at his response. You made way to the bedroom along with Ryan and he made a beeline for the bed while you went to the desk, unpacking your bag, and putting things where they belonged. Ryan watched everything you did while sitting on the bed. "Mind drawing me a bath please?" you asked him beginning to take off your jewellery "Sure." he said with a salute before going to your ensuite bathroom to draw your bath. You took off your clothes placing them in the hamper and placed a bath robe on your body and made your way to the bathroom. Entering you saw Ryan was sitting at the edge of the tub testing the water with his hand to get the temperature right. You went to the sink and washed your face before applying a face scrub mask to leave on during your bath. "It's ready." Ryan said and you looked towards him in the mirror still applying the scrub "Thanks baby." he came up behind you and wrapped his arms around you placing his head on your shoulder watching you. "You know you're already gorgeous right?" he told you giving your neck a quick kiss from his position "I know." you said with a wink which caused him to roll his eyes and chuckle. He let go of you and smacked your bum before heading out the bathroom and stopping "Hungry?" he asked turning to look at you through the mirror once again and you nodded "What are you craving?" you took a while before answering "Mac n cheese!" you said with the widest grin ever and Ryan laughed leaving the bathroom shouting "Mac n cheese it is!"

            After applying the scrub you took off your robe and got in the tub allowing the warm scented water to flow around you. You laid back and closed your eyes just enjoying the warmth. Today was very cold in the office, the AC unit was giving trouble, and they were only two options, off, which meant heat, and on, which was the full blast setting, there was no in between setting and no one wanted the heat because after all you're working with computers, got to keep them cool, so this warm bath was very much needed. Hearing a knock at the bathroom door you said come in not opening your eyes knowing it's just Ryan "The water is good?" he asked and you nodded your head with a satisfied sigh, after a while you could still feel his presence there in the room so your opened your eyes and met his. He was standing by the bathroom door staring at you lovingly with a smile on his face, and you gestured for him to come in "It's okay for you to come in perv." you said with a chuckle and he rolled his eyes closing the door pulling a bench to sit next to the tub. You reached one hand out for him to take which he did "Want to talk about it?" you asked him, knowing it was about the case he worked on today that had him this way. Ryan is always affectionate but on days like this he is extra about it. After you asked him, he opened his heart and mind and talked about the case, and how it made him feel, and how you crossed his mind, cause one of the victims reminded him of you and you just sat there and listened to everything reassuring him that you're okay, and you're going to be okay cause you know he won't let anything happen to you. After releasing everything he felt so much lighter and better and you loved when you guys communicate with each other because it helps and that's what makes your marriage work so well.

            After he was finished, he released a huge sigh and you took that as him feeling better so you squeezed his hand causing him to look at you "You know that I love you right? So much, with all my being?" you said honestly and it was now his turn to squeeze your hand bringing his other hand to join "I do, you never let me forget it, and I love you back the same, maybe a tad bit more." he said sincerely then teasing using his fingers to measure a small size and you reached up and slapped his arm causing him to laugh and fake pain holding the area and you just rolled your eyes at him going back to laying in the tub closing your eyes. You then felt his hands on your face capturing it being careful not to smudge your face mask. Before you could open your eyes you felt his lips on yours leaving you with a very very passionate kiss making your head spin a little. After he pulled a away he left you wanting more and he realised that but he wanted to be a gremlin, so he smudge your face mask a bit making you gasp, you tried to reach for him but he got out of your reach in time and all you managed to do was splash him with water before he made a quick exit from the bathroom laughing at you along the way. All right, two can play this game.

            Getting out the bath, you quickly washed up and then cleaned your face, drying your skin, before putting on your fancy white satin robe. You made your way to the kitchen standing in the entry way leaning against the wall watching Ryan. He was in front the stove checking the pot so his back was turned to you. "It's going to be ready right now." Ryan said over his shoulder without turning around, he probably sensed your presence. "Okay, dinner is se-" he said turning around but stop talking the moment he laid his eyes on you because of the action you did. You untied the robe and let it fall from your body leaving you bare before his eyes, he was like a fish out of water, and you just smiled triumphantly at yourself. "You know what, dinner can wait." he said making his way towards you picking you up and tossing you over his shoulder making you release a yelp "There is something else I want to eat instead." he said with a slap at your bum making you yelp again, as he his way to the bedroom.
