            "Should I wear a tie?" Ryan asked entering the bathroom meeting your reflection in the mirror "No, it looks good just like that." you commented before turning back to your own reflection but Ryan did not hear a thing you just said because he was caught up in checking you out "Ryan?" you called turning to him when you didn't hear him reply and you saw why, so laughing it broke him out of whatever trance he was in "You okay baby?" you and he swallowed before nodding his head "You just look really gorgeous." he said stunned so you looked down at your outfit and you were dressed no different from Ryan, purple button up, but an off white pencil skirt instead of pants like him. "Why thank you baby, but we're basically dressed the same." you said coming over to him "Can you spin for me?" Ryan asked making you stop in your tracks "Sure." you replied with a giggle and giving Ryan a twirl "Was that good?" you asked facing him back now and you saw he held a look in his eyes, one of love and adoration "Wow, it's like I already knew you were beautiful but damn." you were almost laughing now "What has gotten into you?" you asked being directly in front him now and his hands immediately found your body "Nothing, I'm just appreciating your beauty." Ryan said hands starting to roam from your hips but you had to stop him "Not with this skirt Ryan, remember the colour." you warned so he sighed "Fine, it has to come off later eventually." Ryan said before kissing you forehead "Then you may run your hands where ever." you said Ryan grinned "Can't wait." he said before you guys shared a kiss "Okay, we gotta go." you said back on your heels moving out of Ryan's hold "Yes mam."

            Ryan entered the interrogation room that H and Eric were in because Horatio called for him "You called for me?" Ryan announced as he entered the room "Yeah, I need you to do something" H started and Ryan nodded "Sure, what is it?" "I need you to go undercover, at a match making event. We need to get inside information because they're refusing to share what they know." H instructed so Ryan nodded "Yeah, I could do that." Ryan confirmed but Horatio wasn't finished "But that's not all." H was looking at Ryan directly now, and was giving him a small smile "We need Heather as well." Ryan sighed not already liking this because of the last time you went undercover "We need her to check their computer for whatever they may be hiding while you talk to the girl to see what you can find out." Ryan ran a hand down his face "Does she know already?" Ryan asked and H nodded "She's already on board." 'Of course you are.' Ryan thought, but he was proud that you weren't deterred from a past experience. "Okay H, let's do this." Ryan said ripping off the band aid because when your mind is made, it can't be changed.

            You and Ryan were given your instructions and were told to report in within 30 mins. You both entered as strangers, you entered ten minutes before Ryan and you were currently talking with a random guy, flirting, just killing time until Ryan gave the signal to move. You saw Ryan when he entered and his eyes immediately found yours, so you guys shared a look before Ryan was approached by the guy in charge "Are you married?" the man asked you capturing back your attention "Pardon?" you asked not catching what he said "I'm asking if you're married, because of the tattoo?" he asked pointing to the tattoo that was visible now because you removed your wedding bands for the part so you shook your head "No, it was a drunken mistake, and a bet with friends." you said which was partially true "So what do the initials stand for?" he asked curious "Rachel Williams, my friend, that I lost the bet to." you answered with a chuckle quickly thinking of that on the spot. You decided to take a quick look around to see you spotted Ryan, and you saw he was talking to the targeted girl so you knew it would be soon time to get into action. So you turned back to the guy and you guys talked some more before you felt someone brushed against you from behind, knocking you a bit "Hey, watch it." said the guy you were with towards the person hit knocked you so turning you saw it was Ryan "I'm so sorry guys, bit crowded in here." Ryan apologized then gave you a wink before walking off with the girl, that was the signal. So you turned back towards the guy "I'm so sorry, I think some drink spilled on me, so let me go and get that cleaned up." you told him with a smile and rested a hand on his arm, giving it a squeeze "Sure, no problem, don't be too long." he said with a grin so you returned it "Of course." you said before turning and leaving, heading to the bathroom. So you entered and quickly checked yourself in the mirror before washing your hands and leaving. So instead of returning to the man, you headed towards the office, were you and Ryan agreed to meet. You got there first and Ryan entered a minute later "What took you so long?" you whispered towards him then spotted something very odd "Is that lipstick?" you questioned with a shocked expression "Yes, but we don't have time for that now, the computer is in the room over, so you go there while I check here and please be careful." you nodded "You too and please wipe off that lipstick, did you kiss a fish." you commented before you guys separated.

            As you were searching the computer for anything that could be helpful, you heard a thud, so pausing was you were doing, you moved to hide, while peeping to see if someone was coming, but what you saw brought fear into you. A guard was dragging Ryan's unconscious body towards a different room. So slowly moving, you followed him, keeping hidden. Standing outside the room now you listened in and that's when you heard shouting and water, so peeping in your saw the man was trying to drown Ryan while asking him "Who do you work for?" so not thinking you immediately took up the nearest object which happened to be a big vase, which was perfect. Approaching from behind you swung the vase as hard as you could breaking it on the man's head, making him release Ryan and stumble back and you saw he was about to reach for his gun so you immediately tossed your body over Ryan's and then a shot rang out. You were waiting for the pain, but it never came instead you heard two voices "Heather and Ryan!" shouted H and Eric as they just entered the room and Horatio was the one that shot the man. Realizing that the threat was gone you quickly removed your body from Ryan's and saw he was under you catching his breath, so Eric coming beside you helped turned him to the side, so he could breathe better and any water that he inhaled could come out. "Breathe baby, breathe, I got you." you told Ryan rubbing his back, and there was a look of relief in his eyes as he started breathing normal.

            You were currently sitting at the back of an ambulance with Ryan as he was getting checked out by a paramedic. You were looking on at everything he was doing, just making sure Ryan was getting the care he needed "He doesn't need to go to the hospital right?" you asked the paramedic just as he finished up and he shook his head "Not at the moment no, the drug injected was harmless and there's no water in his lungs but I will say, if you feel anything that doesnâ€™t feel right, take him please." the man instructed so you nodded and thanked him before turning to Ryan, he was currently wrapped in a blanket to keep warm and help dry is soaked clothes "You scared me there for a bit babe." you said taking his hand and Ryan gave you a smile "I'm sorry but I think if you weren't undercover with me, I wouldn't have been so lucky." you shook your head at that "I disagree, Eric and H came in right after I attacked him." you said and Ryan grinned proudly at that "What?" you asked as he was just staring at you "You attacked someone to save my life, and mind you, someone way bigger than you. I'm surprised you weren't scared." Ryan said looking at you lovingly and you were about to reply but Eric appeared "And that's not all she did." he said coming to stand in front of you two "What do you mean?" you asked confused and Ryan was curious to know "She threw her body on yours, when the guard was about to take shot at you." Eric said making Ryan's eyes go wide as his head snapped to look at you "You did?" he asked amazed and you nodded "Of course, I would take a bullet for you any day." you said truthfully and Ryan honestly didn't know how to feel, so he brought you into his embrace catching you off guard and Eric grinned at the interaction and before your hands could wrap around Ryan he pulled back bringing his lips to yours, connecting them in a love filled kiss. "I'll take that as my cue to leave." Eric said but you both paid him no mind.

            "I wasn't finding on the computer, but my search was cut short when I saw Ryan got taken." you were updating H on what happened "And you're okay?" H asked looking you over and you nodded "Yeah, maybe just a couple scraps from breaking the vase on the guys' head, but I'm okay." you said looking over your arms "Okay, we'll get those checked out when you return to the lab and you did well Heather, attacking man saved Ryan's life." you smiled and shrugged "Just doing what any wife would to protect their husband." you said truthfully and Horatio smiled at that "Then you are an amazing wife." H commented making you grin and just then officers dragged in the man that's the owner of this establishment.

            After getting checked out and your cuts treated, with nothing serious, you returned back to work "Heather, I heard what happened?" came Natalia's voice as she entered your lab "Are you okay?" she asked coming towards you and pulling you into her embrace making you chuckle "It's Ryan that should be getting this hug, not me." you commented and she shook her head looking back "No, that was for you, because these things are expected in our line of work but you haven't been exposed as us, which is good." Natalia said warming your heart "Well thank you, I am good though, minus the little cuts here and there." you said showing her your hands and arms "That was pretty brave though, I like that." she said grinning "Well, I guess my body just moved the moment I realized Ryan was in danger." you told her truthfully "And I heard you did something pretty unexpected?" Natalia asked leaving you confused, so seeing that she chuckled before continuing "I heard that you threw yourself on Ryan when the guy was about to take a shot." you waved your hand "Oh, that was nothing." Natalia looked at you in disbelief "What do you mean nothing, you rather yourself take the bullet than Ryan." she stated "Of course, any time." you told her and Natalia just gave you a look of amazement before pulling you in once again for a hug "You sure you don't want to become an officer or an official CSI, because we could really use more people like you." that made you chuckle "Not you too."

            You entered the locker room to see Ryan and Walter were already there "Hey hey." you greeted heading over to your locker "Hey, small bear, I got a question for you." Walter said turning towards you "Yeah, shoot." you said turning to him as well "Is Ryan going to be sleeping on the couch tonight?" you gave him a confused look, completely lost "And why would he be, what did he do?" you asked and Ryan sighed "Nothing, I did nothing." he added but you shook your head "No, Walter, tell me." you said and Walter grinned happy to share "Ryan making out with the suspect." then the look of realization crossed your face "Oh that, I haven't decided yet." you said teasingly with a hint of a smile on your face "Thanks Walter." Ryan commented making you guys laugh "Don't worry babe, you're fine." you reassured Ryan "We were undercover and he was just doing his job, plus I think he made out with a fish." you joked and Walter laughed "What makes you say that?" Walter asked wanting to know "You should of seen the lipstick, it was all over." you said doing circular motions over your mouth for emphasis, making Walter laugh more "That's not true." Ryan commented "Maybe not, but donâ€™t you prefer me to laugh about it than being mad?" you asked with a raised brow towards Ryan "She has a point Wolfe." Walter added and Ryan knew you were right, because he was afraid that you would have been mad. "Then joke away." Ryan said giving you the go "Thank you." you said before sending Walter a wink.

            As you entered the house, shoes off and bag rested down, you stretched, being thankful to be home and Ryan immediately entered your personal space, by wrapping his arms around your body from behind "Have I told you that I love you today?" Ryan asked as your arms joined his "You did. You don't go a day without letting me know." you said truthfully "And you're sure you aren't mad right?" Ryan asked again, because he felt so guilty when the woman made out with him "No Ryan, I'm not, but if you did in fact enjoyed it, then I'll have a reason to be mad." you said truthfully, turning in his arms "No I didn't, I immediately felt repulsed and almost blew my cover and told her that I'm married." he honestly told you as you looked up at him "But it is weird to think about, another woman kissing you, I think it's going to be a while before I kiss you again." you said face going in disgust before stepping out Ryan's arms "But you said you weren't mad." Ryan protested following after you as you headed for the kitchen "I'm not." "Then why won't you kiss me, you kissed me after the incident?" Ryan asked trying to understand "Because another woman's mouth was all over yours, saliva and everything and correction, you kissed me, not the other way around." you said with a shudder thinking about it "But we still kissed none the less." Ryan did have a point "But that was before I had a chance to really think about it." you said making Ryan sigh "What if I brush my teeth, use mouth wash and floss, would you kiss me willingly then?" Ryan questioned so you paused to give him a look "Maybe, I guess." you said after some thought with a shrug so Ryan nodded wasting no time leaving you "Where are you going?" you called after him "To clean my mouth." was the last thing you heard before he was completely out of sight.

            You were currently unpacking your bag in the office area whenever you realized that you haven't seen Ryan as yet because it's been a while so quickly finishing up what you were doing, you headed towards the bathroom. That's when you saw him, hunched over the sink, thoroughly washing his mouth, so chuckling you entered alerting him of your presence "How long are you going to keep washing your mouth?" you asked approaching him from behind "I figured five times were the charm." Ryan said as he stood up turning of the tap "You could of just showered at this point." you commented as he turned to you while drying his face and hands "Yeah, but I wanna do that together." you were in front him now and you could smell the mint off of him "Don't you smell fresh." you said with chuckle and Ryan nodded "Yes, because I want to kiss you, although we already kissed since it happened." Ryan said with a roll of his eyes at the end making you chuckle "I'm sorry." Ryan shook his head "Don't be, cause you're better than me because you if kissed that guy you were talking to, I probably wouldn't have taken it very well." you raised a brow at that "You would have been mad at me?" "No, not you, it would have been him." Ryan said with a nervous laugh and you smiled "That poor guy, he was so boring by the way." Ryan grinned at that "That makes me feel good, knowing you weren't secretly enjoying yourself." Ryan stated, so you tilted your head "Well, the undercover part was fun, minus the you getting drugged and nearly drowning but it allows me to be more involved in your life." you said grinning wide and Ryan laughed "But you were always involved in my life, but I understand what you mean. And at first I really hated it, having you in the field because that's where the danger is but after that gas leak incident in the lab it made me realize that danger is everywhere, so if I have the opportunity to have you by side while working, I'll take it, so that way I can keep an eye on you and keep you safe." your heart softened at that, so you stood closer wrapping your arms around Ryan's neck allowing him to wrap his arms around your waist "Or in this case, me keeping you safe." you said with a wink "And thank you for that and knowing that you can handle yourself I don't have to be in constant state of worry all the time." Ryan chuckled before continuing "My wife is pretty badass." you got shy and giggled at that "You're badass yourself, and I didnâ€™t know how hot it was to watch you work in the field." you commented making Ryan raise his brow "Hot enough that we can shower together but not only shower?" Ryan asked making you chuckle and nod "Of course." you replied so Ryan wasted no time is placing his lips on yours "Finally." he said making you both laugh in the kiss.
