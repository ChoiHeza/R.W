            You were now coming from Frank when an officer called for you "Heather." it was Mona "Yeah, Mona." you replied turning towards "This gentlemen here, David, he's to be escorted to your lab." Mona said gesturing to the guy beside her, it a visually impaired gentleman and recognition crossed your face "You're supposed to help identify some sounds?" you questioned towards him and he nodded with a smile "Yes mam." he replied so you looked towards Mona "Thanks Mona, I got it from her." she nodded before leaving the man to you "So sir, would it be okay if we link arms, so I can direct you?" you questioned coming closer to him and he grin "Yes, that would okay." given permission, you linked your arm with his before you guys walked off together "You're pretty small." he commented and you chuckled "I am, only a hundred and sixty centimeters." you guys engaged in conversation on your way there towards your lab "And you're not from here, America I mean?" he asked curious because he heard a bit of an accent "No, I'm from Barbados." his eyes widened at that "The Caribbean?" you nodded then remembered he can't see you "Yeah, the beautiful isles." you commented and he grinned at that "That's pretty cool." you guys talked some more before reaching outside the lab, but he stopped you "If you don't mind, I would like to ask you a question?" he asked as you both stood in the hallway "Sure." "Are you by any chance together with CSI Wolfe?" he asked making you shock "Yeah, he's my husband, how do you know that?" you asked super curious "I can smell him on you." he replied making you smile "Hopefully it's not a bad smell because that would be unfortunate." you commented with a chuckle and he shook his head with a smile "I'm getting hand sanitizer and his cologne, and I picked up those exact scents from him this morning." David comment leaving you amazed "That's pretty amazing, we could really use someone like you." you stated making him laugh and shake his head "I'm flattered though." with that you guys continued walking and entered your lab where Calleigh and Walter were waiting for him.

            You guys just had dinner and Ryan was currently washing the dishes while you were wiping down the counters. You finished before him so you were currently leaning over the counter observing him from the back and watching the way his muscles moved under his shirt. But then you remembered something from today, that another co-worker told you "Ryan?" you called out to him "Hmm." he replied "Someone told me something today." you started "What is that?" he asked still focusing on the dishes "I heard you flirted with the sketch artist." you commented and that made Ryan stop what he was doing before turning to you "You mean being nice?" Ryan asked and you shrugged "I could only tell you what they told me." you said "Who was it, that told you?" Ryan asked and you titled your head "Does it matter who?" you asked and Ryan nodded "Yeah, because if it was Rachel, that woman does not like you." Ryan said making you confused "Why, what did I do?" Ryan leaned against the counter behind him while folding his arms before reply "It's more like what I did." Ryan said so you gestured for him to continue "Apparently she had a thing for me, and when she found out we're married she didn't take it too well, and I figured she got tired targeting me and has now gone to you." now you were truly curious "And how did she target you exactly?" you asked leaning over the counter "Telling me lies about you, like she caught you flirting with some guy, or how you were touching up some guy, etcetera, but I knew it was all a lie and that's just her trying to get between us" Ryan said with a sigh and you were in awe "I had no idea." you commented "And this has been going on for how long?" you asked "About two months I think." Ryan said with a shrug "Could of warned me." you said and Ryan chuckled "She never came across as a threat just someone that's mad that they couldn't get what they wanted." you shook your head at him "Smug you are, soâ€¦ did you flirt with the sketch artist?" you asked once again and Ryan grin "No beautiful, I did not flirt with the sketch artist, well from my point of view, I was just being nice." Ryan said and you nodded, cause that's how Ryan is, him being polite or nice can come off as flirting. "Okay." you said leaning up now pushing yourself of the counter "That's it?" Ryan asked and you nodded but it was your silence felt uneasy to Ryan, so he walked around the island to stand in front of you "What?" you asked looking up at him "It seems like you don't believe me." Ryan stated with hurt in his eyes so you smiled towards him before taking his hands in yours "I believe you Ryan, trust me. I know you won't willingly do it, and if you did, it won't mean anything" you reassured him "Are you sure?" you nodded with a chuckle "Yes Ryan." and before you gave him chance to ask again, you reached up and took hold of his cheeks before tiptoeing and planting your lips on his and he accepted that as you being okay and believing him.

            "That blind guy from today was such a doll." you commented as you were applying your face mask "The witness?" Ryan asked as he was brushing his teeth and you nodded "You know he figured out we were together based on scent, amazing." you stated remembering the moment still amazed "How?" Ryan asked curious "He said that I smelt like you from when you met him that morning." you replied and Ryan nodded "Wow, that is impressive." he said before turning back to the mirror "And you know what's something I figured from what he told me?" you said still focusing on your mask "What?" "When he told me he smelt hand sanitizer on me, I immediately knew that was definitely from you and in order for him to smell that, you had had to put your hands near his face. So what I'm getting at is, I can't believe you Ryan Wolfe, did the hand wave thing in front his eyes." you said making Ryan look at you in shock "But, how did you get all of that from one smell?" Ryan asked dumbfounded "Because one, I have brain smarts and two, I know my husband and I know he would do something that stupid." you said finishing with your mask before turning towards Ryan and he release a nervous laugh "Sorry." he apologized then washed out his mouth before turning back to you "Are you really?" you said giving him a look and he nodded "I am, because I realized that, that was not very nice of me." Ryan said taking you off guard "Who are you and what have you done to my husband." you said making Ryan chuckle, so he dried off his hands before capturing your waist "I am still the same me babe, I've just realized that I do things without thinking them through, and you've helped me realize that." you grinned at that "Wow, I'm impressed Ryan." you said making him shake his head and he chuckled "Thank you, you're making me a better person." Ryan said before leaning down to peck your lips and instantly regret it "Every time." he said face going into disgust "Ryan Wolfe, why don't you ever learn." he scolded himself going to wash his lips "You never do, it's like you love it." you teased him and Ryan stood back up now "I really don't." and all you could do was laugh at him as his face still held disgust.
