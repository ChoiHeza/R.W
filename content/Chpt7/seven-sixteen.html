            "Is that Ryan Wolfe, dressed in a green shirt trying to make me drop to my knees to serve him." you commented entering the bedroom as Ryan was putting on his socks. Your reply caught him so off guard that it made him laugh "I had no idea a shirt was ever capable of making someone do such things." Ryan commented sitting up and you moved to sit on the floor in front of him between his legs "Well yeah, when it's you, wearing the shirt." you said with a wink and Ryan was taken back by your actions "Baby, what are you doing?" Ryan asked looking down at you, so you took hold of his thighs for support before pulling yourself up onto your knees to bring your face closer to his "Hopefully serve you." you said with a wink and Ryan chuckled shaking his head "You're more bolder than usual." he commented and you shrugged "Well, you get hotter each day." you said truthfully running your hands up and down his thighs now so Ryan checked his watch for the time and sighed "But I soon have to leave home." you were not accepting that "And you're just going to leave me here hungry?" you pouted sitting back on your heels now moving closer and Ryan groaned so he closed his eyes trying to fight it so you decided to run your hands up higher his thighs "Gosh baby, you're my weakness." Ryan caved making you grin happily.

            Unlike Ryan you didn't had to leave early for work because you were working at the office today and only had  a couple of meetings to attend, so it was a short kind of day. The day went by quick but boy was it stressful, and all with the help of your nemesis. So with a huge sigh, you came through the dropping your things and clothes just not bothered and too tired and headed started for the bathroom to run a bath. Turning on some music to help distract you from the day you just had as the water in the tub filled up and boy did it feel like it was taking forever. So moving away you went to the mirror to put up your hair and stared at your reflection and all you saw was an exhausted you looking back and you just checked your face until you figured the tub was filled. Heading over you check and turned it off, before taking off your undergarments, turning up the music and stepping into the water, allowing it to envelope you and you sunk into its warmth with a contented sigh leaving your mouth, leaning back, eyes closed

            "Hun, I'm home." Ryan said coming in through the front door but was met with silence so he called again "Babe?" still nothing, after taking off his shoes at the door he released all your bags were just dropped there and you left a trail of clothes behind and it's very very very rare when Ryan witnesses this so he immediately knew that you're in the bath listening to music, soaking your troubles away because you had an awful day. So leave the mess in its wake for now he walked to the bedroom and as expected heard music coming from the ensuite bathroom. Resting his bag down, he made way to the bathroom door and knocked before opening seeing you laying in the bathtub relaxing with your eyes closed so you didn’t see him when he entered. You heard the music turned off causing you to open your eyes and look towards the source and that's when you saw your husband, a small smile making its way to your face. "Hey, I'm sorry I didn’t hear you come in." you said slowly sitting up to turn your body slightly towards his direction. "I've realized." he smiled making his way toward you, leaning over to place a kiss on your lips with a "Hey beautiful, long day huh?" he asked and you smiled into the kiss before giving him a nod "Yeah, I see you finished a bit earlier than usual, I assumed the case went well." you said leaning back watching Ryan "Yeah, but it was crazy though." he said shedding his cream jacket revealing his green t-shirt underneath, you love to see him in green, hence the events from this morning "Want to join me, I not to long got in?" you asked "You don't mind right?" Ryan asked just to be sure and you nodded "Please, I need you." you said so he smiled and quickly undressed before joining you. He moved to sit behind you as you leaned back on his chest, arms coming around your waist "So, now the case because my interest is peaked." you said giving him your undivided attention and anything to forget your day "You know that local hunting show I love to watch on tv?" he asked and you nodded "What if I said, here in Miami, in real life, there is a human version of it?" he was you. You leaned forward and turned back to give him a very puzzled look, just to think of what he could mean, well you had an idea what he meant, but no, that can't be right but you took a shot "Please don’t tell me humans are hunting humans." you gave him a pleaded look and he nodded his head and a gasp left your mouth "What?! Here in Miami? They are people hunting people?" you asked in total disbelief turning your body to face him completely not expecting this "I wish I could say no, but that was the case today. There was this group that pay a good sum of money to hunt people" he replied with an annoyed look "And how do they get these people?" you asked still not believing what you were hearing "When immigrants are brought in, they sell them off.", you just shook your head at what you were hearing, "There are some people that are just super evil." you said with a shake of your head before going back into Ryan's hold. "Where do they do it?" you asked "In the everglades." hearing Ryan say that made you look his way with a smile "So wait, that means, my husband, Ryan Wolf was in the wildlife." you just laughed and he chuckled "And you wouldn't believe what happened." he said raising his foot out the water, showing off a new bruise he was sporting near his ankle "What got you?" you asked leaning forward to look at it closer "A leech" and you chucked "You poor thing, the wildlife just hates you doesn’t it." you said leaning back "I told Natalia the exact same thing. Remember my other encounters with animals?" he said recalling the previous encounters "How could I forget, you were scared to go hiking for a while." you chuckled at the memory making Ryan tighten his hold on your and he just rolled his eyes while leaning his head back against the tub "Why must my wife treat me this way." Ryan mumbled speaking to himself pretending you weren't there "Because I love you lots." you said hugging his arms tighter around you and that made him lean his head back up "I know you do Mrs. Wolfe." he said leaning down placing kisses along your shoulder "How did I get so lucky?" he asked but more like stated "God just loves you." you told him enjoying the love you were receiving "So, do you want to talk about today?" Ryan asked as he placed a kiss to your temple "What do you mean?" you asked and Ryan chuckled "Babe, you left a trail of clothes and your bags are still by the front door, so I know something is wrong." you sighed at that slouching more in Ryan's hold "That bastard happened, just know it's him." "You gotta stop letting him get to you." Ryan said and that made you sit up, turning to him, giving a hard glare his way and caused him to raise his hands in defense "I'm sorry, I take it back, maybe I should hire a hitman instead." Ryan said making you smile now "That's better." you said before going back to lay on him "You know you can be scary." Ryan commented and you shrugged "It's only when you give me stupid replies." and Ryan chuckled "That is fair, but seriously babe.." Ryan started making you turn in his lap to straddle him "Don't let him get to you, because that's exactly what he wants, so if you approach him constantly with a calm demeanor, it's going to annoy the living shit out of him." Ryan said and he was right "That does sound pretty sweet." you said smiling now and Ryan chuckled "Exactly, and you'll be perfect, like this body on top of me." Ryan said with a wink making you blush "Okay pervert." you commented and Ryan gasped "Says the woman that down on her knees in front of me this morning." you gave a shy smile at that "Maybe that happened." you said avoiding his eye contact and Ryan laughed at your behaviour "Now you're playing innocent." he said bringing his hands down your body to your hips, bringing his body closer to yours "But that's okay, good or bad, I still want to return the favour because I didn't had enough time this morning to get down on my knees for you." Ryan said making you blush harder and smile wider "Really?" you asked bringing your hands to rest on his shoulder and Ryan nodded "Yeah, I want to make you feel just as good or even better." he said making you grow warmer "I will not say no to that." you said before crashing your lips against his.
