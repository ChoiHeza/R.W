            You were back in bed currently watching Ryan as he got ready for work, when he was finished dressed you released a whistle making him chuckle as he looked back to you "Don't you look sexy." you complimented sitting up now eyeing Ryan from head to toe "I know that look babe, it's a no." Ryan said making you pout "How could you tell me no?" you asked with a frown and Ryan sighed "Remember the last we had sex that made us late for work, we got arrested, for murder." Ryan said making you chuckle because as ridiculous as it sounds, it was true "But Settler is out of our lives." you whined getting up now, going over to Ryan "I know, but it's going to be a tough day, we gotta find the escaped convicts." Ryan said making you sigh as you stood in front him now "I guess that outweighs sex with your wife or whatever." you said with a role of your eyes making Ryan chuckle as he took hold of your bare waist "When you put it like that, you make it sound like I'm a bad husband." Ryan commented but you shook your head "You're anything but, because in your case you're picking the best option. Catching the criminals than being with you wife." you stated and Ryan laughed "No matter how you word it, I still come off as bad." you released a soft laugh "You aren't, you're the best." you said tiptoeing, placing your lips on his, giving him the kind of kiss, that makes him weak and cave too you and Ryan caught on to what you were doing. So he pulled you away "I know what you're doing baby and as much as I hate it, I have to stop you or I'm going to be very very late for work." Ryan said dragging out the second 'very' "Fine, was worth a shot." you said starting to walk away, but Ryan pulled you back "I promise when I come home, I'm going to make it up to." Ryan said caressing your hips and waist "I could always just help myself during the day instead of waiting for you." you commented making Ryan groan and grip your hips tightly "Don't you dare." he warned and that just made you want him more "Yes sir." you complied and Ryan gave you a kiss for that. Checking his watch he saw it was time for him to go "I have to go." he said leaving another deep kiss on your lips before detaching himself from you "Okay baby, be careful." you told him and he nodded "Always and please wait for me." you grinned up at him "I will." and he returned it "That's my girl." he said with a kiss and squeeze to your bum and just like that he was gone after a round of 'byes'.

            Being your off day, you managed to run some errands and got some house work done, that including cooking dinner so that it would be finished the moment before Ryan comes home. Just as you turned off the stove, your phone rang and saw it was Ryan. "Hey babe." you answered "Hey beautiful, I come with apologies." the moment he said that you knew exactly what he was going to say "You have to work late." you stated and you heard Ryan sigh "Yeah, I'm sorry." "No, don't apologize, I saw the news about the escaped convicts so I understand how hectic it is for you guys right now." you reassured letting him know you understood "You have no idea, so I'm not sure what time I'll be in." he told you "That's okay, do what you have to do." you said with a smile and Ryan smiled himself "Do you know how amazing you are, thank you for understanding." Ryan said making you giggle "Always, I love you, be safe and I'll see you when you come in." you told him "With you as my wife, I'm always safe, and I love you too. I might call or message when I'm leaving work." "Okay. Now go." "Yes mam." you heard Ryan chuckle before you both said your 'byes'.

            It was night time when Ryan finished work and he messaged letting you know that he's coming home but the message went unseen, so he figured you were either busy with something or sleeping. He wanted to buy you flowers but everywhere that sold flowers were close, so he decided he'll get them for you tomorrow. Unlocking the door and entering, he was greeted with the sound of the television on. The house was dark except for the kitchen light. "Beautiful?" Ryan called out for you but got no response so he called again but a bit louder this time as he took of his shoes but still nothing. So resting down his keys and bag and came further into the house and that's when he spotted you. Passed out on the sofa, laying on your stomach with your hand hung off the side. Catching sight of you softened Ryan's heart bringing a smile to his face. He slowly walked over to you and stooped down to your side bringing himself to your level. With the tv luminating the features of your face, Ryan smiled admiring your beauty "So beautiful." he said while bring a hand up to lightly brush against your cheek. "Sorry for being late." he told you before standing up going to lift you bridal style. When he you felt were secured in his arms, he headed in the direction of the bedroom, to lay you in bed so you would be more comfortable. He made sure to move carefully and slowly to not wake you and he succeeded arriving the bedroom with you still deep in sleep. He placed you carefully on the bed before bringing the blanket to cover your body. Leaning down, he kissed your forehead before heading off to get something to eat then shower.

            You woke up while Ryan was just finishing his shower, so with a stretch you got up and yawned trying to catch yourself. As you were there lost in a daze, Ryan exited the bathroom turning on the bedroom light and that's when he saw you sitting up clearly still sleepy "Look who's awake." he said smiling towards you and all you managed to do was lazily wave your hand. "I didn't wake you right?" Ryan asked and you shook your head "Still sleepy?" Ryan asked this time with a chuckle and you just nodded "Then go back to sleep." Ryan suggested and you shook your head before finally speaking "I don't want to miss you getting dressed." that made Ryan laugh "But your eyes aren't even open." Ryan stated after looking at you "They don't need to be, I can just imagine it as you move around." you commented yawning once more and Ryan just found you funny in this moment "Did you eat something? Did you see the dinner I cooked?" you asked finally opening your eyes now and saw that Ryan just put on his sweat shorts "Yes I did, and it was delicious as always." he said coming over to the bed now and that made you smile "But I do have one critique though." that comment made you wake up even more "What?" you asked fully aware now and Ryan joined you on the bed before explaining "I'm afraid that I might get fat again." Ryan said with a hint of a smile making you chuckle "Don't scare me like that Ryan." you said giving him a smack and Ryan laughed "I'm sorry baby." with Ryan close to you now, you wrapped your arms around him, bringing him down to lay on you and Ryan gladly accepted it "I'm sorry for coming home late." Ryan apologized squeezing you tighter "You know you don't have to apologize for that right, because I understand." you reassured him but Ryan leaned up shaking his head "No, let me have this one because I really do feel sorry." Ryan said sincerely so you gave him a smile "Okay, then apology accepted." you said making Ryan smile and you shook your head "You're so weird." Ryan chuckled before laying back on your chest. While in that position you and Ryan talked about both your day, before talking about random things, and while you were telling him something, you realized he became extra quite, so leaning up to look at him, you realized he fell asleep and that brought a smile to your face.
