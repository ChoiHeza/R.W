            "You know, I really hate days like these." you commented packing your bag for work "And what is that exactly?" Ryan asked turning to you as he was buttoning up his shirt "Working at the office away from you while having cramps." you stated with a sigh so Ryan started to make his way over towards you "Period came this morning?" Ryan asked standing next to you now "Not as yet but it's near based on the pre cramps" you replied giving him a quick look "I'm sorry." Ryan comforted bring his hand to rest on your lower back massaging it "Sadly I can't blame this on you." you said with a chuckle and Ryan grinned "Well, I can't take the pain away but I can help you with it." your eyes softened at that "Thank you but I already have pain killers with me." you commented so Ryan nodded "That's okay, I'll just be in charge of indulging you in your cravings, cuddles and massages. Whatever else it is that you may need." Ryan said bringing his arms to gently wrap around your waist, so you decided to lean forward and rest your head on his chest. "Thank you babe, I'll very much need it." you said wrapping your arms around him now looking up at him as he looked down at you "Anything for you." Ryan said with a smile before leaning his head down to meet your lips. "And if you need anything throughout the day, don't hesitate to call." you nodded going back to rest on his chest as he brought his chin to rest on the top of your head.

            For once you didn’t have to come home and be sitting in front your computer doing work. You've managed to complete everything you needed at work and no bug fixes to be done which you were very thankful for so you were currently being lazy at the moment laying on the sofa watching tv. You didn't had to cook any dinner because it's the day you and Ryan would order in so you were just waiting for him to come home to see what he would want. Thirty minutes had passed before you heard Ryan came in "Hey babe, I'm home." you heard his voice resonate throw the house "Living room." you replied back loud enough for him to hear. You honestly didn't had the energy to move to greet Ryan at the door, you heard his chuckle near you "Well look at you." he appeared in your field of vision kneeling beside the sofa to reach your level "Someone's clearly had a long day." he leaned in and placed a kiss on your forehead "Sort of, but just for once I didn’t had anything to work on at home cause I managed to finish it all today." "Lucky you, was waiting for me to order?" he asked getting back up "Yes sir, what do you feel like eating?" you asked getting up yourself "Hmmm." Ryan pretended to think while wrapping his arms around you pulling you against him "I'm listening sir, what is it that you would like to eat?" you said playing along cause you know he was being a flirt "Can I eat you Mrs. Wolfe?" he said with a smirk leaning in to nuzzle his face into your neck inhaling your scent and then started to pepper kisses "That's not food Ryan." you told him with a giggle because he was tickling you and before Ryan could continue his flirting your stomach released a growl causing you both to laugh "Fine, food it is then." he said defeated then looked towards your stomach "You win." and gave it a tap before heading off to the bedroom "So what do feel like eating babe?" you followed after him "How does burger and fries sound?" he asked "Ooo, that actually sounds perfect. I'll go place the order. The usual right?" you asked hanging back by the bedroom entrance as you watched Ryan put away his stuff "Yes mam." you nodded and made way to the kitchen to get the menus to place the order.

            After ordering you came back to the bedroom and heard Ryan was in the shower so you plopped yourself down on the bed and decided to play a game on your phone to kill time. "How much longer till it arrives?" Ryan asked coming from the bathroom "Should 15 minutes more." and Ryan hummed a response. Taking your eyes from your phone for a quick second, you saw he was standing in front the dresser with his back turned to you, so you quickly left your game and opened the camera to snap some quick pictures before he turns around and catches you, so you quickly switched back to the game and continued playing. After Ryan was finished dressed, in a white t-shirt and basketball shorts he joined you on the bed laying against the headboard. "What are you playing?" he asked while he turned on the tv "Virtual Life." you replied back and Ryan released a chuckle from hearing what you said "What?" "Just reminded me of today's case." you released an oooo before sitting up to look towards Ryan "I'm listening." Ryan settled on a random channel and looked towards you "Let me ask you a question." you nodded putting down your phone giving Ryan your undivided attention "How long have you lived in Miami?" "Ten years, why?" you asked back "And you've come to realize that this country isn't normal right." he said and you laughed at his reply agreeing "Have you ever heard of a company that turns your life into a virtual game?" "You mean like, they create a video game based on your life?" "Try reversing it." you thought for a moment "Um, they make your life based on a video game?" you said more like asked because you weren't sure "You got it, sort of. If you want someone you know to experience life like they're living in a video game, or even a movie for example, they do that for you, without letting the said player know." Ryan tried to tell you the best way he could of "I think I get it. For example, let's say I want them to give your life a bit more drama, like kidnap you, involve you in a fake bank robbery, or have you kill someone, well fake kill someone, but you wouldn't know that, because you'll think all of it is real." you said placing yourself to sit in front of Ryan crossed leg and he joined you "Exactly like that." he said with a pointed finger "How is that even legal, and that's seriously messed up. So what happened, the game went wrong and the 'player' got killed?" you asked placing air quotes on player. "The game did went wrong, but it was one of the npcs that got killed." it's Ryan phrasing that made you release a laugh unintentionally "I'm sorry, but you got me when you said npc." you said covering your mouth with your hand, constantly apologizing and Ryan just chuckled a bit "It's okay" he waited for you to sober up and you gestured for him to continue "She got killed because the man's wife thought he was cheating on her, but he never was and she didn't know that he was caught up in this game." a curious expression crossed your features "So who planned it for him then?" you asked "It was his brother, because he said his brother's life was boring and he wanted him to enjoy it more." you gave Ryan a raised brow "And he couldn't have thought of any other possible way to do that?" you asked shaking your head before continuing "So who was held responsible?" "The wife was arrested but also the company got charged." Ryan replied "That company shouldn't even have existed in the first place." but a light bulb went off in your head and Ryan saw the change in your expression "What is it?" "I just got an idea for a new project." you said quickly getting up from the bed going for your laptop "Heather Amanda Wolfe, you better not be creating something exactly like that." you came back with your laptop, wide smile on your face and sat back on the bed "Well, sort of, but instead of a real life thing, where people could actually get hurt, more like a website based thing for people to traverse. Making them explore new and exciting things the world has to offer." laptop opened and you started typing away your ideas "I think I get where you're coming from." not wanting to lose your thoughts, you gave Ryan a quick yeah so he just chuckled and picked back up the remotes turning back to the tv cause he knows when you get into brainstorm mode, you're going to hear nothing that comes out his mouth.

            You guys just finished eat and were on the sofa, Ryan watching tv while you were reading "Babe." Ryan called capturing your attention so you replied with a hum, eyes not leaving your book "What are you reading?" Ryan asked and that made you look up over your book to meet eyes "Why?" you asked with a raised brow while lowering your book and Ryan shrugged "Just curious, because your toes keep flexing from time to time." Ryan commented making a smile appear on your face that you tried to keep back "No comment." you said bringing the book back up avoiding Ryan's gaze and he chuckled "Now I'm really curious." Ryan said and before you had time to react, he snatched the book from your hands making you squeal, "No!" you expressed chasing after the book but he kept it out of reach and gave you a look so you sighed defeated and sat back down as he smiled triumphantly before bringing the book down to skim the pages you just read. "Hmm." you said while going over them with a smile starting to grow on his lips "I can see why your toes were curling." he commented making you hide your face behind your hands with a groan and Ryan chuckled "He did what?" Ryan asked as he was reading a line before looking towards you "Heather Amanda Wolfe, is this what you're over there calmly reading every time?" Ryan asked in amazement, still flipping through the pages "Not every time, I read a lot of crime and mystery books too." you said bringing your hands down "I know that but I didn't know about these books." he said finding another interesting line before reading it out loud "Babe, wow." Ryan said after reading the line and you honestly felt embarrassed "I need to leave." you said starting to get up but Ryan took hold of your ankle "No no, I now see where your very intriguing mind comes from." he said closing the book but making sure to mark your page "Done making fun of me now?" you asked and Ryan chuckled pulling you closer to straddle his lab "I was never making fun of you, I just found it very interesting, but I have one question?" Ryan asked so you nodded "How do you read these so calmly?" he asked actually really curious "Just years of practice." you said with a shrug and Ryan chuckled "So which parts makes your toes curl?" and you smiled shaking your head "You wouldn't believe me if I told you." "Come on, tell me, I won't judge." Ryan stated so you gave him a look and he nodded "I promise." he reassured so you told him "It's the fluff scenes that makes my body react, not the spicy parts." Ryan was surprised because that wasn't the answer he was expected "Really?" he asked and you nodded "Really, those make my toes curl." you said smiling and Ryan thought about it for a bit more "Then again you are Ace." he said and you nodded "Yeah, the sex parts are just eh, sometimes I skip them. Yeah, they're spicy but I don't read the book for them." you said honestly and Ryan got to thinking even more "Then I'm really curious about something, what about sex with me?" Ryan asked and you smiled "It's amazing but that's different, it's because I have an emotional connection with you that makes me want to have it with you or look forward to it." that made Ryan grin "Do you know how amazing it is to hear you say that." "What do you mean?" you asked with a tilt of your head "I never have to worry about you thinking about another guy in a sexual kind of way." you chuckled at that "That's what you got from that?" you asked and Ryan nodded so you shook your head at him "Can I go back to reading my book now please?" you asked nicely and Ryan nodded "You may." he said before giving you a kiss to release you, so you took back up your book, and went back into your previous position returning to the page you were reading while Ryan turned back to the tv but still couldn't get his mind off the book "Have you ever tried anything from the books you've read with me?" Ryan asked looking down at you for a moment "Sexual wise?" you asked eyes still remaining on your book "Yeah." Ryan confirmed so you smirked giving him a quick look "What do you think?" you said with a wink before looking back at your book and Ryan grinned 'I think I'm going book shopping tomorrow' he thought before focusing back on tv.
