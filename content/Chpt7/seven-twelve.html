            Ryan and Walter arrived at the crime scene together which happened to be a venue that hosts roller derby "Roller derby is real man, wait to you see it." Walter told Ryan as they watched the victim being carried out in a body bag "Wolfe, you've never been to the roller derby before?" Walter yelled because inside the main area was pretty loud "I haven't been on roller skates since junior high." Ryan yelled back and they made their way further into the chaos "You're missing out man." Walter said looking down at him "That was fifty pounds ago." Ryan commented "These women are badass" Walter said with a laugh "They're badass? They're girls on roller skates, how badass can they be?" Ryan asked completely unaware of the sport. As they reached the entrance to the arena an argument started to break out between players and Ryan and Walter looked on "Okay, now that's the sexiest and scariest thing, I've ever seen." Ryan said making Walter laugh "I told you!" Walter said giving him a quick look "Jeez." Ryan said as they both looked on getting caught up but the argument started to get louder and worse, so they decided it was time to intervene. Resting down their kits they headed into the direction of growing players surrounding the fight. They both were shouting to stop the fight but were failing miserably and that resulted in Ryan getting sucker punched in the jaw, but with Walter getting louder the feud started to diffuse and they broke them up.

            As Ryan was interrogating one the girls from the opposite team under the bleachers, she mentioned about being on penalty so you were going to have to come to the scene to check out the footage and when she left, while rolling away, she lifted up her skirt and smacked her bum for Ryan to see and Ryan shook his head "This is going to be an interesting day." he said to himself before pulling out his phone to give you a call about to come and check out some footage.

            When you arrived an officer came to show you the way, but you told him you're familiar already, and entering the building just brought back some memories for you, because you were a derby girl yourself just been a long time, you played back in Barbados and in Miami when you and Ryan were on a break, cause you had a lot of time to kill plus it was an amazing stress reliever. Heading to the monitor they had set up, you got to work by plugging in a cam recorder that was used to record the game "Hey, small bear, you got that game footage queued up?" Walter asked as he came to stand beside you "Yup, ready for playback." you said turning to the monitor now. As you hit play, you both looked on, some girls fell on screen after being pushed "These bring back some memories." you commented looking on and Walter gave you a look "You know about roller derby?" he asked intrigued "Know about it? I've played it." you said making Walter look at you wide eyed "No way Heather, you played roller derby?" you nodded with a grin "Yes sir, and boy is it a great stress reliever." you stated and Walter was in disbelief "I honestly can't believe it. I knew you were badass but this is a different level of badass." he said and you two high fived at that before looking back at the footage. At the same time Ryan approached "Is that the footage?" Ryan asked as he stood to your other side "Yeah." you replied, eyes not leaving the screen "Wolfe, why did you act like you didn't know about roller derby?" Walter asked looking over you towards Ryan "What do you mean, I actually know nothing about it." Ryan stated and you gave a shy smile between the two "About that…" you started "Ryan doesn't know?" Walter asked catching on and you shook your head "What don't I know?" Ryan asked curious so you gave Walter a look before turning back to Ryan "It's nothing important, we can talk about it back at the lab." you stated making everyone watch back the video and that resulted in Walter chuckling. You both watched how the rest of the events played out and the statement that Ryan received from Olivia was in fact true "So she was definitely in the sin bin." you pointed out and that made Ryan look towards you "How do you know that term?" he was curious to know but something happened on screen causing Walter to make a noise pulling you both back towards the video before you had a chance to reply.

            As the investigation went on, the evidence lead to show that Connie was struck in the back with an elbow pad, so all the players were asked to come down to the station to hand in their personal elbow pads. "Ryan." you called out as you were walking in the hallway and Ryan paused waiting till you catch up "Hey babe." you were next to him now, tablet in hand and you guys continued walking "Where are you off to?" you asked him "We asked the players to bring in their elbow pads so I'm heading their direction to help collect them." Ryan stated and a smile appeared on your face "I really hope none of them are responsible." you said truthfully because some of these girls you know, Ryan was just about to ask you something but the girls came into view making Ryan forget what he wanted to ask you "Looks like your suspects are here." you gestured towards them, while looking through recognizing some of the faces, so you stayed back while Ryan went forward and got to work. In the meantime, while Ryan and Walter were giving them instructions one of the girls spotted you and a smile appeared on her face so she waved making you wave back with a smile of your own, then she spotted Ryan and approached him. She apologized for punching him earlier when he was trying to break apart the fight "That's okay, it was a nice punch." he said making her nod then she pointed towards the direction behind him "Can I go say hello?" she asked Ryan making him look to see where she was pointing and it was you, so now Ryan was intrigued "Yeah, sure." Ryan said escorting her. "Heather, it's been a while." she said making you grin and you both shared a tight hug "Where have you been?" she asked "Busy, like you wouldn't believe, but I haven’t forgotten you guys." you stated and in the mean while Ryan looked on at the interaction "Oh by the way, this is Ryan." you told her gesturing your head towards Ryan and her eyes widened "The Ryan, your husband?" she asked and you nodded "Now I don't feel so bad for punching you." she said looking down on him and now it was your turn to open your eyes "You punched him?" "It was a misunderstanding." she said starting to explain but her name was called by Walter "Look, let's meet up after this is over." she said and you nodded sharing a smile believe she left you both. Now Ryan moved to stand in front of you, arms folded "So what are you not telling me?" Ryan asked making you sigh "I guess no more hiding. I used to play roller derby." you said and now Ryan was in shock but before he had time to ask his millions of questions Walter called for him "This is not over." he stated with a pointed finger before leaving you, heading back to the group.

            "Okay Heather, we have to talk." Ryan voiced as he entered the lab "Oooo, someone's in trouble." Dave commented behind you making you look back "You shush." Dave chuckled, then you turned to Ryan "Do we have to talk now?" you asked and he nodded "Yes, we can't keep putting this off." Ryan said standing next to you now so you sighed "Fine, what do you want to know?" Ryan had his arms folded now "For how long?" he asked "Before I moved here, and I picked it back up when we were on a break." you stated "Why didn't I know about this?" you shrugged "I guess the topic never came up." you said truthfully "Are you mad?" you asked and Ryan unfolded his arms, shaking his head "Of course not, I'm just confused as to why I never knew about this." "Well no one knew, I guess it was a me thing." you said and Ryan understood "Now I know, and I would love to know more." Ryan said with a smirk making you chuckle "Dave is here. Let’s not scar him." you whispered and at that moment Ryan phone rang "Saved by the bell." he said before tapping your lower back an leaving with the phone to his ear.

            "Hey guys." you greeted as you entered the locker room "Hey, are you coming with us, to the tribute for Connie?" Natalia asked turning towards you "Well, I'm going to be there, but not as a spectator." you commented and Walter was listening on and he gasped "Small bear, don't tell me you're going to be playing." he said making Natalia look at you now "What does he mean? You play?" she asked curious and you nodded "Yeah, well sort of, and they asked me fill in since they're one short." you commented and they were both amazed "No way. I'm sorry but you're so small and sweet." Natalia said making you laugh and Walter laugh "You clearly haven't seen her watching basketball." Walter commented and at that moment Ryan entered with Eric and Calleigh "You guys still going?" Eric asked as he went over to his locker "Yeah, but apparently one of us are playing." Natalia said allowing everyone to give her a confused look but Ryan quickly caught on "You're playing?" Ryan asked directing the question towards you and you nodded. Now everyone had the look of amazement on their face "Wait, hold on, you play?!" Eric asked and you nodded "To save you guys some time and questions because I soon have to leave to meet the girls and get ready, I used to play before I moved here to live and I picked it back up when Ryan and I were on a break." you said closing your locker now, and turning to them with bag in hand "I know, it's hard to believe based on my structure but when you guys come, you'll see me play and all your questions will be answered." you said starting to make your leave, leaving them all stunned but making sure to give Ryan a touch.
