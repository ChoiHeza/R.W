            "Do you have to go to the office today?" Ryan asked as you both were eating breaking, him cereal and you oats. You gave a nod while your mouth was full and replied when it was emptied "Yeah, how do you know?" you asked curious and Ryan chuckled "After that conversation you had with your nemesis last night, it's just a feeling." Ryan said making you laugh "You're right, and I'm going there to kill him, so when you get the 911 call of a murder, you know nothing, I was never there." you joked and Ryan laughed "You got it babe, I'll make the evidence lead to someone else, I have done it before and it's not that hard." Ryan stated and that earned a look from you "You've what?!" you asked all joking gone from your voice and Ryan realized what he said so he gave a nervous laugh "What are you talking about?" he asked hoping to throw you off guard but he knows you're way smarter than that "No no, explain yourself Ryan." you said giving him your full attention "Just keep in mind, I was doing this to keep you and Billy alive." then a look a recognition crossed your face before Ryan continued "When the Russians had you guys I had to fabricate evidence to clear their names from the murder and pin it on an innocent guy." Ryan said not proud of it but he did what he had to "And did it work?" you asked curious and he nodded "Because I knew what I was doing." you never knew he did that "I never knew, I'm sorry." you said and Ryan shook his head with a smile "That's the past, they're behind us." he said you smiled in agreement "So… if I really killed that guy you would be able to clear my name?" you asked going back in to a joking mode and Ryan chuckled "Of course baby, but that doesn't gave you permission to kill people as you feel like." Ryan joked back making you scoff "Not fair." you playfully sulked going back to your oats "Life isn't fair babe, plus I know you can handle the guy, and there is a little worry that may actually kill him but you'll control that." Ryan said with a chuckle and you joined "Thanks babe." "So what time do you leave for the office?" Ryan asked as he ate more of his cereal "Maybe afternoon, he has a meeting scheduled for two and only Lord knows what that's going to be about." you said with a roll of your eyes "Well, since you're going to be home before me, I'll bring you home some treats to help you lift your day and we could do whatever you want to wind down the day." Ryan said making you smile "Really?" you asked and he nodded "Of course, you know I love keeping you happy." "And you do a very good job at that." you commented "Why thank you." Ryan said with a wink making you giggle.

            "Good morning." came Dave's voice as he entered the lab "Hey, Morning." you replied giving him a quick look but had to do a double take "Dave Benton, what has happened to your hair?" you asked in complete shock, because his glorious long hair was all gone "I cut it off, I got tired of it." he said with a laugh at your reaction and you hand clutched your chest cause lowkey his words hurt a little bit "For some reason those words hurt my heart." you said and Dave laughed more "Why, is the new look not good." he asked "No, you look really nice, but it's just the sudden cutting of hair that hurts my black girls' heart." you said Dave finally understood "Well I'm sorry, I should of gave you warning." you waved your hand "It's okay, I'll recover." you joked before going closer "So how does it feel?" you asked curios and Dave thought for a moment while moving his head "It's freeing, and now it's just wash and go." you nodded completely understanding that "I get that, but you look good." you complimented with a smile which he returned "Thank you Heather. I'm glad you approved, my girlfriend wasn't that easy to convince." "Yikes, you didn't warn her?" you asked and Dave shook his head "It was a spur of the moment kind of thing." "But she loves it now though, right?" Dave nodded with a grin "Very much, she won't stop touching my head." that made you chuckle "Isn't that adorable." you commented.

            You were on your way to look for Ryan to let him know you were soon going to leave when you something him from outside the lab talking to a new face, and you assumed they were discussing the case, because she was showing him something on a piece of clothing, so not wanting to disturbed you stood and looked on and you could clearly see that Ryan was making her flustered, you chuckled at it because her interactions were cute and not once did Ryan pick up on anything. When you figured they were finished you knocked on the glass and entered "Hey, can I borrow CSI Wolfe for a minute?" you asked just in case they weren't finished "Yeah, we're finished here, good job new girl." Ryan said towards her and you saw her ears went red, so you tried your best to keep the grin from your face. With that Ryan walked out with you and you guys headed for the elevator "If I didn't know any better Wolfe, I would say that you were flirting with her in front your wife." you joked and Ryan chuckled "Just me being nice babe, it's first day, can't always be mean." you nodded at that "Right, you gotta show them your good side first." you commented and Ryan gave you a look "What do you mean by that, I'm all good sides." Ryan said pressing the elevator button as you guy reached making you laugh "Sure babe, sure. What's here name?" you asked "Molly something." he replied and you shook your head "Right, and you're good on all side." you teased as the doors opened and you guys stepped inside "Not you giving me hassle as I'm escorting you to the locker room." Ryan commented smiling down at you hitting another button "Which I totally love you for by the way." you said with a quick kiss to his cheek after the doors closed because the elevator doesn’t have a camera "But I'm not feeling the love." he said looking at you with a smirk "Maybe I need more convincing." you rolled your eyes at that "Taking advantage of the elevator?" you asked with a raised brow and nodded "Of course." so compiling you quickly leaned up as Ryan met you half way for you guys to share a quick kiss "The next time I'm going to be able to kiss these lips is this evening when I get home." Ryan sulked "That time will get here right now." you said and Ryan sighed "I beg to differ."

            You were sitting at the kitchen island, laptop in front of you working because you received an email from your nemesis deciding to make your evening longer so that's what you were doing when you heard the front door open, "Honey, I'm home!" came Ryan's voice, so needing to take a break from your work and his evil schemes, you got up to meet Ryan at the front door "Hey babe, please save me." you said making your way to him causing a chuckle to leave his lips "Okay, I'll save you, but could you help me out first?" Ryan asked as you got closer, seeing him taking off his shoes but he seemed to be having a bit of trouble because he had something extra in his hand "Of course, let me." so you approached him and took the largest bag from him. It looked very foreign to you "What is it?" you asked, gesturing to it "That's a surprise." he said with the biggest smile ever plastered on his face. After he took off his shoes you both went to back to the kitchen and he rest down his work bag on the island after you pushed your laptop to the side. "When I got to my locker after the shift, I saw that there." he said taking off his jacket placing it over the back of one of the island chairs. He took the bag from you leaning it against the island before opening it up and inside was a telescope and you gasp "No way! The team got you that?" you asked surprised and inspecting it with a wide grin on your face that matched Ryan's "Yeah!" he replied but then your brain started turning "Wait, so how did they know about an old passion of yours? Don't tell me you told them the story of your bully?" you asked looking towards him and he sighed "I told Delko, and he told the others." you just laughed at it "I bet they found it funny as well?" you asked and Ryan just nodded his head smiling the whole time but you couldn’t contain your laughter "Babe I'm so sorry but that story was just the cutest." you told him bringing your hands to clasp his face "It's okay, looking back it is funny." he said while bringing his hands to wrap around your waist pulling you close towards him "Because my future turned out to be pretty amazing." he said leaning in to give you a kiss on your lips which you returned, and you guys just shared that moment for a bit, enjoying the presence of each other. You both broke apart and went back to looking at the telescope "So where are you thinking of putting it?" you asked him running your hands along the design "Maybe by the window in the bedroom." and you agreed that was the perfect place for it. "So what made you bring up your old bully?" you asked following him through the house as he took the telescope to the bedroom. "It was the case we were working on, the victim was a bully to her classmates and apparently the kind you see in movies, like the really mean girl" he told you setting up the telescope in front the window pointing it up to the sky "I think I heard a little bit about that while at the lab this morning. So let me guess, one of the kids she bullied killed?" you questioned, sitting on the bed watching him "That's what we thought at first, but in the end it was the parents of two of the kids that were bullied." he replied still focusing the set up "That would have been my next guess, as they say parents would do anything for their children, so how did she die?" you asked curious "She was stoned to death." Ryan replied making a final adjustment to the telescope "Damn, he without sin, let them cast the first stone." you said with a painful expression "It's funny you said that because Tom said the exact same thing." Ryan said with a chuckle making his way towards you, after he was satisfied with the telescope and he joined you on the bed sitting next to you. "Great minds think alike." you said with a wink before continuing "From what you've said, a part of me thinks she deserved it but death was too much of an easy way out for her, she deserved to be still alive to suffer for her wrong doings." you said honestly with a shrug and Ryan gave you a look "What?" you asked him and he just smiled shaking his head "It just makes me think that you would do something like that for our children, if we had any." he said with a shrug and now it was your turn to give him a look "What?" he asked and you smiled "You think I would kill someone for our children?" he replied with a nod "Well you're not wrong." you replied with a tilt of your head and a shocked expression took over his facial features "Who did I marry?" he asked placing a hand on his chest being dramatic, so you rolled your eyes with a grin "I'm leaving." you told him getting up to leave the bedroom but he caught hold of your wrist pulling you back towards him to straddle his lap, you placed your arms around his neck while he held you at your hips "I'm kidding." he said laughing and you just rolled your eyes "You know I love you right?" Ryan told you sincerely but you wanted to have some fun with him for teasing you "And I love you Wolfie." you told him biting your lip holding back a laugh "Oh no you didn't." he said falling back onto the bed and flipping you both so that he was now above you and that made you release a scream as he started tackling you with kisses in your neck tickling you "Ryan, I'm sorry!" you told him in between laughs "What's my real name?" he asked you halting, looking down at you trying to catch his breath and so were you "Your name is Ryan Wolfe." you said with a glint in your eyes tempting to say Wolfie again and he realized you wanted to as well, so before you could, he replied "Good girl." and then crashed his lip on yours making you forget whatever thoughts you were having including the email you were working on.
