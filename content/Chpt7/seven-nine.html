            You had an awful day, and the moment you stepped through the door you released a sigh, and just thankful that you can put this day behind you. "Babe!" you called out taking off your shoes and then resting down your bags. You were met with silence, so you called out again "Baby!" still nothing, you knew he was home so you figured he's probably in the shower. You made a beeline for the bedroom, and heard the shower running in the bathroom, so you started stripping off your clothes heading for the bathroom. Entering you saw Ryan was indeed taking a shower and his back was towards you, so you moved quietly removing the remainder of your clothes before opening the door and hoping in, then quickly wrapped your arms around Ryan's torso catching him off guard "Hey!" he greeted making you giggle "Hi." you placed your head on his back hugging him, just enjoying the warmth his body gave "Now got in?" he felt you nod against him "Also had a very long day." you commented so Ryan turned in your arms to so he could take hold of you, resting his head on top of yours "Want to talk about it?" Ryan asked squeezing you "Nah, I just want to forget it." you said with a sigh so Ryan nodded "You got it." so you both pulled away and Ryan helped you wet your body "Did you cook?" you asked Ryan as he returned to his shower "Yes I did." that made you gasp turning to him "I was just joking but damn babe, you actually cooked?" you asked completely shocked and Ryan nodded "Yeah, because I knew when you come home, you'll be tired." Ryan stated making you go absolutely soft at that "Don't make me cry." you commented and Ryan chuckled taking you back in his arms. "Let's just finish shower and then get something to eat."

            "He died from sugar, damn, that's one sweet way to go." you commented and that caught Ryan off guard so he almost choked on his food "Babe, you just can't be saying things like that." he said after he recovered so you shrugged "What, too soon?" you joked and Ryan shook his head trying so hard to keep himself from laughing and just as you were about to say something else your phone rang, so you raised your finger "Hold on a minute babe." you said getting up going for the phone, and when you saw the name you released a heavy sigh "Dear Heavenly Father, give me strength." you prayed before answering the phone and Ryan watched you the whole time. It was the same co-worker that made your life a living hell today and the whole time on the phone you tried your best to remain calm just until the phone call was over. Ryan watched as you paced back and forth trying so hard to keep your cool. "Dick" you said the moment you hung up "Whoa, what was that about?" you were so close to throwing your phone across the room "I swear Ryan, if crime had to become legal for twenty-four hours, I am driving to that man's house and killing him the most vicious way known to mad." you said with pure venom laced in your voice and Ryan has never seen you this angry before "Okay, let's calm down first." Ryan said starting to stand and that immediately stopped your pacing, so you turned and gave him a glare "You don't ever tell a black woman to calm down." you warned with a pointed finger, so Ryan gulped not sure what to do, because he doesn't want to make you more upset. So remaining quiet, he allowed you to continue your pacing, slowing approaching you, so with a breath he decided to take a chance and ask a question "Do you want to talk about it?" he asked softly, trying to keep his voice calm and that worked because you just spilled it all to him, not leaving out any detail "Wow, he really does sound like a jerk." Ryan commented as you reached the end of your rant "Thank you!" you exclaimed turning to him with raised hands "As bad as he may be, I draw the line at murdering him." Ryan commented making you look him and Ryan thought he was in trouble again but a  smile broke out on your face "You're right, I wouldn't want to suffer on his behalf." you said stopping your pacing now and standing still in front of Ryan "Thank you." you said looking up at him and he smiled down at you "What for?" "For listening to me and being patient, and not adding more fuel to the fire." Ryan chuckled "I tried my best, because I never had to calm down a black woman before, but I know better now, you let them speak and you just listen." that made you grin up at him "Damn Mr. Wolfe, look at you, for some reason I just loved you more." you said grinning wider and Ryan joined "I am an amazing husband after all." Ryan commented so you reached up to peck his lips in agreement "That you are." just as your heels met back the ground, your phone rang, and it was your arch nemesis again and Ryan realized so he quickly took the phone from your hand and answered it "Heather's phone." Ryan answered and you looked on wanting to see how this plays out "Oh I'm sorry sir, she stepped out for a moment, and she won't be back for a very long time." Ryan said and you listened on, hand going to your mouth to muffle the laughter that's threatening to come out "I'm sor-, yo- br-ing up." Ryan said in a patchy voice, like a phone losing connection, then with nothing further he hung up so finally released the laughter making Ryan look towards you "He is a very loud man, and so rude." Ryan commented making you nod "Very." you added so Ryan handed you back your phone "You're not mad right?" you shook your head "Far from, that was pure pleasure right there." you said making Ryan laugh "Thank you, you're amazing." you said immediately wrapping your arms around him "Anything for you babe." he said bringing his arms around you as well "So shall we return to our dinner?" Ryan asked looking down at you and nodded "We shall."

            "Do you know that your phone is buzzing up a storm on your night stand?" Ryan asked as he entered the bathroom, while you were brushing your teeth "I know but, I have no more energy for that man." you said truthfully looking at Ryan in the reflection "Then just turn off the phone." Ryan commented so you shook your head "Not yet, I want him to know that I'm purposely not answering his calls." you said and Ryan chuckled "Spiteful, I love it." "Of course you would." you spat out now and washed your mouth. "So is he going to be a problem tomorrow?" Ryan asked as you dried your hands and mouth "Nah, I'll be at the lab tomorrow and only have to see him the day after, so I'm hoping by then some miracle happens and he's fired." you said with fingers crossed at the end "I'm sorry." "It's not your fault, we can't get along with everyone, yeah he sucks but I'm thankful he's not hating or targeting me because of my race." Ryan raised a brow at that "How can you be so sure?" "He has an adopted son, that's black, so I don't think he hates us, just me." you stated, so now Ryan was curious "Why does he hate you exactly?" that question made you sigh, so you started to make your way out the bathroom while replying "Because I do my job very well. Maybe too well to the point where they don't accept any of his ideas. I'm always fair and let him go first, help him out on things he can improve but he's so stubborn in his ways, and then gets mad when no one likes what he presents, but if he just for once listen to me and take my advice, then maybe, just maybe, they'll take something from him but no, he ju-" Ryan cut you off by grabbing your hand and stopping your pace "You're doing it again babe." so you sighed "Sorry, he's just gets me so riled up." you stated and Ryan chuckled "Maybe we should invest in a punching bag, so for times like this, you can just put all your energy into punching thinking the bag is him and I bet you'll feel so much better." the thought of it brought a smile to your face "I love the sound of that." you commented "There you go, that's something we can do, but for now, let's focus on getting rest." Ryan said holding your hand, dragging you towards the bed "But I'm not tired." you stated "Then, I guess I can tire you out?" Ryan asked with a raised brow making you chuckle "I mean you can tryâ€¦" you taunted and Ryan shook his head "You're so mean." he said so you pushed him back on the bed before going to straddle his waist "Not always." you said with a shrug and Ryan placed his hands on your hips, sitting himself back up "So do you want to or do you want to just watch tv till you fall asleep?" Ryan asked and you thought for a moment "Well, the first option makes me sleep better and I definitely need a good night's sleep." you said smiling making Ryan grip your hips tighter "I am loving these words that are leaving your lips." you chuckled at that "Such a pervert." you said with a shake of your head and not waiting for his reply, you crashed your lips on his swallowing whatever words he were about to speak.
