            "Ryan." you called alerting his attention "Yeah?" he asked looked towards you and you held up a pair of his sneakers "What on earth is happening to these?" you asked curious, because they were rapidly deteriorating "Oh, I guess it's because I've been chasing perks a lot more often lately." Ryan said making you meet his eyes "Ah really, how comes?" and Ryan shrugged "I guess the perps sensed that I'm more fit now, so they make me work harder." Ryan said making you chuckle "Maybe I should become a perp." you said with a raised brow and Ryan released a small laugh "Babe, we both know you won't get far." Ryan commented making you release a gasp "I know, but still." you said with a pout and Ryan chuckled coming over to you "I'm sorry." "And here I was planning on being an amazing wife and buy you a new pair of shoes, but you just had to be mean." you stated turning away from him "Now come on baby, don't be like that." Ryan said as he approached you from behind and hugged your waist but you remained quiet "Okay, I am sorry for saying you can't out run me." Ryan said and you could hear the smile on his lips "I know you're smiling." you said and he shook his head "Of course not." he protested so you turned in his arms and saw it yourself "We've been together for years Ryan." you said with a tilt of your head and Ryan chuckled not bothering to deny it anymore "Sorry, but I think it's cute that you think you can out run me." Ryan said looking down at you lovingly before giving a peck to your lips. If you ever want to get mad at him, you can't because he's just so sweet and cute. "You're lucky I love you and find you cute. Check under the bed." Ryan gave you a look before releasing you and going to check under the bed. Looking under, he spotted a shoe box before pulling it out. "What's this?" he asked as he sat on the bed, box in his lap before opening it "Do you like them?" you asked looking on as he took one of the shoes from the box "I love them. Thank you." he said smiling looking up at you before looking back towards the shoes "I'm glad because they'll replace these ratty ones." you said with a chuckle tossing the old shoes aside. "Then that means I'll wear them today, and you never know, I may get to test out their running ability." Ryan said as a joke.

            But it turned into a reality because that's how Ryan's morning started, while on the road he got a call about a running suspect, so he drove to the location entering the chase and Ryan thinks it was the longest chase he's ever been in and it almost ended with him ending up in a body of water, ending his life. "Did you hear about Ryan?" Dave asked as he entered back the lab and you shook your head "What did he do now?" you asked with a sigh, preparing to scold Ryan later "He threw himself over the side of a bridge thinking he could make the jump, but miscalculating and almost falling into the water below if it wasn't for Delko being there to catch him." you grabbed your head and released a huge sigh "I swear, that man is going to be the death of me." and Dave chuckle "Apparently the suspect was a football player, so it was an intense chase." Dave said and you shook your head "Ryan thinks he's superman." you commented while relaxing yourself making Dave laugh.

            You were now exiting the bathroom as Natalia was entering "Heather!" she greeted excitedly making you laugh "Natalia!" you greeted back with the enthusiasm "I just came from your lab looking for you, and Dave said you were here." she said "Okay, what did you need?" you asked and she grinned "I just saw Erika." she said and your eyes widen before smiling yourself "She's here?" you asked and she nodded "Then what are you waiting for, lead the way." you said quickly and she chuckled pulling you along. You both spotted her and saw she was in a room talking with Ryan. "Not us spying." you commented making her laugh "Okay let's pretend we're in conversation." Natalia suggested and you nodded "You think she's still a reported?" you asked and Natalia shrugged "I'm not sure but the fact that she came straight to Ryan still gives the vibes, she's probably hoping to get some info to leak." Natalia voice and you nodded "What are they doing now?" you asked and she looked over there direction, because you were backing and since Natalia is taller than you, she could easily look over your head to see what's going on "She's showing him something, looks like it's from a phone." Natalia said hoping you guys were closer, then her eyes suddenly widened before she looked back at you "They're leaving." she said quickly making you both hastily make your exit, when you both got a safe distance, you both bent over and laughed "What are we even doing?" you questioned and she shrugged "I have no idea, but that was fun." you nodded in agreement "You're going to ask him about the interaction?" Natalia asked curious and you shook your head with a smile "Nah, I don't have a need to." you said honestly because you trust Ryan and the only reason you left with Natalia was just to see how Erika looked now because it's been years since you've last seen her. "Okay let's get out of here before we're caught." Natalia said and you nodded with a grin "Yes, lets.".

            "Hey babe" Ryan greeted as he entered your lab "Hey hey" you greeted back with a quick look and grin before turning back to your screen "Where's Dave?" Ryan asked coming next to you "Just went on his lunch break, needed something?" you asked "Yeah, I just received a photo that was taken of the suspect and victim, so I was hoping to return to the scene to see if we could get an idea to who took the photo." you nodded listening on, and you figured that's what Erika showed him "Okay, so, would like me to be your partner?" you asked smiling up at him and Ryan grinned "Of course, actually thankful Dave isn't here." you chuckled at that "Just let me get my computer and we can leave." you told him "Yes mam."

            "Alright, raise it up a quarter then turn Ryan." you instructed as you looked at your laptop trying to make the image align "and tilt it down just a smidge." you told him focusing on your screen "Just a smidge huh? This day and age with all the technology at our fingertips, we're still referring to things in smidges." Ryan said making you grin "Incidentally this was the same camera that was used to take a picture of Brady and Kristen?" Ryan asked looking down at you "Oh yeah." you replied before explaining the software that you're using to him "It should be able to estimate the height of the photographer." you clarified at the end "Does it estimate to the nearest smidge?" Ryan said teasing you making you smirk "Are you all this smug with your computer techs that you bring into the field?" you asked with a raised brow and Ryan thought for a moment before replying starting with a nod "Yeah, Dave receives the same treatment, maybe worse." Ryan commented making you chuckle "I guess the difference between Dave and I is that one of us gives you sex." you remarked back leaving Ryan stunned before continued talking about the image "Every digital photo contains EXIF data that declares what kind of camera you use." you told him while handing Ryan the EXIF data sheet and as he looked at the sheet you told him what camera it was "Can you tilt it forward just a 'tad'." you told him avoiding the word 'smidge' "Whoa, stop. There it is." you said raising your hand for Ryan to stop "The exact height and angle that the photographer used." you said looking up at him now "They're a million different ways to hold a camera but at the end of the day, you gotta be able to see what you're shooting." you exclaimed standing up now as Ryan came to your side "So, using the angle of the camera, I can determine the eyeline." you said as it rendered on screen "Looks like our photographer was five feet three inches tall, basically around my height." you commented looking up at Ryan "Well that would eliminate Brady's agent." Ryan said entering a state of thought "So I'm guessing it's definitely not a guy." you stated "It's not a guy." Ryan confirmed "So we're looking for a girl." you nodded "And all we have to go on is the height" you mentioned towards him. As Ryan thought some more a person came to mind, it was one of the bottle girls that worked in the bar. Then he looked towards you "We make a great them." Ryan said down to you and you shrugged with a smile "Yeah, when you're not sassing me." you commented making Ryan chuckle "But you love when I sass you." "I do, but not when you're hiding something from me." you commented leaving Ryan confused but before giving him time to say anything you spoke up again "Let's head back, you got to get the girl brought to the station." you said starting to pack up your things, leaving Ryan in a state of thought as to what you could possibly mean.

            At was the end of your shift and you were walking down the hallway when you spotted Eric and Ryan in a room, so changing direction you headed there way "Hey guys, what's going on?" you asked to no one in particular as you entered the room alerting their attention "News." Eric said looking back at you before turning back and pointed at the tv, so you moved to stand between them as you looked on as well. It was Erika on tv reporting of the events of today regarding the case that you guys worked on. Just then she spotted Brady exiting the department building and approached him with microphone in hand asking him questions. He said what he had to say to his fans before making a final comment looking towards Erika "And you're not a journalist, you're a jackal." that left her stunned and the moment those words left his mouth you cackled out in a laugh, hand immediately going to your mouth to muffle the sounds and Eric looked towards before he busted out laughing as well and that resulted in you removing your hand joining him "Wow, I've never seen her speechless before." Ryan commented and you tapped his back "Of course you would know that." you commented before looking towards Eric with a grin and raised brow "That was amazing honestly, he took the words from my mouth." you said releasing a small laugh resulting in Eric laughing with you as well.

            The moment your shoes were off, you rested down your bag before taking off in the direction of the bathroom "Gotta pee, gotta pee." you kept saying on your way there resulting in Ryan laughing at you. Once you were finished in the bathroom you started taking off your clothes as you exited the bathroom heading into the bedroom and you saw Ryan was standing there with his arms folded clearly waiting for your return. So with your shirt discarded you stood there in your place, pausing due to Ryan's gaze "Speak." he said, more like commanded but you were confused "About what?" "When you said I'm hiding something from you, what do you mean by that?" Ryan asked and you released a sigh "It was just something I said, don't worry about it." you said moving again to take off your under shirt now "Really now?" Ryan asked with a raised brow, not moving his position as he watched you and you nodded slowly "Yes Ryan." he hummed and you removed your skirt now, stepping out of it, leaving you in your undergarments, so nodding his head, Ryan walked over to you. "You know, that I know when you're lying to me right?" Ryan said the moment he was in front of you looking down at you making you feel very small "I don't know what you talking about." you stated so Ryan leaned down to taking your hands in his before capturing both of them in his right hand behind you back, allowing your body to be push against his "So it doesn’t have to do with Natalia spotting me talking to Erika, then running off to find you, so you both could watch me?" Ryan asked as he lowered his head to your neck and you felt the fan of his breath as he spoke "You saw us?" you asked taken back so Ryan leaned up now to smirk down at you "I'm always aware of my surroundings, plus it's hard for you to hide your gorgeous self from me babe" Ryan commented making your face heat up "So were you ever going to say anything?" you asked him curious "About Erika coming to see me?" he asked and you nodded "I would of but I saw that you already knew, so I played along." Ryan said making your heart sink a bit at that "But I didn’t know you knew, so I figured you were going to hide it from me." you said truthfully and Ryan saw the hurt in your eyes "I would of told you though, so you wouldn't get the wrong idea." Ryan said calming your heart "You know I don't mind you guys having an interaction because I trust you, it's just I was worried if you would of said anything or not about it." you told him "Of course I would." Ryan replied truthfully "Cause I know if roles were reversed you would of wanted to know." you said with a shrug "Thank goodness none of them live in Miami." Ryan commented making you grin "Amen to that." you chuckled "So are you going to released me now?" you asked wriggling your hands in his hold and Ryan shook his head while taking hold of your hip with his free hand "Now why would I do that, when you practically just gave me a show turning me on." "Then why didn't you do something about it?" you asked with a smile "Well, we had something to discuss first and now that that's out of the way." Ryan said before finally releasing your hands before taking hold of your waist lifting you up allowing your legs to wrap his torso and arms around his shoulders "Now I can do something about it." Ryan said before capturing you lips, heading in the direction of the bathroom.
