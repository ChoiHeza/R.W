            Ryan was the first to wake up and was currently watching you sleep with a small smile graced on his lips. A part of him wanted to wake you up just so he could see your beautiful eyes and smile but he fought it because he knew how tired you are after working late last night and you had the day off so he settled on just staring at you. But sadly that didn't last long because his phone rang causing you to stir in your sleep, so cursing under his breathe he quickly got up to answer the phone, leaving the bed to put in distance as to not disturb you. In the end it turned out that Ryan got to wake you because the call was for you to come in as well. The person decided to kill two birds with one stone so turning back towards the bed, he saw you were facing away from now, still in deep sleep. With a sigh and a heavy heart he stalked back to bed sitting before bringing a hand to rest on your sleeping form. "Beautiful." Ryan said slowly rubbing your back, and he got nothing so he tried again. "Beautiful." he called again shaking you slightly this time and that cause you to release a groan "It's work, we gotta go in." Ryan said leaning forward now to place kisses on your exposed shoulder, waking you up more "Emergency?" you mumbled "All hands on deck situation." Ryan stated making you turn over onto your back to release a sigh before sitting up so you nodded with a stretch. "The final convict got away again." Ryan stated making you groan "Just when I thought we could request vacation." Ryan chuckled "Well, the day isn't over yet." "Well then, let's catch this son of a bitch because mama needs that vacation." you said and both you and Ryan high fived to that "Let's do this!" Ryan said cheerfully making you laugh.

            "Hey hey." came Ryan's voice as he entered your lab and you gave a small smile his direction "Is it just me, or does today seem more stressful than usual?" you asked as Ryan stood next to you and he nodded, head immediately going to rest on your shoulder "It is, but I'm hungry and I came to collect you for a quick lunch." Ryan said without leaning up making you chuckle "You have time?" you asked and you felt him nod "I made time and decided to take you with me." Ryan said leaning up now looking at you "Please." he begged and you grin with a nod "Of course." with that you finished up what you were doing before heading out with Ryan.

            "I forgot how delicious the burger from that place was." you commented as you guys got back and was heading to the locker room "Tell me about it. It's like we've been depriving ourselves from that delicacy." Ryan said making you laugh "Okay dramatic king." you said making Ryan chuckle as you both entered the locker room and you guys saw Natalia sitting on one of the bleachers so you both greeted her "Hey." she replied back but it wasn't her usual self so you and Ryan shared a look before looking back at her "You okay Nat?" you asked her then she paused before looking up towards you too and gave a said smile "Uh, no." she said and you saw she was hurting so immediately you left your locker and sat next to her, taking her hand in yours "I'm not okay. I thought that I was but I just keep," she said her voice starting to break so you offered her comfort to continue "reliving that moment, being trapped in that trunk, and uh I just really thought it was the end and I've had so many close calls this year, too many." Natalia spoke honestly and at the end Ryan was now sitting on her other side "I don't know if I can do it anymore." she said looking to the ground giving your hand a squeeze "I think I'm done." she said lastly so you and Ryan looked over Natalia towards each other talking telepathically and you told Ryan to say something because he knew her longer, so he nodded before leaning forward to meet her "You know, after I had my incident with the nail gun, ask Heather, I was afraid to go through a door, I was afraid to show up at a crime scene, I was afraid to look down a microscope, and besides Heather's constant encouragement, I also had this friend that told me 'You're bigger than any injury, you're better than what this job does to you' she also said 'You better get under that crime tape or you're going to get tangled up in it'" Ryan said making you and Natalia chuckle "Damn, I am profound." she said looking towards Ryan "You are because Ryan told me those exact words you told him to help me, and it worked, so you helped us both." you said with a smile as she looked to you now releasing a small laugh before wiping away some tears "You know what we think," Ryan started looking to you to finish "You're going to be okay." you finished for him and she grinned at that being thankful to having you both here with her "Yeah, thank you guys." she raising her arms to hug you both catching Ryan off guard but you gladly accepted it "We're here for each other, always." you reassured after you guys pulled apart and Ryan nodded in agreement "I have to head back to work butâ€¦" you started looking towards Ryan so he chuckled before looking to Natalia "Want me to walk you over there?" he asked her referring to interrogate the guy that almost killed her so she nodded "Yeah, I would like that." she replied with a smile "So, when you're interrogating the guy, give him hell." you suggested to Natalia making Ryan lean forward to look at you "Babe, you really got to stop suggesting that to people." Ryan scolded making Natalia chuckle "I love you but this man tried to kill her and H, so no, no more playing nice." you said then turned to Natalia "You got it?" you asked with a raised brow and she nodded with certainty "Give him hell, got it." she confirmed and you grinned giving her one more hug making Ryan sigh at you two.

            You and Natalia were currently in front the surface computer watching security footage that Ryan and Frank sent over "You know, I really appreciated you guys being there for me today." she said looking down at you grateful "You would of done the same for us, in fact, you did the same for us." you started resting a hand on her arm "I'm not trained like you guys, I'm just a computer genius that just happens to end up in similar situations like you guys, so I can somewhat understand what you meant when you said you were ready to leave. My low point was when our apartment was invaded and I was arrested and then coming home to a wrecked apartment, a place that's supposed to be my safety net from this crazy world we work and seeing that this crazy entered there, really broke me. You could even ask Ryan, I stopped functioning and was just ready to give it all up but doing that would of meant Settler won, and I didn't want that, sometimes we just need a break to and step away for a moment and then when we come back, we wouldn't want to be anywhere else." you said truthfully looking to her and she smiled "You're right, we just need a break but I'm sorry about what happened back then." you dismissed her "It wasn't your fault, plus you guys helped us moved and saved us a ton on a moving company." you said and you both chuckled at that "It was only fair, because you guys didn't deserve what happened." "And that's life, sometimes it kicks us down but we always rise back up stronger." you said with a wink at the end and she nodded "Agreed." you both shared a smile before turning back to the footage.

            "This is very much needed." you commented as both you and Ryan were soaking in the bath on opposite sides "Tell me about it." Ryan said with his head leaned back against the rim "And vacation in five days, I can't stop smiling." you said smiling once again making Ryan chuckle while he looked up to see you "You get to visit home." Ryan grinned happy for you "I can't wait." you said with a sigh, before slouching more so the water reached your chin and shook his head before leaning back and silence fell between the two of you "That was really sweet of what you said today, to Natalia." you commented and Ryan leaned up with a smile "This job can be tough but sometimes we just gotta be reminded that we are tougher." Ryan said making you grin "And I was surprised you brought up your fear pertaining your eye injury." Ryan chuckled "Well, it's just for her to relate to." you shook your head "I get that but I'm proud of you because you would deny back then how much it wasn't bothering you to the team, but look at you now." you said with a wide smile "Well.." Ryan started while leaving forward taking your hand pulling you towards him to sit on his lap, chest to back "I have someone in my life that told me it's okay to be weak sometimes because we're only human." Ryan said arms going around your torso to keep you flushed against him "I wonder who that is." you said playful and Ryan chuckled bringing his lips to kiss your shoulders "The most amazing person I've ever met, she's also really gorgeous, a total badass, a complete genius and the sweetest human being on this planet and you know what else?" Ryan questioned "What?" you asked turning to look up at him as he met your gaze "I get to call her my wife." Ryan said with a grin before placing a kiss on your lips.
