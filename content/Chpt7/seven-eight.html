            You felt kiss after kiss, being placed on your back, waking you up with a smile. "Good morning to you too." you giggled opening your eyes making Ryan stop, to meet your face "Did I wake you?" Ryan asked teasingly "You knew doing that was going to wake me." you commented and Ryan chuckled "Maybe. I'm just so grateful to have this day off with you." Ryan said placing kisses on your arms now "Did we get to sleep in?" you asked and Ryan checked the clock before turning back to you with a shake of his head "Not really, maybe like an hour but not much." he said and you sighed "But, don't lose heart, we can still stay in bed and don't have to worry about getting up." Ryan stated making you turn to your side now "We can do that, but we will get hungry eventually." "And that's okay, we can eat and return to bed." that honestly made you smile "This feels too good to be true." you said going closer to Ryan to cuddle into his front "What does?" he asked falling back, bringing you with him to lay on his chest, so you rested your chin there before replying "Us having an off day together, the whole day." you told him so he chuckled "Then don't jinx it, and let's just enjoy it." he said, arms tightening around you "So what do you want to do today, besides staying in bed?" you asked Ryan and he thought for a moment with a hum "We could be super lazy, and forget that we're adults with responsibilities. Order in food instead of cooking, you know, lazy people things." Ryan said making you laugh at the end "Not you speaking Bajan. I love it." "What can I say, you're rubbing off on me." that made you grin "That makes me happy to hear." you said before leaning forward to give him a kiss "I try my best." Ryan stated before looking back at you "Still sleepy?" you shook your head "It's gone, but I am getting hungry." Ryan raised a brow because an idea crossed his mind "Breakfast in bed?" Ryan asked and you grinned "Like in the movies?" Ryan gave you a puzzled look "In the movies, you know that happens in real life too right?" you were surprised "I thought it was just movies, because we don't do things like that." "We as in Bajans?" Ryan asked for clarification and you nodded "Well, we Americans do it, so that's what we're going to do." you got excited at that making you sit up "If I ignore the fact that we're eating in bed, it sounds really nice, is your OCD okay with that?" you asked and Ryan nodded "I'm ignoring it for now, and just enjoy this moment with my wife." Ryan said making you chuckle, cause you know deep deep down, this breakfast in bed was hurting you both but it's your day off together, so you want to enjoy it. "Okay, then I will go and get started on breakfast." you said moving to get up but Ryan grabbed your arm halting you "No, let me, because it's the husband that gives the wife breakfast in bed." he stated so you nodded slowly "Okayâ€¦, I think I do see that, well I guess I'll go shower instead and then return to bed waiting for you." you said starting to move again but Ryan kept you in place with a shake of his head "No, you will remain in bed, till I bring breakfast, we will eat together and then we can shower together." Ryan instructed making you chuckle "And this is the American way?" you asked and Ryan shook his head "No, this is the Ryan way." that made you grin, so you rest back in bed turning towards Ryan "Okay Ryan, I will do as told. I will remain here and watch tv till you return with breakfast, at least I'm able to go to the bathroom to wash my mouth right?" you asked and Ryan nodded "That you may do, but nothing else, and straight back to bed." you saluted "Yes sir." that made Ryan laugh at you.

            "Where's your green t-shirt?" you asked Ryan as you were going through his drawers "I think I have that in the locker at work, why?" Ryan asked "Because I wanted to wear it." you said with a sigh but decided to settle for a teal t-shirt instead "Do I need to get another one specifically for you?" Ryan chuckled "Not necessarily." you said putting on the shirt now before joining Ryan in bed "That sounds like a yes." he said making you laugh "Thank you." you said kissing his cheek before cuddling up into his side "I saw this movie named Oblivion with Tom Cruise, want to watch it?" Ryan asked and your eyes widened "Of course, my side man allowing me to watch my main man, what an amazing day to be alive." you teased making Ryan release a fake gasp "Since when was I your side man?" you shrugged leaning up to look at him "Since I loved Tom Cruise before I knew of your existence said." you stated trying to keep your smile at bay "Now that's not fear." you laughed at that "Don't worry baby, you're my main love and I would pick you over Tom Cruise any day." you stated but Ryan gave you a raised brow "I don't know about that but let's not test it." you both laughed before going back into your cuddle position to watch the movie.

            "Look at the view from the pool, it's gorgeous." you stated as the two characters on screen were in a pool "You got to admit it though, this right here is something we would do." Ryan said referring to the scene and you nodded "Definitely and yet we haven't, I think we should." you said turning to him with a smirk and just as Ryan turned to you to agree both your phones rang simultaneously making you look in the direction of your phones before back to each other "I think it's work." Ryan sighed and you nodded, so you both broke apart to answer your phones, and it was definitely work. "Well there goes our off day." you sighed getting up from bed "I told you not to jinx it." Ryan stated "But I didn't mean it." you were sulking inside "I know, the wicked just never rests." Ryan stated as you both started to get ready "They need to take a vacation because I want enjoy a whole day with you without interruption." "I'm sorry baby." you shook your head "Not your fault, but it is rewarding when we get the bad guy, so that's a plus." you said trying to remain positive "That's the spirit." Ryan commented "Don't make me hurt you Wolfe." you warned and Ryan raised his hands in a defensive position "Sorry." with that you both quickly got ready and left because it was an urgent all hands on deck situation.

            "Look who is in on her off day" came Walter's voice as he entered the lab "Yeah man, but after hearing the situation, I don't mind because whoever is responsible for this is cruel." you said kind of mad at the situation "It makes me mad thinking about it, and the fact that she's pregnant." you said shaking your head as Walter stood next to you "And I bet it's a bit more touching because you guys share the same name?" Walter asked looking down at you and you nodded "Of course. I just hope they're going to be okay." you said with a sigh "They're going to be, they're both fighters." Walter reassured and you smiled at that "So, what brought you by?" you asked entering back work mode "Nothing really, I saw Ryan and asked if you were here, so I just came by to shout you, you know I gotta check up on my small bear." you grinned at that "Well thank you big bear, I needed the visit." he returned the grin "Anytime, shout if you need anything." he said leaving the lab "Like wise." you told him and he waved his hand to let you know that he heard.

            Ryan and Walter were in the hallway talking as you were passing by "What's up guys?" you asked as you approached them with a smile, but it immediately left when you saw the annoyed look on their faces "What's wrong?" you asked and they both looked at you "We listened in to the interrogation of the husband." Ryan stated "Okay, and what happened?" you were confused "He did it." Walter said making your eyes widened "He's the one that rigged the car?" you asked and they both nodded so more confusion over took your features "I don't understand, that's his wife?" you asked looking between the two "Apparently he didn't want the baby because that would of taken his wife from him because he loved her oh so much." nothing Ryan was saying right now made sense to you, you were completely lost "Wait, he loves his wife and because of that he rigged the car so she would lose the baby, so that he'll have her all to himself?" you asked to see if you understood it right and they nodded "Yeah, something like that." Walter answered and annoyance over took your face "Well that's bullshit, and he really thought that was justifiable. I really hope when they lock him up, they throw away the key, because who does shit like that." you were completely heated now so Ryan reached out to take your hand in his to over some comfort then you remembered something "What about the baby, did she have it?" you asked and they shrugged "We don't know, Calleigh's with her though and she'll keep us updated." you nodded at that "Ya'll better than me cause I would of punched the guy." you said forming a fist making them both chuckle at you "Alright, calm down spit fire, we don't want you getting in trouble." Ryan commented "Plus, I would of beaten you to it." Walter added making you smile at that, so you both shared a high five "Now that's what I'm talking about." you said giving him an up nod and Ryan just shook his head at both of you.

            "Ryan, how do people like that exist?" you questioned Ryan as you both walked to the kitchen after just getting home "They just do." Ryan stated "But like, that's just pure evil, and it's like he just didn't care." you said shaking your head getting heated again so Ryan quickly to hold of both your hands in his making you look at him "He got what he deserved, and the mother and baby are healthy and safe now so don't allow him to affect you. Just let go." Ryan instructed so you nodded taking calming breathes but it was easier said than done "But, he's just a trash of a man, and deser- " Ryan cut you off by placing his lips on yours after shaking his head with a smile because usually when he tells you to let go, you never do and you continue your ramble, so he stops you with the kiss, the kind that leaves you dizzy "Better?" Ryan asked grinning "I honestly can't remember what I was talking about." you replied still in a daze "Perfect, let's get something to eat, I'm starving." Ryan said then placed a peck to your lips "And since it's supposed to be a lazy day, let's order in." Ryan said heading for the menu drawer "Let's order pizza!" you inputted leaning over the counter and Ryan chuckled "You got it." he replied 'That kiss works like a charm.' Ryan thought to himself before  pulling out his phone.
